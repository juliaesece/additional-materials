As the 28th edition of the Conference of the Parties (COP), the world’s foremost climate summit, begins in the United Arab Emirates on November 30, Africa is grappling with some of the deadliest impacts of a heating planet. The Horn of Africa, which suffered adrought earlier this year, is now battling floods. From Somalia to Kenya, extreme weather is forcing massdisplacement. Earlier this year, Cyclone Freddy, the longest-running tropical storm, hit Southern Africa, killing at least1,000 people. Amid these crises, the African Group of Negotiators (AGN), which is currently chaired by Zambia, will speak for the continent at the COP28 talks in Dubai. Although Africa is responsible for less than 5 percent of global emissions, it is disproportionately affected by negative climate change impacts. So, for African countries, fighting climate effects is urgent — and a matter of survival. Some of the biggest issues that the AGN will focus on, according to chief negotiator Ephraim Shitima, are a just energy transition and climate change finance, including funding for adaptation. Most countries by now agree that a pivot or transition away from fossil fuel production or consumption to renewables is inevitable, but a key issue African leaders are pushing is the continent’s right to a just transition. African countries, many of them low and middle-income developing economies, are negotiating for opportunities to accelerate theirfossil fuel productionto enable them to industrialise, before reinvesting those gains in green energy sources. The argument is that since developed countries became so by burning fossils to build factories and create generational wealth, African countries too, must be given the chance to accelerate their own development and provide energy to the millions lacking it on the continent, using these same fuels, particularly gas, which is seen as less polluting by some. At the moment, more than 600 million Africans do not have electricity and about 900 million cannot access clean cooking methods. There has been strong pushback on this position from the European Union but also African climate experts and activists. Some say all fossil production should be abandoned as there is no evidence that oil and gas-rich nations like Nigeria have reinvested oil wealth in renewables or even in development. A “dash for gas” will leave the continent stranded with assets that no one wants while renewable sources like wind and solar will help “leapfrog” development, others argue. “Both sides of the argument are actually right,” former African Union (AU) climate adviser Faten Aggad said. “Africa is vulnerable when oil prices crash, and that confirms what the activists are saying and whether we like it or not industry and trade are moving to renewables with major economies launching trade measures that threaten African countries,” she said. Aggad was referring to the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism which will see importers of goods taxed based on the amount of CO2 emitted during their production. On the other hand, “we are between a rock and a hard place”, Aggad said. “We are being sold this dream of renewables but we barely have any investments in it. Gas is the only option available to Africa.” Despite the controversies, the AGN at COP28 will propose that developed countries stop investing in fossil fuel projects by 2030 and let developing nations fill that gap.  The issue of climate financing is set to come up once again. African countries have been demanding that rich countries support them with funds to build infrastructure and put in place measures that will help them adapt to a changing climate and a warmer world – infrastructure like sea walls for those countries facing significant sea level rise problems, for example. Those demands are in line with a UNFCCC principle enshrined in several agreements and resolutions called Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR), which acknowledges that while every country must be responsible for contributing to driving down temperatures, some countries are historically more responsible than others, and should take a lead in solutions. So far, the adaptation funds flowing to Africa have been a trickle. Rich countries promised $100bn in annual climate financing for developing nations back in 2009, and renewed that pledge at COP26 in Glasgow; but as of 2020, only $83bn was being raised annually. Onereportnotes that most of that money has been made available through loans and targeted countries outside Africa. Meanwhile, the continent needs more than $500bn for climate change adaptation costs through 2030, of which about $11bn was available in 2020.      African negotiators have had success in recent summits. Intense lobbying – alongside countries from other regions – for more than three decades finally led to the creation of afund for loss and damageat last year’s conference in Egypt. For years, developed nations blocked the creation of the fund, which is meant to see low-emitting developing nations not historically responsible for global warming, get paid for the irreplaceable loss of lives, culture, and infrastructure by climate change, whether in Africa, Asia or elsewhere. Many see the enshrining of the fund in the final joint agreement as a big win for the fight for climate justice. The funds have not materialised yet, and it is still unclear where the money will come from precisely, as well as whether the largest emitters, like Russia and China, which are still under the “developing” nations category will also be required to contribute to the fund. A loss and damage transition committee is expected to present a suggested framework that will outline who contributes and who benefits from the fund in Dubai. COP talks have mostly focused on talk rather than action, especially from rich countries expected to provide climate financing and drastically cut their carbon emissions. Unfortunately, Aggad, the former AU adviser, said, African negotiators are usually unable to counter their richer counterparts. At the talks, lobbyists from developed countries often far outnumbered those from Africa or Asia. “The AGN focuses too much on COP when for developed countries, it’s more of a foreign diplomacy business with multiple ministries working on getting concessions on deals that AGN is not even aware of so by the time they get to COP, a lot has been sorted,” she said. “Africa needs to rethink how to negotiate. COP is just a moment [but] you need to tell your story in a continuous manner in the global space.” There is a lot at stake for African countries should COP negotiations this time fail to take the continent into account at a final sign-off. Already, Africa is warming faster than the rest of the world, according to an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, and sea levels here are rising faster than the global average. Besides, climate change progress for Africa is tightly wound with the continent’s development agenda. It is why African negotiators and leaders say they are more prepared to push for the funding and the leverage they need at COP28. Signalling their readiness, African heads of states planned ahead at the first African Climate Summit in Nairobi in August. In the resulting Nairobi Declaration, they urged their richer counterparts to commit to past funding pledges, reform unfavourable tax regimes, reduce borrowing costs for African countries, and restructure their debts. In addition to pursuing a right to use gas as a transition fuel, African leaders are also keen to position their countries as ones that can be crucial to climate solutions due to the continent’s natural resources and manpower needed to deliver infrastructure for renewables. Although Africa holds 40 percent of the world’s solar energy potential, for example, it has less than 1 percent installed capacity.               Follow Al Jazeera English:",-1.0,0.0

On horseback, he rode to a well with nearly a thousand sheep and goats. Occasionally, he and his wife, Nurmaa, stopped to help struggling young ones, weak after a harsh winter — putting a lamb in the warm comfort of a van and hand-feeding a foal rejected by its mother. The animals would need strength for the trek eastward across vast, hilly grasslands. Thousands of miles away in Senegal, Amadou Altine Ndiaye’s family led livestock through a sparse African savannah dotted by acacia trees and brush. Horses and donkeys pulled a four-cart caravan along dirt paths in sweltering heat. Cattle followed behind. Ndiaye brought up the rear, wearing a traditional conical hat and contorting his mouth to make sounds only he and his animals could understand. They were traveling from the town of Nayde in the northeast to a village even further east — they believed it would be richer with vegetation. Ndiaye, a member of the Muslim Fulani ethnic group, learned the ways of animal herding alongside his elders. “I was born into pastoralism, and since then I’ve known only that. There were cattle and sheep present at my birth,” the 48-year-old said. “It’s a source of pride.” More than 50 million people in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere practice and treasure this way of life. As nomadic pastoralists, they keep domestic animals and move with them to seek fresh pastures — often selling some of their livestock for meat. ___ EDITORS’ NOTE — This story is part of The Protein Problem, an AP series that examines the question: Can we feed this growing world without starving the planet? To see the full project, visit https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/the-protein-problem/index.html ___ Although nomadic pastoralism has sustained these populations for millennia, it faces mounting pressures from deterioratingenvironments, shrinking rangelands, and new generations who seek a less grueling and tenuous life. At the same time, pastoralism is modernizing, with groups leveraging new technology to better care for their animals. But the practice has survived for so long because it is designed to adapt to a changing environment — pastoralists move with their animals to find fresh pasture and water, leaving behind fallow land to heal and regrow. “The broad view is that having mobile animals enables you to leave places that are overused or that have scarce water orfoodresources and move to places where there are more resources,” said Forrest Fleischman, who researches natural resource policy at the University of Minnesota. “And that means you’re not going to hammer the one place you’re stuck in.” Experts say it is a lesson that could help those who raise livestock at much larger scales adapt and reduce the impact of animal agriculture on the environment. Pastoralists aren’t only trying to outrun climate change; they’re combatting it. “They have the Indigenous knowledge,” said Edna Wangui, a geography professor who studies the practice at Ohio University. “There is a lot we can learn.” Perhaps more than any other place, Mongolia is known for pastoralism. The practice is enshrined in the nation’s constitution, which calls its 80 million camels, yaks, cows, sheep, goats and horses “national wealth” protected by the state. For families like Agvaantogtokh’s, pastoralism is more than a profession. It’s a cultural identity that connects generations across time. And at its heart is the human connection to animals. Agvaantogtokh and his family sell animals for meat. They also sell dairy products such as yogurt and hard cheeses. While they consider the animals their property, they also see them as living beings working alongside them for a common purpose. Researchers say herders believe in “animal agency.” Agvaantogtokh lets his livestock pick what grass, flowers or herbs they eat, and find their own water. To him, fencing an animal and asking it to eat the same thing every day is like putting a person in prison. Weather extremes are a part of life in Mongolia, and managing them is increasingly difficult as the environment changes. When Agvaantogtokh thinks about climate change, he worries about what it means for humans and livestock. One spring day, he felt the wind whip up and watched blue skies turn menacingly dark. In the distance, he spotted a wall of dirt rushing toward him. “Dust storm,” he muttered. His father, Lkhaebum, left a bowl of soup half-eaten on the table. Both set off on motorbikes to make sure their animals were safe. “We need more rain,” said Lkhaebum, who like other Mongolians uses only his given name. “If the grass isn’t growing, it is very challenging for us.” Chronic drought plagues Mongolia. So does warming. Since 1940, the country’s government says, average temperatures have risen 2.2 degrees Celsius (nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit) — a measure that may seem small, but for global averages, scientists say every tenth of a degree matters, and a warming world brings more weather extremes. And dzuds — natural disasters unique to Mongolia caused by droughts and severe, snowy winters — have grown harsher and more frequent and can keep livestock from accessing water or food. A dzud pushed Agvaantogtokh and his family to move out of a southwestern province after a disastrous winter killed 400 of their animals. They’ve been in the eastern province of Sukhbaatar since 2020. The family lives simply. They have a sink with a rubber pump to limit water use. They live in a tent called a ger, which has wooden circular frames insulated with sheepskin and felt, and doors facing east to let in the morning sun. Nurmaa, who married into this way of life, uses a boiler fired with horse dung to cook and stay warm. “Year by year,” she said, “I have learned a lot of things.” Herding and birthing animals. Helping set up camp. Cooking big meals of breads, stews, milk tea and homemade wine. But every place the family moves its ger, she has a sense of a settled life. Each belonging is systematically placed in the same spot — something stable and predictable in a world of constant change. In Senegal, caravans carry the comforts of a furnished home, such as a metal bed frame and mattress, and water for people and animals. With the rainy season approaching earlier this year, Ndiaye, his son-in-law Moussa Ifra Ba and the rest of the family prepared for a 170-kilometer (106-mile), 16-day trek. Water and plentiful grass have become harder to come by. “One of the main difficulties related to pastoralism is the lack of grazing,” Ndiaye said. “The livestock are hungry, and you sometimes have trouble selling one because it is so thin.” “Many varieties of tree have disappeared, and even our children are unaware of certain species,” Ba said. “The best varieties of grass no longer grow in certain areas, and the most widespread grass is more like rubber: It fills the belly but doesn’t nourish the animals.” Meals for Ndiaye’s family rarely include meat and are carefully planned. Only when they pass through certain villages can they stock up on food — vegetables, rice and other essentials. Overall, per-person meat consumption in Senegal is among the lowest in the world; rates are more than six times higher in Mongolia. Ndiaye’s family doesn’t sell their animals regularly because meat is mostly for special occasions: weddings, or holidays such as Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr. When they do, a few head of cattle can provide enough money to get married, buy rice or even emigrate. The family has the same deep respect for their animals that Mongolian pastoralists do. Ba is especially drawn to the sheep. He’s noticed that the rams cry when they move away from him, remember the names he gives them and come when they’re called. “It’s a real friendship,” Ba said. In their four-cart caravan, young people and young animals both get special care. Ndiaye’s 5-year-old daughter, Aminata, and 2-year-old granddaughter, Aissata, ride atop one cart with the women. In another, baby sheep too young to walk for long in the heat are bound together with netting. Ba said he can’t imagine any other life: “A village without cows has no soul.” To keep their practice alive, pastoralists around the world are looking for ways to modernize. In Mongolia, Lkhaebum recently began using a motorbike to more easily search for horses, which are never kept fenced. One nippy morning, his calf-length tunic billowed around him as he began a search, stopping occasionally to peer through binoculars toward a herd grazing on a faraway hill. The family also has a solar-powered battery that runs a television and washing machine, a karaoke machine, and a cellphone to keep track of weather and access Facebook groups where herders exchange information. “We now have 4G cellular data, and it helps us a lot in communicating and getting forecasts,” Nurmaa said. “It really helps us a lot with communicating with our children because they’re far away.” Their 18-year-old daughter studies medicine in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar. Their two younger children, a 13-year-old son and a 9-year-old daughter, are in school. The son spoke about becoming a herder when he was in his early teens. But not anymore. “I won’t regret anything if my child won’t be a herder,” Nurmaa said. “I would like them to do what they aspire to do.” Her view is not unusual. “If you asked parents, very few of them want their children to grow up to be pastoralists,” professor Wangui said. “They want their children to be something else because they’re seeing the life of pastoralists is a tough life.” Though modern tools promise to make things easier, many pastoralists run into obstacles. Those in Senegal, for example, often struggle to find signals for their cell phones. They rely mostly on older technology and methods. One evening, Ndiaye’s grown daughter, Houraye, peeled onions for the family’s meal, stirring a pot of rice illuminated by the glowing embers of her fire. When it was ready, her seven relatives gathered under the stars with small flashlights and turned on the handheld radio they charge off their solar panel. The bleating of sheep nearly drowned out the traditional melodies. An important advancement in infrastructure has helped the family: water towers known as forages that have sprung up with government assistance. Previously, finding water could require a 35-kilometer (22-mile) trek. Now, the family plots trips along the path of these towers, where they can refill their jugs and replenish their animals in long troughs. Still, some leaders don’t offer help to pastoralists. Conflicts between herders and settled farmers also can erupt surrounding land use and access to water. A few advocacy groups advise pastoralists to choose settled lives for their own good. In Senegal’s Sahel region — where the United Nations estimates 65% of meat and 70% of milk sold at local markets come from pastoralists — the head of the Association for Promoting Livestock Farming in the Sahel and Savannah suggests people put their children in school and diversify incomes. “Climate change has caused enormous damage, and people are not aware of the dangers that lie ahead,” said Moussa Demba Assette Ba. “If you invest all your income in livestock and disaster strikes, you lose everything, and that’s what climate change can do.” The former pastoralist built a home in 2006 that has since turned into a sprawling compound that provides solar power to neighbors. He encourages others to settle down as he has and seek ways to increase the quality, not quantity, of their animals. But perhaps the biggest threat to pastoralism comes from within, as the next generation chooses other paths. Four of Ndiaye’s seven living children don’t travel with their parents. He relies on help from Ba and a paid family friend to direct the animals to their destination. Ba, 28, and his wife Houraye, 20, have a 2-year-old daughter and want to expand their family. They mused about a future in which at least one child stays in pastoralism while at least one goes to school. “I’d like my children to keep up with the changing world,” Ba said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

He needed coalition partners to form a parliamentary majority and signed a deal with the leftist Hlas, or Voice, party and the Slovak National Party to govern together. The deal gives Smer the post of the prime minister and six other Cabinet ministers, opening the way for Fico to serve as Slovakia’s head of government for the fourth time.

The Indian Mission to Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and the ministry of agriculture and farmers' welfare have jointly organised the 'Asean-India Millets Festival' starting November 22 during which a Millet-centric exhibition is being held featuring participation from Millet-based FPOs, start-ups and Indian chefs. ""The Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) participated in the ASEAN-India Summit and East Asia Summit on September 7. During the ASEAN-India summit, one of the joint statements adopted was about food security,"" India's Ambassador to Asean Jayant Khobragade said. ""In two months, we are having the Millet Festival which also covers food security. That is how effectively our comprehensive strategic partnership is working,"" he said. Describing millets as one of the important elements for ensuring food security, he said this was very well in the overall framework of the ASEAN-India relationship. ""There is a lot of interest. For this millet festival, we have representation not only from Indian farmers and industrialists but also from Asean member states,"" he added. Khobragade also highlighted the crucial role of millet in addressing global hunger and nutrient deficiencies. Arief Prasetyo Adi, Head of the National Food Agency (Badan Pangan Nasional (BPN)) Indonesia, underscored millets as a farmer-friendly and sustainable food choice for the future in the face of climate change. He said that the Asean -India Millet Festival has an opportunity to raise awareness of the benefits of millet, from nutritional status and environmental sustainability to economic development. The 'ASEAN-India Millets Festival', at the Kota Kasablanka Mall, a prominent shopping destination in south Jakarta, aims to create a market for millets and millets-based products among the Asean Member states. The 10 member countries of Asean are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia. Millets can grow on arid lands with minimal inputs and are resilient to changes in climate. They are, therefore, an ideal solution for countries to increase self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on imported cereal grains. India spearheaded the UN general assembly Resolution for declaring the year 2023 as the 'International Year of Millets', a move aimed at addressing food security challenges. The year will also promote the sustainable production of millets while highlighting their potential to provide new sustainable market opportunities for producers and consumers. India's department of agriculture and farmers welfare is leading a delegation at the event, representing a diverse set of professionals from Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), industry leaders and more. A Millet-centric exhibition is being held as part of the festival featuring participation from Millet-based FPOs, start-ups and Indian chefs. The exhibition also aims to foster collaboration between Asean countries, celebrate cultural and culinary diversity and promote sustainable millet practices for a healthier future. The exhibition features five Indian FPOs, namely Citi Block FPC, Jewargi Taluka Millets FPC, Bhumitrajalalpur, Vaam Agro, and Lambasingi Tribal Products FPC, and two start-ups namely Taru Naturals and Sattva Millets and Food Products (Mibbles) exhibiting unique millet-added products such as millet cookies, namkeen, khakhra, cakes, and more. Ankit Patel, who represented Ahmedabad-based Vaam Agro company that deals in spices, said that he started manufacturing the millets-based products just four months ago and till now the company has sold products worth Rs 50 lakhs. ""We have started with six Millets products, including Dhokla and Khakhra. Our products have got a great response,"" Patel said. Indonesia-based Rizal Satria said that he started manufacturing millet-based products three years ago when very few people in his country knew about such products. ""Now more people know about it and we expect a steady growth in our Millets business of Millets,"" he said. A major highlight of the festival is the live cooking workshop, where celebrity chefs from India and Indonesia will showcase the culinary potential of millets.",1.0,0.0

[+] Bletchley Park, in central England, on November 2, 2023. (Photo by DANIEL LEAL/AFP via Getty Images) The recent artificial intelligence safety summit convened by U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has revived a bad idea—creating an “IPCC for AI” to assess risks from AI and guide its governance. At the conclusion of the summit, Sunak announced an agreement was reached amongst like-minded governments to establish an international advisory panel for AI, modeled after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC is an international body that periodically synthesizes the existing scientific literature on climate change into supposedly authoritative assessment reports. These reports are intended to summarize the current state of knowledge to inform climate policy. An IPCC for AI would presumably serve a similar function, distilling the complex technical research on AI into digestible synopses of capabilities, timelines, risks and policy options for global policymakers. At a minimum, an International Panel on AI Safety (IPAIS) would provide regular evaluations of the state of AI systems and offer predictions about expected technological progress and potential impacts. However, it could also serve a much stronger role in approving frontier AI models before they come to market. Indeed, Sunak negotiated an agreement with eight leading tech companies, as well as representatives from countries attending the AI safety talks, that lays a foundation for government pre-market approval of AI products. The agreement commits big tech companies to testing their most advanced models under government supervision before release. If the IPCC is to serve as a template for international AI regulation, it is important not to repeat the many mistakes found with climate policy. The IPCC has been widely criticized for assessment reports that present an overly pessimistic view of climate change, emphasizing risks while downplaying uncertainties and positive trends. Others contend the IPCC suffers from groupthink, as there is pressure on scientists to conform to consensus views, thereby marginalizing skeptical perspectives. Additionally, the IPCC’s process has been criticized for allowing governments to stack author teams with ideologically-aligned scientists. Like its IPCC predecessor, an IPCC for AI will likely suffer from similar problems related to politicization of research findings and shortfalls in transparency in assessment processes. Confirming reason to worry, the AI safety conference in the U.K. has similarly been criticized for its lack of diversity in viewpoints and narrow focus on existential risks, suggesting bias is already being baked into the IPAIS even before its official creation. This impulse to create elite committees of experts to guide policy on complex issues is nothing new. Throughout history, intellectuals have warned that only they can interpret arcane information and save us from catastrophe. In the Middle Ages, the Bible and Latin mass were inaccessible to the common man, placing power in the hands of the clergy. Today, highly technical AI and climate research play an analogous role, intimidating the layperson with complex statistics and models. The message from intellectuals is the same: heed our wisdom, or face doom. Of course, history shows the intellectual elite often errs. The Catholic church notoriously obstructed scientific progress and persecuted “heretics” like Galileo. Nations that embraced economic and technological dynamism flourished, while those that closed themselves off behind backward religious dogmas stagnated. Climate activists today hold similarly dogmatic views, resisting innovations like genetically modified crops and nuclear energy that would reduce poverty and protect the planet. Empowering a tiny intellectual elite to guide AI governance would repeat these historic mistakes for a number of reasons. First, the IPCC has blurred the line that separates policy advocacy from science, to the detriment of science as a whole. As my Competitive Enterprise Institute colleague Marlo Lewis once put it, “Official statements by scientific societies celebrate groupthink and conformity, foster partisanship by demanding allegiance to a party line, and legitimate the appeal to authority as a form of argumentation.” One of the most pernicious effects of the IPCC has been to popularize the idea of an international “consensus” surrounding public policy discourse, shutting down rigorous scientific debate that would otherwise transpire. Scientific facts will always be open to a variety of interpretations. We should not entrust a small priesthood of AI researchers to judge what is safe and to be permitted. An IPAIS will homogenize and politicize AI research, jeopardizing the credibility of the entire AI research agenda. Second, a global AI governance body would discourage jurisdictional competition. The IPCC sets arbitrary goals and deadlines upon which nations are supposedly obligated to act. But different nations have varying risk tolerances and philosophical values. Some will accept more uncertainty, risk and disruption in exchange for faster progress and economic growth. Instead of asking for one-size-fits-all commitments from nations, we should encourage countries to implement diverse policies in response to diverse viewpoints, and then see what works. Third, regulations arrived at through precautionary international bodies, based on manufactured consensuses, will inevitably be overly pessimistic and overly restrictive. No one should be surprised that the IPCC has mainstreamed the most alarmist emissions scenarios, given the historic tendency of intellectuals to see themselves as the saviors of humanity. AI has immense potential to benefit civilization, from spurring healthcare innovations to promoting environmental sustainability. But excessively stringent regulations based on alarmist predictions will block beneficial applications of AI. This is especially true if AI systems are subjected to centralized vetting procedures. The hazards of AI, like other technologies, are real. As AI progresses, thoughtful governance is needed. But the solution is not a globalist technocracy to direct its evolution. This would concentrate too much power in too few hands. Decentralized policies targeted at concrete harms, combined with research and education from a diverse range of viewpoints, provides a path forward.

Today, we have a special guest with us.  Joining Kirby, it's Mike Pyle, the Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics here at the NSC.  He has aa few words at the top, and then we'll go into questions. Mike. MR. PYLE:  Thank you.  Thought I would offer a little bit of perspective on APEC and President Biden's events today around APEC Leaders' Week. So, President Biden is going into APEC Leaders' Week at a moment when this dynamic Asia-Pacific region is looking to the United States as an engine of growth, and that is not an accident.  The President has spent nearly three years now strengthening our economic foundations at home and building our alliances and partnerships across the Indo-Pacific. President Biden will make it absolutely clear that the United States will continue to engage, both diplomatically and economically, in this critical region.  And he'll make it clear why all this matters for the American people. So, in the morning, the President will deliver remarks at the CEO Summit.  He'll talk about the strong economic ties between the United States and other APEC economies — ties that are delivering for people and communities across the region. He'll highlight, for example, the fact that thanks to his policies, companies based in other APEC economies have invested more than $200 billion into the United States since the start of the administration.  And he'll announce that a number of U.S. companies have also invested at least $40 billion in other APEC economies — economies in 2023 alone. He will talk about how this is happening on top of a strong economic foundation. U.S. trade with APEC economies is robust and growing.  So, 60 percent of U.S. exports are sent to a fellow APEC economy, and U.S. exports to the region are up 12 percent in real terms since 2016.  APEC members have invested $1.7 trillion into the U.S. economy.  Those are investments that support 2.3 million American jobs. And the United States is the largest source of foreign direct investment into APEC. In fact, U.S. foreign direct investments into APEC is six times greater than that of — than that of the PRC.  And U.S. companies, in turn, have invested about $1.4 trillion into APEC economies. And he'll talk about his work to build on top of this strong economic foundation to chart a new chapter of inclusive, sustainable, and resilient growth throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, he'll talk about the importance of promoting workers' rights internationally, just as he has done here at home, and how worker empowerment is key to achieving sustainable growth. After the CEO Summit, President Biden will lead the first APEC session with other leaders focused on sustainability, climate change, and the energy transition. He'll highlight U.S. progress to combat climate change, and he'll call on APEC economies to take collective action.  And, of course, he'll underscore this administration's efforts to model how to undertake the clean energy transition while creating good jobs and growing the economy. President Biden will also demonstrate this administration's commitment to deepening economic engagement with the region through IPEF — the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. You'll see that on full display at the IPEF event later today, which will also feature leaders of Japan, Vietnam, and Singapore. Since we announced IPEF a year and a half ago, this framework has always been about tackling pressing, cutting-edge issues that will determine future economic success — issues like supply chain resilience and the clean energy transition — and the issues that are at the forefront of global economic discussions today. President Biden will spotlight the great progress we've made.  This week, ministers will sign the Supply Chain Agreement, and they'll substantially conclude the Clean Economy Agreement and the Fair Economy Agreement.  These are first-of-their-kind agreements, concluded in record time. We've also made progress on the trade pillar negotiations, and we'll continue this work in the weeks and months ahead to reach a high-standard trade pillar outcome. Today and throughout this week, you'll also be hearing from several — you'll also being several key themes echoed by multiple Cabinet officials and senior administration officials. So, this morning, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo will co-host an investor forum with White House Senior Advisor on Energy and Investment Amos Hochstein to announce new investment opportunities in the Indo-Pacific.  This builds on the work we've led through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. They will be joined by CEOs to launch two new IPEF and PGI initiatives in which the United States and IPEF partners will more strategically deploy public capital to promote high-standard investment in the region, including a new IPEF-PGI Investment Accelerator. And they'll announce a green transition credit fund to invest in solar, wind, hybrid, storage, e-mobility, and other green transition projects in India, as well as a number of other significant investments in critical minerals, digital infrastructure, and the energy transition. Second, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Director of the White House National Economic Council Lael Brainard, and Chair of the U.S. Export-Import Bank Reta Jo Lewis will co-host an event to highlight examples of significant job-creating investments in the United States by companies based in the Asia-Pacific. This ""Invest in America"" event will highlight a number of high-quality investments being made in communities across the country supporting high-quality jobs, and in huge part because of President Biden's policies which have made America a — an incredibly strong magnet for investment from around the world. And last but not at all least, as I mentioned at the top, you'll hear about the important efforts we're undertaking to advance workers' rights internationally. President Biden is the most pro-labor president in history, and he's committed to ensuring high labor standards, bringing workers' voices to the decision-making table, and enforcing rules against unfair labor practices. That's true here at home.  That is also true around the world. Last today, the President is expected to take historic steps to advance workers' rights around the world.  And today, Secretary Blinken, Ambassador Tai, Acting Secretary Su, and NEC Director Lael Brainard will highlight this bold initiative.  This is a critical part of what we are bringing to the table as the United States concludes its APEC host year. In closing, the President and all of us have a busy day ahead of us here in San Francisco with a great set of events and a great set of announcements, all of which will highlight the deep commitment, the deep dynamism of American engagement through the APEC region and the degree to which our engagement in APEC supports economic growth and, importantly, strong, high-quality jobs back here in the United States. And with that, I'm happy to take any questions. MS. REPOSA:  Thank you.  Our first question, we'll go to Aamer with the AP. Q    Thank you, Mike.  When you talk about — just sort of stepping back a little bit — will these — the IPEF framework, is that essentially going to be the new normal rather than trade deals being the model?  Can we see frameworks like these now being the set for other regions in the world? And if Kirby's on, I was hoping that he could also suss out a little bit more about what the President meant yesterday when he said the war will end when Hamas no longer maintains the capacity to murder and harm Israelis.  Essentially, does the President believe it's possible to get a point of zero risk to Israel from Hamas?  Thank you both. MR. PYLE:  So, on your first question, Aamer, I would say, in my discussions around the world — in the President and Cabinet officials, even more to the point, discussions around the world — what's clear is that the issues that are front of mind right now are issues like supply chain resilience, issues like the clean energy transition, issues like how do we tackle things like corruption and tax fairness to build a strong, level playing field for the global economy.  These are the issues that are front of mind in discussions, front of mind for leaders, front of mind for ministers. And it's where we think we can make tremendous progress in terms of building a more inclusive, more sustainable, more high-growth global economy.  And that's reflected in the types of — the types of discussions and the types of frameworks that you see — that you see here. So, you know, as I said, we expect to see substantial conclusion of pillars in record time around topics like that in IPEF today, and I think that, you know, we've seen issues like this at the forefront of discussions with other key allies and partners. So, for example, if you look back to June, when Prime Minister Sunak was in Washington, we announced a framework there that similarly tackled cutting-edge issues around supply chains, clean energy, much else beside.  So, I think IPEF is an ambitious framework that's landing outcomes in record times on these cutting-edge issues. But I think when you look at the UK, you look at other partners, it's fair to say that this approach of tackling the most front-of-mind, most cutting-edge issues in the global economy today is the way the President and other leaders want to advance global economic discussions. MR. KIRBY:  Hey, Aamer.  As you heard the President say yesterday, certainly, the Israeli and the Defense Forces protecting them, and the — have the right and the responsibility to eliminate what is, to them, an existential threat posed by Hamas. I mean, Hamas leaders have come out publicly since October 7th and said that their intention is to attack Israel again and again and again, and they said, quite frankly, that they want to remove that country from the face of the Earth.  So, that is the threat that the Israeli people are facing from Hamas.  And — and that is the threat that they are militarily trying to — to minimize and reduce. And what we have learned through our own experience is that — that through military and other means you can absolutely have a significant impact on a terrorist group's ability to resource itself, to train fighters, to recruit fighters, to plan and to execute attacks. I mean, look at the — the shadow of itself that ISIS is right now.  Look at the shadow of  that al Qaeda is right now. And that doesn't mean that — that the ideology also withers away and dies, but you can absolutely have a practical, meaningful effect on a terrorist organization's ability to conduct and execute its attacks.  And that is what Israeli Defense Forces are trying to do.  And that is what, as the President said yesterday, we're going to continue to do to — that we're going to continue to help them do by continuing to make sure they have the tools and the capabilities to go after it. MS. REPOSA:  Thank you.  Our next question, we'll go to Justin with Bloomberg. Q    Hey, guys.  Thanks for doing this.  I wanted to ask about IPEF as well.  It seems like the delegations were told to expect kind of an early harvest on the — on the trade pillar last week, but then, over the weekend, the U.S. pulled that down amid some pressure from congressional Democrats.  So, I was wondering, you know, what do you say to countries that feel like this is another reason to question U.S. sincerity or work outside those domestic political concerns. And then, Mike, I know you said there's going to be more work on that in the weeks and months ahead.  Does that mean a reasonable expectation that there will be at least that early harvest announcement before next November, or is this really — realistically kind of on ice until after the election? MR. PYLE:  So, thanks for that, Justin.  And I'd say a couple things.  You know, one, most trade negotiations take years to complete.  But we have said from the beginning that IPEF will be — will be negotiated on an accelerated timeline, and I think the results that leaders will announce today reflect that. Like I said, the issues that are front of mind, the issues that are at the cutting edge of the global economic conversation — issues like supply chains, clean energy, good government — you know, these are first-of-their-kind agreements, and we have struck agreements around them in just 18 months with a full set of IPEF partners.  And we're proud of that achievement and proud that the President is going to be standing shoulder by shoulder with other IPEF leaders today to mark that — mark that success. With respect to the trade pillar, we're going to, you know, keep at that.  There's been progress that's been made.  In the weeks and months ahead, we expect to continue putting shoulders against that effort, both here in the United States as well as with another IPEF partners.  We're going to do that in a way that continues to consult intensively with leaders on Capitol Hill, with a full set of stakeholders back here in the United States — including, importantly, our friends in the labor community. And we're going to keep at this and build on the progress that we've seen. But, again, I would just underscore: This has been 18 months since this was announced.  Here we are in November of 2023, and we're announcing the conclusion of — of three pillars on the most cutting-edge issues facing the global economy. And that is a significant achievement and one that reflects the — the importance of the IPEF grouping and our ability to get things done through it.  And we'll continue building on that as we look ahead. MS. REPOSA:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Mary with ABC. Q    Hi there.  Good morning.  John, a question for you.  Wondering if the President received any assurances from Xi that he will, in fact, use his influence over Iran to try and urge Tehran and their proxies not to try and escalate this, to stop attacking U.S. forces in the region. And, you know, so far, despite America's retaliatory strikes, these drone and rocket — rocket attacks against American forces have not been letting up.  So, what comes next?  I mean, what can you do to try and get this message across just to these militant groups without risking further escalation? MR. KIRBY:  Well, it's not just about sending a message, Mary.  It's about protecting our troops and our facilities.  And if — if attacks continue, we're going to respond appropriately.  And as I said before, we'll do it in a time and a manner of our choosing. We've already shown that we'll — that we'll take action to go at targets that actually get at the support that these groups are getting from the IRGC. Now, on the conversations with President Xi on this issue, I don't have more detail to provide coming out of meetings yesterday.  I will say that — that we know the PRC has communication channels to Iran that we obviously don't have. I mean, it's not like we can't send messages to Iran, and we certainly have with this regard about escalation.  But we know that the Chinese have more — more direct lines of communication open to them.  And we certainly would encourage them to use those lines to — to reiterate to the Iranians that we — we don't want to see a deepening or an escalation of the conflict in the region. Q    And was that message conveyed yesterday? MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, again, I'm not going to go into more detail about the conversations that — that we had.  But I can tell you that we know they've got — we know they have some influence.  We know they have some lines of communication, and we certainly would like to see them use it to that effect. Q    Thank you. MS. REPOSA:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to David with Reuters.  David, you should be able to unmute yourself. Q    Yeah, so sorry about that.  Yeah, I've got a couple of questions on the talks yesterday — the President and the Chinese leader.  We heard that President Xi had outlined some of the conditions for an intervention — a Chinese intervention in Taiwan.  I was wondering if you could give us any details of what he had said about that. Also, do you have any details you can share on what was agreed specifically on fentanyl? And the — the Chinese government has reacted quite negatively to the President's remark — off-the-cuff remark at the end of the press conference yesterday, calling Xi Jinping a ""dictator.""  Has that remark undone some of the diplomacy?  And is — is it regretted in any way?  Thank you. MR. KIRBY:  The President comes away from the meeting yesterday feeling very good about the — the content of the — of the discussions over the course of four hours and the progress that we were make — able to make on some very significant fronts. You mentioned one: fentanyl.  Of course, the other is the military-to-military communications channel being back open.  They made progress in terms of getting their two teams to start working together on cooperation on artificial intelligence, particularly when it — when it involves national security concerns.  So, there was an awful lot they talked about. I won't — the Pr- — you know, I won't speak for President Xi.  I can't do that. But certainly, the issues around the Taiwan Strait came up.  And President Biden made it very clear, as he made it clear to all of you last night.  He made it clear to President Xi that we don't seek conflict; we — we're pursuing peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait — that's what we — we wanted and still want; that there's no change to our One China policy; that we don't support independence for Taiwan, but that we will, in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, continue to provide self-defense capabilities to — to Taiwan; and, again, made the point that we don't want to see the status quo changed in any sort of a unilateral way and certainly not by force. On fentanyl, we can try to get you some — some more detail.  But the — the gist of it is that the — the chemical ingredients that go into making fentanyl — many of them are — are produced in China and shipped from China to Latin America, where the cartels get them and then fashion them into fentanyl for then movement out of the region and into the United States, in particular. And the Chinese, for several years now, have not been willing to crack down on the production of these precursor chemicals and/or their export.  And now they're willing to do that, particularly in the — in the realm of law enforcement — and really doing their best to — to minimize the — the export of these chemicals, particularly to Latin America. One of the things that President Xi told President Biden yesterday was he doesn't want to see another American die because of fentanyl.  So, he — he places a personal commitment into — into — to making some progress here.  So, we're very hopeful that it will have a very practical, significant effect here over time. And I'm sorry, there — oh — no, I think — no, I think I answered all your questions. MS. REPOSA:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Yasmeen with the Washington Post. Q    Hi, thanks for taking my question.  Kirby, I have two for you. One is: I'm wondering if you have any additional information or comment on what the U.S. knows about how Hamas is using Al-Shifa Hospital.  Israel is conducting its raid for the second day and hasn't released more evidence of substantial militant activity in the hospital.  And so, I know that there's increasing pressure.  I'm wondering if the U.S. is asking them to expedite the raid or produce any more evidence that would sort of quell some of the anxieties. And then my second question is — President Xi yesterday indicated that China might send more pandas to the United States.  And I'm wondering if you have anything more on that. MR. KIRBY:  I — I can't add to anything that President Xi said yes- — last night at the CEOs dinner about the pandas.  He indicated a willingness to think about returning some of them. Look, we — we obviously appreciated having them here, and we respect the — the sovereign decision that China made to remove some of those pandas.  And certainly, should — should a decision be made by the PRC to restore some of the pandas, as the United States, we would absolutely welcome — welcome them back.  But that's got to be a decision that ob- — obviously President Xi makes. On the hospital.  As I said the other day, we have our own intelligence that convinces us that Hamas is using Al-Shifa as a command-and-control node and — and most likely as well as a storage facility — and that they were sheltering themselves in a hospital, using the hospital as a shield against military action and placing the patients and medical staff at greater risk.  We are still convinced of the soundness of that intelligence. I will, as always, let the Israeli Defense Forces speak to their military operations' progress: what they're learning, what they're seeing.  That's really for them to speak to.  But as I said the other day, we're confident in our own intelligence assessment about how Hamas is using that hospital. MS. REPOSA:  Thank you.  Our next question will go to Deepa with NPR. Q    Hey, all.  Thanks for doing this.  I was wondering if you could give an update on Brett McGurk's travel throughout the Middle East and Europe the past couple of days.  Where has he been so far?  Who has he met with?  And can you give any specifics on where he is today and — and any deliverables and the meetings he's had? MR. KIRBY:  Yeah, we'll get back to you on the — the specifics of his agenda.  He's been moving around quite a bit.  And to be honest with you, I'm — I'm not sure what his schedule looks like today. But the trip started in Brussels, and then he went right into the region.  And, you know, as he — as we announced when he went — I mean, multi-pronged effort here: Update NATO and our allies and partners about what we're doing to support Israel and the region and to get humanitarian assistance in, to get the hostages out.  And he's having discussions on the ground with our counterparts about all those things — certainly with — with Israel about the progress of their operations, about the security assistance that they are getting and that they need; and about the importance of continuing the humanitarian assistance. And we — we did get more trucks in overnight.  And so, that's — that's been — that's been going pretty well.  I mean, obviously not as many as we want to see get in, but — but trucks continue to flow. Humanitarian pauses continue to go apace, if not expanded, in some cases, in terms of the hours that they're in place. The Israeli Defense Forces opened up another corridor out of North Gaza here over the last 24 hours that — that does appear to be working in terms of people taking advantage of it. And Brett will also be, obviously, heavily engaged in — in the ongoing negotiations to get the hostages out and speaking to a range of our partners, including the Qataris, about work — work on that front.  You heard the President talk about this briefly yesterday.  And this is really something we've been working hour by hour, and that's going to be high on Brett's agenda for this week. But in terms of the — the actual muscle movements, let us take that question and — and get back to you all with — with something more specific. MS. REPOSA:  Thank you.  We have time for one more question.  So, we'll go to M.J. Lee with CNN. Q    Hi, thank you for doing this.  I had a quick question for Mike and then the Admiral as well. President Xi is courting the American business community while he is here and telling them that China is open for business.  Does the administration believe that it is safe for American businesses to invest with China? And then for you, John, just back to Al-Shifa Hospital.  The President said himself that he was absolutely confident that there is a Hamas command center under the building, and you just pointed to U.S. intelligence showing that.  But can you say whether the Israelis have shared with the U.S. any new intelligence since the raid began that has bolstered your confidence?  Thank you. MR. PYLE:  Thanks, M.J. So, to your question, I mean, obviously, U.S. businesses are going to have to make their own decisions.  What I will say is that, you know, when we look at the trade investment data between the U.S. and China, we see, you know, ongoing, strong bilateral trade investment flows. Last year, for example, was the record year of bilateral trade between the United States and China.  And those are trade flows, those are investment flows that — that we welcome, that the United States welcomes. You know, I think that, as you've undoubtedly seen, there are very specific areas — areas around specific — like technology sectors that can lead to military modernization, that can lead to surveillance and intelligence modernization, where we have deep concern.  And whether it be through export controls or the outbound investment program that we announced in August, we want to take action to prevent that very narrow set of investment flows and of exports. So, broadly speaking, again, you know, last year was a record year of bilateral trade between the United States and China.  There continues to be a strong, robust trade and investment relationship between the two countries.  And that is something that — that we welcome. And — and welcome — with one last point: You know, we've talked — the President has talked about the importance of there not being decoupling between the U.S. and China, but rather the importance of — of being sure that we're de-risking our economy. And I think what I just described is a reflection of that fact: strong and ongoing trade and investment flows between the two countries, very narrow target areas of concern where we're using our tools to ensure that there isn't investments with our exports (inaudible) that can compromise our national security.  And that's the type of approach that I think is very consistent with this idea that we're not decoupling but de-risking. MR. KIRBY:  Hey, M.J.  On your other question, I think you can imagine we stay in daily touch with our Israeli counterparts and certainly interested in — in their perspectives: what they're seeing, what they're doing, what they're learning.  I'm not going to talk about specific intelligence that — that may pass between the two of us. I would just go back to what I said before and what I said on the airplane coming out here: Our own intelligence assessment is that Hamas was using — is using Al-Shifa as a command-and-control node and potentially as a — as a storage facility to support their — to support their planning and their execution of terrorist attacks in the region — again, placing these people at greater risk, the staff and the patients at that hospital.  And we're confident in our own intelligence assessment of that. And I'll let the Israelis speak to — to what is, quite frankly, an ongoing military operation. MS. REPOSA:  Thank you.

Ambassador Nikki Haley, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The climate is changing. That is something all of the current presidential candidates can agree on. ​​​​​​​But that's about as far as the similarities go. In the first GOP primary debate, moderators could not get candidates to raise their hands to signify their views on climate change when asked this question: ""Do you believe human behavior is causing climate change?"" When Republicans do push for climate action, they say the focus should be on China and India — pressuring those top polluters to do more. Most GOP platforms also call for increasing domestic energy production — while continuing to rely on fossil fuels. They often oppose regulations and subsidies to incentivize clean energy production and electric vehicles. By and large, climate is not a driving force at the macro level of American elections. But it's an issue that is top of mind for young votersacross party affiliations. People of color, who are often most affected by the impacts of climate change, and women also consistently say the issue should be a priority. Here is where Republican presidential candidates stand on the nuances of climate change. Loading... All the candidates can agree that the climate is changing and that extreme weather disasters are a problem. But not all are on the same page about humans being the driving force. During the last presidential election, former President Trump said that humans caused climate change ""to an extent,"" but then largely doubled down on calls for forest management, which he described in2018 as raking leaves, rather than offering ideas to rein in planet-warming pollution. There is overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is driven by human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels. Still, many within the GOP seeany acknowledgment by their presidential candidates as progress in a partythat, for the last decade, has dug deeper into rejecting widely accepted science about the warming planet. Loading... Regardless of the scientific consensus that fossil fuels are the leading cause of climate change, all Republican presidential candidates want to prioritize oil, gas and fossil fuel extraction. Former President Trump wants to ""DRILL, BABY, DRILL,"" while also expanding nuclear and hydropower. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis wants to ""unleash oil and gas exploration"" — though in 2020 DeSantis blocked 20,000 acres of wetlands in Florida from drilling. While North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum prioritizes coal, oil and gas, he also wants to increase carbon capture and sequestration projects, a controversial climate solution backed by big industries and the Biden administration that would capture carbon dioxide before it leaves smokestacks and inject it deep underground. Loading... The two candidates most upfront about climate change, Haley and Christie, primarily want to confront other countries like China and India about their role in reducing emissions. China contributes the most to climate change, followed by the United States and India. Still, the U.S. is by far thelargest historical contributorto climate change, along with other rich countries, and has significantly higher per capita emissions than either China or India. None of the GOP candidates offered plans to cut planet heating emissions–what scientists say is the lynchpin to preventing global temperature increases that would trigger events like catastrophic sea level rise, mass extinctions and even more lethal heat waves. All candidates generally discuss the U.S. role in addressing climate change through a protectionist lens —  the discussion typically reverts to the development of fossil fuels — reducing reliance on foreign energy sources and domestically producing as much as possible. Loading... Like former President Trump, most candidates have vowed to pull the U.S. out of the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord, under which nations pledged to cut greenhouse gas pollution to rein in climate change. Nearly 200 nations signed it, and most have developed individual plans to cut climate pollution. Under the Paris Agreement, the U.S. promised to reduce its emissions by about 25% by 2025 compared with 2005 levels. In 2021, President Biden brought the U.S. back into the agreement. He also revised the U.S. pledge, committing to cut emissions by about 50% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. New research conducted by an international group of scientistsfound that it's unlikely — though not impossible — for humanity to meet the temperature reduction targets set by the agreement in 2015. Countries would have to take even more aggressive steps to cut fossil fuel development and use, a position that runs counter to the GOP candidates' plans. Loading... Carbon capture is a proposed climate solution backed by the Biden administration and major fossil fuel companies, utilities and other major corporations. It involves trapping carbon dioxide before it leaves smokestacks, and injecting and storing it deep underground. But the idea is highly controversial. It's expensive, and many pilot projects have failed. It has to be sent by pipeline to places where it can be injected underground, and communities nationwide, including in Red states, are pushing back against these pipeline projects. Trump previously signed a law approving tax breaks for companiesthat use carbon capture technology. In his home state of Florida, DeSantissigned a memorandum of understandingwith a South Korean company to store carbon underground in space and aerospace industrial complexes in Florida. Burgum has touted carbon capture in his state andagriculture industry. Carbon capture technology received a boost from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which funneledbillions of dollars into carbon capture hubs. But many scientists and environmental groups argue carbon capture is an excuse to keep extracting fossil fuels. Andwhen carbon dioxide pipelines rupture, they can cause asphyxiation in humans and animal life in a sizable radius. Loading... President Biden's sweeping climate bill was shepherded through Congress without any Republican votes. It includes tax credits that have madesolar and wind energy cheaperandprovides tax credits to promote the use of electric vehicles.A year after it was signed into law, nearly $280 billion in investments have been made,a vast majority to Republican-held districts. Still, Republicans vying for the presidential nomination have been some of the sharpest critics of the law, vowing to take steps to strip elements of it or repeal it altogether.

In the U.S., organizations such as the Advanced Biofuels Association (ABFA) and the Advanced Biofuels Business Council (ABBC) are promoting the development and use of advanced lignofuels, hence boosting the market growth. Through research and policy advocacy, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) promotes the global transition to sustainable energy sources, including cellulosic ethanol. The availability of investment and capital has a considerable impact on the market dynamics of lignofuels. Research and commercial projects rely on financial support to scale production, conduct pilot studies, and overcome technical challenges. The financing available determines the rate of technological advancement and commercial expansion. Challenges: Lignofuel production, particularly from lignocellulosic biomass, can be costly. The procedures required to convert complicated biomass structures into usable fuels, such as enzymatic hydrolysis or gasification, can necessitate substantial investment, reducing the economic sustainability of lignofuel production. The technological complexity of lignofuel production technologies, such as biochemical and thermochemical procedures, can make scaling up from laboratory or pilot-scale production difficult. However, efficient and scalable procedures are critical for the economic feasibility of lignofuels. These factors are likely to hinder market expansion. Regional Trends: Asia Pacific Lignofuels Market is expected to register a major market revenue share and is projected to grow at a high CAGR in the near future. Growing public awareness of climate change as well as environmental issues has resulted in increased efforts to minimize carbon emissions. Lignofuels, as a renewable and low-carbon alternative, are positioned as part of the solution to address climate change issues in the Asia-Pacific area. Some nations in the Asia-Pacific area have set biofuel mandates and targets to encourage the use of renewable fuels in transportation. Compliance with these rules boosts demand for lignofuels as a key component of the biofuel mix.  Curious about this latest version of the report?

Released ahead of the 2023 climate summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, theEmissions Gap Report 2023: Broken Record – Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions (again),finds that global low-carbon transformations are needed to deliver cuts to predicted 2030 greenhouse gas emissions of 28 percent for a 2°C pathway and 42 percent for a 1.5°C pathway. ""We know it is still possible to make the 1.5-degree limit a reality. It requires tearing out the poisoned root of the climate crisis: fossil fuels. And it demands a just, equitable renewables transition,"" said   Antònio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations   . Maintaining thepossibility of achieving the Paris Agreement temperature goals hinges on significantly strengthening mitigation this decade to narrow the emissions gap. This will facilitate more ambitious targets for 2035 in the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and increase the chances of meeting net-zero pledges, which now cover around 80 percent of global emissions. ""There is no person or economy left on the planet untouched by climate change, so we need to stop setting unwanted records on greenhouse gas emissions, global temperature highs, and extreme weather,"" said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. ""We must instead lift the needle out of the same old groove of insufficient ambition and not enough action, and start setting other records: on cutting emissions, on green and just transitions, and on climate finance."" Broken records Until the beginning of October this year, 86 days were recorded with temperatures over 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. September was the hottest recorded month ever, with global average temperatures 1.8°C above pre-industrial levels. The report finds that global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increased by 1.2 percent from 2021 to 2022 to reach a new record of 57.4 Gigatonnes of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (GtCO 2 e). GHG emissions across the G20 increased by 1.2 percent in 2022. Emissions trends reflect global patterns of inequality. Because of these worrying trends and insufficient mitigation efforts, the world is on track for a temperature rise far beyond the agreed climate goals during this century. If mitigation efforts implied by current policies are continued at today's levels, global warming will only be limited to 3°C above pre-industrial levels in this century. Fully implementing efforts implied by unconditional Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) would put the world on track for limiting temperature rise to 2.9°C. Conditional NDCs fully implemented would lead to temperatures not exceeding 2.5°C above pre-industrial levels. All of these are with a 66 percent chance. These temperature projections are slightly higher than in the 2022 Emissions Gap Report, as the 2023 report includes a larger number of models in the estimation of global warming. Current unconditional NDCs imply that additional emissions cuts of 14 GtCO 2 e are needed in 2030 over predicted levels for 2  °  C. Cuts of 22 GtCO 2 e are needed for 1.5  °  C. The implementation of conditional NDCs reduces both these estimates by 3 GtCO 2 e. In percentage terms, the world needs to cut 2030 emissions by 28 percent to get on track to achieve the 2  °  C goal of the Paris Agreement, with a 66 percent chance, and 42 percent for the 1.5  °  C goal. If all conditional NDCs and long-term net-zero pledges were met, limiting the temperature rise to 2°C would be possible. However, net-zero pledges are not currently considered credible: none of the G20 countries are reducing emissions at a pace consistent with their net-zero targets. Even in the most optimistic scenario, the likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5°C is only 14 percent. Some progress, but not enough Policy progress since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015 has reduced the implementation gap, defined as the difference between projected emissions under current policies and full NDC implementation. GHG emissions in 2030 based on policies in place were projected to increase by 16 percent at the time of the adoption of the Paris Agreement. Today, the projected increase is 3 percent. As of 25 September, nine countries had submitted new or updated NDCs since COP27 in 2022, bringing the total number of updated NDCs to 149. If all new and updated unconditional NDCs are fully implemented, they would likely reduce GHG emissions by about 5.0 GtCO 2 e, about 9 percent of 2022 emissions, annually by 2030, compared with the initial NDCs. However, unless emission levels in 2030 are brought down further, it will become impossible to establish least-cost pathways that limit global warming to 1.5  °  C with no or low overshoot during this century. Significantly ramping up implementation in this decade is the only way to avoid a significant overshoot of 1.5  °  C. Low-carbon development transformations The report calls for all nations to deliver economy-wide, low-carbon development transformations, with a focus on the energy transition. The coal, oil, and gas extracted over the lifetime of producing and planned mines and fields would emit over 3.5 times the carbon budget available to limit warming to 1.5°C, and almost the entire budget available for 2°C. Countries with greater capacity and responsibility for emissions – particularly high-income and high-emitting countries among the G20 – will need to take more ambitious and rapid action and provide financial and technical support to developing nations. As low- and middle-income countries already account for more than two-thirds of global GHG emissions, meeting development needs with low-emissions growth is a priority in such nations – such as addressing energy demand patterns and prioritizing clean energy supply chains. The low-carbon development transition poses economic and institutional challenges for low- and middle-income countries but also provides significant opportunities. Transitions in such countries can help to provide universal access to energy, lift millions out of poverty, and expand strategic industries. The associated energy growth can be met efficiently and equitably with low-carbon energy as renewables get cheaper, ensuring green jobs and cleaner air. To achieve this, international financial assistance will have to be significantly scaled up, with new public and private sources of capital restructured through financing mechanisms – including debt financing, long-term concessional finance, guarantees, and catalytic finance – that lower the costs of capital.

COP28 and the Global Stocktake The first Global Stocktake (GST), concluding at COP28, will inform the next round of NDCs that countries should submit in 2025, with targets for 2035. Global ambition in the next round of NDCs must bring GHG emissions in 2035 to levels consistent with 2°C and 1.5°C pathways while compensating for excess emissions until levels consistent with these pathways are achieved. The preparation of the next round of NDCs offers the opportunity for low- and middle-income countries to develop national roadmaps with ambitious development and climate policies, and targets for which finance and technology needs are clearly specified. COP28 should ensure that international support is provided for the development of such roadmaps. Carbon dioxide removal The report finds that delaying GHG emissions reductions will increase future reliance on carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide removal is already being deployed, mainly through afforestation, reforestation, and forest management. Current direct removals through land-based methods are estimated at 2 GtCO2e annually. However, least-cost pathways assume considerable increases in both conventional and novel carbon dioxide removal – such as direct air carbon capture and storage. Achieving higher levels of carbon dioxide removal remains uncertain and associated with risks: around land competition, protection of tenure and rights, and other factors. Upscaling of novel carbon dioxide removal methods is associated with different types of risks, including that the technical, economic, and political requirements for large-scale deployment may not materialize in time.",-1.0,-1.0

Evidence of  climate change  is all around us. If the planet is to avoid even more severe consequences from  global warming , the International Energy Agency, the world’s leading energy authority, says, consumption of oil, coal and natural gas needs to be reduced much more rapidly, and clean energy sources like wind and solar power need to expand at a far faster pace. But the  stock market  doesn’t seem to have gotten the memo. Instead, the shares of a broad range of clean energy companies have been crushed lately, in a rout that encompasses just about every alternative energy sector, including solar, wind and geothermal power. At the same time, rather than weaning themselves off oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two biggest U.S.  oil companies , are doubling down. They have announced acquisitions that will vastly increase their oil reserves. Exxon intends to buy Pioneer Natural Resources, a major shale drilling company, for $59.5 billion. Chevron plans a $53 billion purchase of Hess, a big integrated oil company. These are enormous bets on oil for years to come. It’s a perplexing state of affairs. The evidence that carbon emissions are warming the planet is persuasive. Yet the stock market, which is supposed to be forward-looking, is treating alternative energy companies with disdain and big oil companies with respect. There’s something wrong here, obviously. I think the problem resides with the stock market, not the scientists. Benjamin Graham, the great value investor and Columbia professor, once said, “In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” That means that eventually the market gets things right, but in the short run, it’s prone to enthusiasms, snap judgments and myopic thinking. That seems to be what’s happening now. The Big Picture The scientific consensus is clear. It sometimes seems there is a new and compelling study on climate change, with disturbing conclusions, every day. Last month, for example, in its latest comprehensive report on the world’s chances of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the International Energy Agency said the climate is warming all too rapidly. The probability of a benign outcome is receding, it said, yet odds will improve if the world shifts aggressively from fossil to alternative fuels. In a separate study released this past week, a group of scientists said the planet probably has only a little over five years before global warming exceeds the most ambitious goal of the Paris climate agreement: warming of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above temperatures that prevailed before the Industrial Revolution. Breach that limit and there will be catastrophes far worse than what we have experienced so far, the study said. The planet already has warmed 1.2 degrees Celsius. Governments, companies and consumers around the world need to take aggressive measures to curb carbon emissions immediately, the study said. If the stock market heeded such calls to action, you might expect that alternative energy shares would be booming and that big oil companies would be pouring most of their money into renewable resources. But in its collective wisdom, the stock market seems to be embracing a contrary vision. Stock Losses Hundreds of billions of dollars are, in fact, being invested in  renewable energy  projects, even if the stock market generally isn’t favoring them right now. The returns are ugly. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the entire industry, is down more than 30% this year. Even worse, since the start of 2021, it has lost more than 50%. Narrower sectors are being punished, too. The Invesco Solar ETF is down more than 40% this year and almost 60% since Jan. 1, 2021. The First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF has lost about 20% this year and about 40% since Jan. 1, 2021. Rising interest rates have increased costs and tempered consumer enthusiasm in many countries, reducing stock valuations for fast-growing companies that aren’t churning out big profits. Renewable energy companies have been hard hit. SolarEdge, which provides equipment needed to convert energy from solar panels into power that can be transmitted through electric grids, warned on Oct. 17 that demand for its products was lagging. The market responded harshly. Shares of the company, which is based in Israel, dropped nearly 30% in a single day. A host of other solar companies followed. Enphase Energy, a rival firm in Fremont, California, has lost almost 40% since Oct. 17. Wind energy companies haven’t been spared either. Shares of Orsted, the Danish wind turbine company, fell nearly 26% Wednesday after it said it might have to write down as much as $5.6 billion on the value of its offshore wind projects in the United States. One Orsted venture, South Fork Wind, a set of turbines being installed 30 miles east of Montauk Point, is scheduled to start sending electricity to Long Island before the end of the year. But the company canceled two projects, known as Ocean Wind 1 and 2, that were to supply New Jersey with green energy, and some of its projects for New York and Connecticut have run into trouble, too. In October, the New York Public Service Commission rejected requests from Orsted and several other companies — including BP and Equinor — for billions in electric rate increases to help defray their ballooning costs. The companies say that with inflation and higher interest rates increasing their costs, the viability of some of their projects in the New York metropolitan area is in doubt. Betting on Fossil Fuel Big oil company profits and revenue have flagged since last year, when energy prices soared after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. For the entire S&P 500, earnings per share in the third quarter grew only 2.7% from a year earlier, John Butters, a senior earnings analyst for FactSet, estimated. Exclude the big energy companies, though, and that total increased to 8.4%. That’s because earnings per share for big fossil fuel energy companies declined 38.1%, more than for any other sector. Oil prices are volatile, and their trajectory in the years ahead is far from certain. But Exxon and Chevron are staking their futures on oil. Exxon’s acquisition of Pioneer would be its biggest purchase since it bought Mobil in 1999. And Chevron will deepen its commitment to oil by acquiring Hess. Though I know better, I can’t stop thinking of Hess as “the green company.” That’s only because I’m an old New York Jets fan. Hess shares corporate history and a green-and-white motif with the Jets. Leon Hess founded the company, owned the team and liked the color green. But the Hess product line is petroleum based. But no matter. Oil has been good to Hess’ shareholders, and to shareholders of the three other companies. Over the past three years, Exxon has returned about 275%, including dividends; Chevron, 135%; Pioneer, 260%; and Hess, a whopping 310%. The S&P 500 returned about 32%. As long as the world consumes oil, companies like these will be profitable, or so oil bulls say. Plus, there is a wild card. As the World Bank warned Monday, if the war between Israel and Hamas widens, conflict in the Middle East could easily set off a steep surge in oil prices. An escalation of the Russian-Ukrainian war could make oil soar as well. So could any number of potential military or political conflicts. If scientific findings dominate, oil could become a stranded asset, one that can’t be sold. But the market consensus is that the viable life of Big Oil has a long way to go. Confounding Choices What are we to make of the messages the market is sending? For one thing, I wouldn’t view them as inevitable. Prices shift every minute, and despite its vaunted reputation, the stock market doesn’t provide a guide to the future. Sometimes it can’t see what’s right in front of it, and it certainly can’t see around corners. I remain hopeful, despite discouraging tidings from the stock market. But I wouldn’t dismiss the stock market’s signals entirely. Market prices incorporate the views of an awful lot of people who can’t agree on much, except, at a particular moment, on the appropriate price for a specific offering. In that sense, the market is, as Graham said, a voting machine. Pouring money into unprofitable ventures isn’t a good strategy unless those ventures ultimately generate a great deal of cash. The jury is still out on many alternative energy companies, much as the world needs their products. Oil companies, on the other hand, are prized for their ability to gush cash. But if you’re seeking a guide to the future, don’t count on the stock market. I expect it to rise over the long run, and to make fickle and foolish choices along the way.

It’s the way she starts most days on her 3,000-acre Texas ranch: ensuring all the cattle are safe, deciding when they should move to another pasture, and checking that the grass is as healthy as her animals. “We’re looking for the sweet spot where the land and cattle help each other,” Ellis says as she rumbles down a narrow dirt road to check on another herd. “You want to find that balance.” Much of Ellis’ work evolved from the ranching her father practiced for decades. Her parents built this ranch, and it’s where Ellis was raised, roaming with her brother through pastures, creeks and hardwood forests as the family added land and cattle over the years. Now it’s Ellis’ turn to make the decisions. She’s implemented changes her father couldn’t dream of — because for her and other ranchers, their livelihoods and the future of the planet are on the line. For generations, beef has been a way of life in Texas, the most quintessential of American main courses, and a premium protein around the world. It’s also the single most damagingfoodfor the planet. Beef is the largest agricultural source of greenhouse gasses worldwide, and it has a bigger carbon footprint than any other type of protein. Climate scientists say the answer is simple: Eat less beef and raise fewer cattle. But even with the wide availability of plant protein and the popularity of initiatives like Meatless Monday, most people around the world are consuming more beef, not less. And as the population grows and more people move into the middle class, demand is only expected to grow. ___ EDITORS’ NOTE — This story is part of The Protein Problem, an AP series that examines the question: Can we feed this growing world without starving the planet? To see the full project, visit https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/the-protein-problem/index.html ___ Ellis finds herself at ground zero. Texas has by far the most cattle in the U.S., which is the biggest producer of beef in the world. Here, beef has long been a staple of Americana, from cowboy Westerns and cattle drives to barbecue joints and meat judging contests. And it’s here that Ellis believes she can make a difference. “I don’t want to do this if it isn’t good for theenvironment,” Ellis said. “I want ranching to be part of the climate solution.” Researchers and a growing number of ranchers agree — they believe there are solutions that address climate change and fill demand, for a world in which people can buy, cook and eat beef with a clear conscience. They point to efforts to change how cattle are raised to retain more carbon in the ground, to develop feed supplements that reduce gas releases, and to make genetic breakthroughs so animals digest their food without brewing up harmful gases. For Ellis, the solution lies in the practice of regenerative ranching. In theory, it’s a holistic way to look at the earth, animals, and water — and how they all interact. In practice, it’s an exhausting, never-ending process of moving her cattle to different pastures in an effort to restore the soil. “What I’m looking to do is make a major impact and completely redefine the beef industry,” Ellis, 41, said. “I want to take everyone with me.” Ellis took over the family ranch, north of Dallas, in 2013. She’s faced all the critical questions surrounding the beef industry: How can ranchers keep up with inflation? How can producers wrestle back some control in an industry dominated by multinational slaughterhouse companies? Should herd numbers be reduced amid long-term drought? But no issue has been more important than beef’s contribution to climate change. Cattle belch out serious amounts of greenhouse gases, especially methane — about 220 pounds a year of methane, which is 80 times more harmful than carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas spewed out by cars. Cattle do it by bathing their swallowed food in about 40 gallons of liquid teeming with microbes. Those little bugs create the energy that feed cattle, but they also ferment the food, brewing up lots of methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide that cows release. Cows are classified as ruminant mammals, which means they regurgitate, chew and rechew the cud until it can be properly digested. Once broken down, another chamber of the stomach, the omasum, filters out everything but water and the finest food particles. When food reaches the final stomach of the cow, the abomasum, the digestion system starts to look very similar to that of other animals, where acids further break down food and allow for the absorption of nutrients. It’s the same with all ruminant animals, from wild deer to domesticated goats and sheep. Cattle get more attention because there are so many of them — 90 million in the U.S. — and because their size means a lot of gas. Most cattle are fed grain — largely corn — in their final months of life, in feedlots. Growing that grain also produces greenhouse gases, from diesel burned in farm equipment and fertilizer sprayed on fields. Overall, beef production creates enough carbon that cutting herd sizes by even 10% to 20% could make a difference, experts agree. They also agree that reducing consumption, particularly in America, is a clear place to start. Americans eat the equivalent of about three hamburgers a week, research shows, and if they cut that in half and instead export U.S. beef to other countries, the world would have a greater chance of meeting demand without cutting forests and expanding cattle grazing lands. That’s because the U.S. beef industry is much more efficient than that of most other countries, thanks to higher-quality feed, better animal genetics and use of feedlots. The U.S. produces 18% of the world’s beef with about 6% of its cattle. For Ellis, regenerative ranching is not only the most efficient but the most environmentally responsible route. Growing up in the tiny community of Rosston, Ellis dreamed of moving to a big city, far from Texas. After high school, she studied landscape architecture at the University of New Mexico, but little by little, her dreams changed. The more she learned about land use and design, the more she wanted to preserve and improve her family’s land. “It dawned on me just how very special this land was,” she said, “and I realized the importance of coming home and continuing for all of us.” That thinking eventually led her to the theories of regenerative ranching, which harken back to the 30 million bison that once thundered through the Plains states. Herds would seemingly annihilate grasslands by eating all the vegetation and pummeling the ground with their hoofs. The ground looked trashed, but those hoofs stimulated the soil, and the animals coated the ground with nitrogen-rich waste. Then, the animals left for months or even years, allowing grasses to grow and establish deep, sturdy roots. Regenerative ranchers try to do roughly the same by moving cattle frequently. They’re kept in spaces where they can trample the grass and soil and then move on, allowing the land to recover for weeks or months. The goal is to produce more grass that will generate deep roots to take carbon from the air and permanently store it underground. For Ellis, regenerative ranching means moving her family’s herd of 320 cows, calves and heifers plus several bulls through 58 fenced pastures. Ellis and her ranch manager further subdivide those pastures using temporary, electrified line they can quickly string to confine cattle in even smaller areas. In daily checks, they examine not only the animals but the grass. By building it to be resilient and hardy, Ellis wants not only to store more carbon but to reduce the need for hay or other feed that use up more land. “It’s a state of symbiosis to where the cattle benefit from the land and the land benefit from the cattle,” said Ellis, whose family in years past left cattle for much longer periods on far larger pastures. In most ranches, that’s still how it’s done. Thousands of ranchers are incorporating regenerative practices but only a small percentage have completely transformed their operations because they don’t think it’s necessary or aren’t able to devote the time, labor and land to such an effort. Ellis has opened her ranch to researchers from the nonprofit Ecosystem Services Market Consortium for readings from hundreds of sites. So far, their study shows Ellis’ work is making a difference: Each year the ranch is sequestering about 2,500 tons of atmospheric carbon dioxide — equivalent to the annual emissions from about 500 cars. And that number has inched up as Ellis makes more changes at the ranch. Randy Jackson, an agronomy professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, cites efforts like Ellis’ and argues the U.S. needs more cattle grazing, not less: “Well-managed grazing on perennial grasslands is our best and maybe our only hope of helping to mitigate climate change.” Even as ranchers like Ellis push ahead with their practices, other efforts are gaining traction to mitigate ranching’s effect on climate, with some of the most promising work revolving around genetics. At Scotland’s Rural College, animal genetics professor Rainer Roehe has used breeding based on genetic traits to reduce methane emissions in cattle by 17% for each generation, with those traits passing on to future offspring and cutting methane emissions by 50% over 10 years. Genetics professor Ann Staiger at Texas A&M University, Kingsville, also is exploring cattle genetics with help from a $4.7 million federal grant in hopes of determining which breeds produce less greenhouse gases. “Greenhouse gas emissions are highly correlated with feed intake, so if we can find the cattle that have lower feed intake, we’ll also measure their greenhouse gas emissions and hopefully see that tie,” Staiger said. New Zealand has been especially aggressive in seeking ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As the government pursues plans to tax farmers for their animals’ methane emissions, researchers are studying everything from genetics to vaccines and supplements. And at the University of California-Davis and Colorado State University, research centers on supplements that can be fed to dairy cows and beef cattle on feedlots, where most U.S. cattle spend their final four to six months before slaughter. Feedlots can be ugly, with manure runoff and animals standing on packed dirt with little shade. But they have advantages: Steady feed enables cattle to put on weight more quickly, and the less time a cow lives, the less greenhouse gases produced. The Colorado State effort, led by a new group called AgNext, hopes to reduce those gases further and delve into other sustainability issues with its testing of cattle supplements at a small feedlot built near its main Fort Collins campus. AgNext is partially funded with money from the beef industry; researchers say they have limited federal funds and want to work closely with producers to implement findings. At AgNext, the methane, carbon and other gases that cattle breathe out are measured in feeders called green bins, and other equipment keeps track of how much they eat and weigh. It’s all an effort to take out the guesswork and analyze how cattle respond to the experimental feeds, or supplements. AgNext is headed by Kim Stackhouse-Lawson, a professor of animal science whose livestock fascination dates to age 6, when she met her first sheep at a Northern California fair. By high school, she was raising a flock of 400. Now, she wants to lead AgNext and the industry to quick, dramatic improvements. “It was what was needed,” she said of AgNext. “A new way to think about partnering a university with a supply chain, and a new group of people to focus just on innovation, to really transform the way we raise animals.” On an icy March morning, that innovation starts just after dawn with 21-year-old graduate student Maya Swenson. She oversees one of the first projects at AgNext, and she’ll get plenty warm tearing open and lifting 50-pound bags of minerals and supplements, then blending a “cattle casserole” to be mixed in a truck with tons of grass feed. Alfalfa pellets act as a treat to attract cattle to the green bins and then keep them eating while gas emissions are measured. The cows — backs covered in snow, breath creating white clouds in the cold air — are important to Swenson, who hopes to bring more sustainable practices to the industry. “I want to be on that side of: How we are taking what we’ve learned and giving it to producers so they can improve their operations?” she said. Ellis has seen how global warming is altering her land. She calls it an “existential crisis,” the backdrop to the endless to-do list that comes with regenerative ranching. After a long day, she likes to take a moment to remember why she does it. Standing with her 6-year-old son on a cool evening, they watch over a gate as dozens of cows graze amid the lush grass and a setting sun. “I could stand here all evening,” she says. Ellis knows she could make more money selling in a niche market. Others in Texas’ regenerative ranching circles have taken to social media to promote their cattle to people who don’t know the difference between a heifer and a Holstein. It can be lucrative, leading to consulting deals and top-tier prices for cows sold directly to consumers. Ellis could find customers, with one of the nation’s largest metro areas only an hour’s drive away. Plenty of people would pay for beef raised on a ranch like hers — with more than 500 species of plants and animals, and clear streams and shady groves that shelter her cattle from the Texas heat. But Ellis has other plans. She’s taken a leadership role in a group that wants to see industry-wide change, with animal welfare and land sustainability practices eventually leading to higher prices for ranchers who adapt. She also knows she could make millions selling her land for development into a subdivision of tidy suburban homes — it’s already happening a few miles down the road. But she can’t bring herself to do it. She figures that keeping the land as a ranch and doubling down on her efforts represent a multimillion-dollar investment in the future of the planet. “That is the most important thing I could possibly do with my life,” Ellis said. “At the end of the day, no amount of money or anything could persuade me to do otherwise.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Methane should be front and centre in the discussions taking place at COP28. As highlighted in our recent Horizons report, it’s a key greenhouse gas, with 28 times the global warming power of carbon dioxide in the 100-year horizon. Last year, COP27 saw action on methane abatement gather some momentum. Only five additional countries signed up to the Global Methane Pledge (GMP) – which aims to reduce global methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by the end of the decade- – during the conference. But this took the total number of country endorsements to 150, up from around 100 after COP26. While the EU recently agreed a deal on its first-ever methane-reduction law, elsewhere there has been little progress by countries to convert pledges into legislation. Political resistance and industry push-back has hampered some jurisdictions that have introduced methane regulations. However, we expect to see steps taken towards binding agreements at COP28. Here’s why: 1. The foundations have been laid for China-US to announce breakthrough on new climate agreement China published its long-awaited methane reduction plan earlier this month, paving the way for a new climate agreement between the world’s two largest greenhouse gas emitters. While China’s methane action plan was short on firm targets, it has formed a key part of China-US climate negotiations ahead of COP28. As the culmination of months of talks, the methane plan points to renewed cooperation on climate targets between the two economic giants, which could produce something more concrete at the upcoming summit. So what? Responsible for over a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, China and the US have the ability to lead the global energy transition. Breakthroughs in China-US alignment have a habit of rippling out into other major international agreements. An Obama-Xi summit in 2014 led to China’s first emissions cap pledge, and laid the foundations for the Paris agreement the following year. 2. India will come under increasing pressure to sign up to the GMP India was one of the highest-profile countries to decline signing up to the GMP at the previous two COPs. And it doesn’t look like signing up this time around either. India cited the impact to its agricultural economy as one of the reasons not to sign up to the GMP at COP27 last year. Officials have recently pointed to various domestic methane reduction measures as further reason to stay outside the international pact. However, external pressure is sure to mount after China’s recent methane-action announcement, especially if more concrete international action comes from it. Moreover, countries such as Brazil, with similarly important agricultural sectors in terms of their impact on the economy and methane emissions, is a GMP signatory, and included methane emissions in its recently-updated NDC. India’s reluctance to sign up will be increasingly tested over the medium term. So what? India is the second largest global methane emitter and has a rapidly growing population and economy. Abating methane emissions early will not only be crucial for the country to hit Paris-aligned goals, but also for the wider global energy transition. External pressure to sign up to the GMP may soon become too much to resist. 3. Companies could be about to take the lead in new abatement commitments COP28, presided over by the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, will be more receptive to the fossil-fuel industry’s attendance than previous COPs. Oil and gas companies will be 'in the room' and likely to participate actively. The positive side to having higher energy industry participation could be that companies take the lead from nation states in methane reduction action. COP President Dr. Sultan Al Jaber has already hinted that more than 20 oil and gas firms have signalled intent to zero out methane emissions and eliminate routine flaring by the end of the decade, with an announcement likely during the upcoming Summit. So what? The energy sector contributes more than a third of all anthropogenic, or human-caused, methane emissions, with big cuts possible if investment is correctly applied. This could prompt governments to follow through with abatement legislation at the national level. Conclusion: gathering momentum on methane  There is gathering momentum around the methane abatement movement which could culminate in definite, targeted and ratified action. It could also galvanise support for upcoming policies such as the US Inflation Reduction Act’s waste emissions charge and the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) methane reduction plan.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese made the announcement on Friday at the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders' Meeting in the Cook Islands. Under a pact signed by the two nations, Australia committed to providing assistance to Tuvalu“in response to a major natural disaster, health pandemics and military aggression,”and to establish a“dedicated intake”granting permanent residency to Tuvaluans in Australia. An initial cap will be set at 280 people per year. Albanese called the move“groundbreaking”and“the most significant agreement between Australia and a Pacific island nation ever.” Tuvalu is a small nation made up of nine low-lying islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean between Australia and Hawaii. It has a total area of 26 square kilometers and a population of 11,426. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), half of the capital, Funafuti, is expected to be flooded by tidal waters by 2050. Two years ago, a video of Tuvalu's former foreign minister Simon Kofe standing knee-deep in the ocean to highlight the climate crisis went viral. A year later, he said Tuvalu plans to create a digital version of itself to preserve its history and culture. Acknowledging that climate change remains“the greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and well-being of people in the Pacific,”Albanese’s office said Australia will make additional investments to“build the resilience of our Pacific partners.” Canberra will commit at least $350 million to climate infrastructure in the region, including $75 million for a program to develop renewable energy in remote and rural areas. At a press conference after the meeting, Albanese said Australia was also“open to approaches from other countries on how we can enhance our partnerships”with Pacific nations.",-1.0,0.0

During third quarter we see solid development in Denmark as well as international, in line with the continued implementation of our strategic initiatives. Focusing on F2 Climate Software, developing the F2-for-Partners concept, as well as now offering Artificial Intelligence (AI) for government as a fully integrated part of the F2 standard software. Environmental permitting is a key global challenge, for government as well as industries, in the need for meeting climate objectives and new energy sources. By extending the F2 Climate Software for permitting with AI functionality, cBrain is taking a lead as supplier of government solutions within this field. Solid organic growth based on a strong value proposition With the F2 digital platform, cBrain offers government organizations the opportunity to digitize based on standard software instead of traditional custom-built solutions. The adoption of standard software represents a disruptive and game-changing approach, as it offers government entities substantial business benefits through cost reductions, faster delivery, and accelerated digital transformation. cBrain thereby challenges one of the largest global industries, referred to as government digitization, and faces a significant business opportunity. cBrain capitalizes this opportunity by executing an ambitious international growth plan. Extending the long-term growth plan, cBrain added specific areas of focus for the period 2023-2025. This includes investing in ""F2 Climate Software,"" which serves as a door opener and accelerator for export and investing in the ""F2-for-Partners"" concept, which allows cBrain to further scale its business. The growth plan is based on organic growth, and cBrain delivers solid growth and earnings with a strong positive cash flow. Results show that cBrain is well on track with the 2023-2025 growth plan. In August, full-year revenue growth guidance for 2023 was revised and increased to 20-25%, up from the previous range of 15-20%, and full-year guidance for earnings before tax (EBT) increased to 20-25%, up from the previous range of 18-22%. The third quarter development confirms the revised guidance for the full year. Continued success in Denmark and Germany, while increasing project size cBrain continues to win market shares and develop the business in Denmark, thereby securing the important Danish reference position. In the third quarter, cBrain announced agreements with two more Danish public organizations, The Danish Accreditation Institution, and Innovation Fund Denmark, to implement F2 as their digital platform and join the Danish F2 user group. Both public organizations are sponsored by the Ministry for Higher Education and Science, who has already implemented F2. cBrain delivers still larger and more complex solutions. In September, cBrain successfully delivered an F2 based grants management solution for Danish Energy Agency (“Energistyrelsen”), which supports the administration of grants for heat pumps (“Varmepumpepuljen”). In parallel, this project supports cBrain’s position as a supplier of climate software on the Danish market. New projects in Denmark includes winning a public tender to deliver a new hunting license solution (“Jagttegn”) for the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (“Miljøstyrelsen”). In Germany, cBrain continues to develop its business with Deutsche Rentenversicherung and initiating new projects across the organization. Increasing size of projects is important to cBrain. It demonstrates that also for large and still more complex digital transformation projects, government organizations now begin to adapt standard software as an alternative to custom-built solutions. F2 Climate software is an international door opener The fight against climate change and global warming is driven and funded by governments. However, the reality is that it often takes years to execute political decisions due to bureaucratic delays, fueled by the lack of digitization and inefficient IT systems. In close collaboration with the Danish government organizations cBrain has developed a category of F2 based solutions, called F2 Climate Software, that helps closing the time gap between political decision and bureaucratic execution. F2 Climate Software is standard software, based on reusable open-source configuration and best practices, which has been developed in close collaboration with the Danish government. F2 Climate Software can be reused across the world, and thereby serves as an international door opener for cBrain. In third quarter new climate software initiatives include new projects in Kenya, establishing cBrain India, increased focus on environmental permitting, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). cBrain has initiated a number of new projects in Kenya During third quarter, cBrain signed its first project with the National Environmental Management Authority of Kenya (NEMA). cBrain is configuring and delivering an F2 based environmental inspection solution, which manages environmental auditing. Following the first project, cBrain has just signed an agreement to deliver a solution for NEMA that supports company registration related to extended producer responsibility (EPR). In parallel, cBrain has signed an agreement to develop a solution for the Kenya Diary board. Kenya Dairy Board is a state corporation under the Ministry of Agriculture & Livestock Development. The solution will help to support quality inspections related to milk production. cBrain has established cBrain India in the state of Tamil Nadu Under the guidance of the Green Strategic Partnership between India and Denmark, cBrain signed a partnership agreement with Kodumburar Solutions in India and established cBrain India located in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. With more than 75 million citizens, Tamil Nadu is the sixth largest state by population in India. The government of Tamil Nadu has a strong focus on both government digitization and climate action. Tamil Nadu thereby offers a sweet spot for initiating the reuse of Danish government experiences and software in India. With a strong focus on climate solutions and working with a partner, the joint venture is directly aligned with the F2 Climate Software and F2-for-Partners strategic initiatives. The partnership has been formed over a longer period, including meetings with the government in Tamil Nadu as well as hosting meetings and government visits from Tamil Nadu in Denmark. Kodumburar Solutions has in-depth understanding of Indian government practices. Based on the partnership, Kodumburar Solutions and cBrain intend to offer the F2 digital platform and Danish government best practices, including F2 Climate Software, to accelerate fast government digital transformation as well as climate action initiatives in India. Working with partners allows cBrain to scale internationally A key element of the cBrain growth plan is the “F2-for-Partners” concept, which enables a new generation of government digital transformation partners. Today most government organizations are served by a huge industry of IT system integrators and consulting firms. While this industry continues to deliver rigid legacy solutions based on custom-built solutions and software components, governments struggle to convert ambitious digitization plans into deliverables and measurable results. By leveraging standard software, a large portion of the IT-related work is eliminated. This frees up time and resources, and it empowers government organizations and their digital transformation partners to prioritize process innovation and organizational enhancements, while successfully transforming and meeting their strategic business goals. This is essential to the F2-for-Partner concept. The F2-for-Partner concept allows government themselves and/or external consulting partners to manage the configuration and implementation of F2, while eliminating a major part of the IT work. The F2-for-Partner concept thereby enables a new generation of government digital transformation partners, who focus on delivering real digital transformation effects instead of a lot of IT work. A key enabler for government and/or their partners to manage the configuration and implementation of F2, is the F2 Service Builder product. cBrain announced the F2 Service Builder during the spring, and the first version of the product is now being used by customers. F2 Service Builder allows users to digitize workflows simply by filling out a spreadsheet The F2 Service Builder provides a unique and efficient approach for government organizations seeking to digitize a large number of processes at a high speed. With the F2 Service Builder business users and process consultants can very easily digitize workflows by filling out a spreadsheet. This includes the definition of end-to-end workflows, encompassing self-service, case processing, filing, and even data extracts and dashboards for controlling and management reporting. It may still take time to understand and design a government process, but with the F2 Service Builder, the IT work involved is significantly reduced or almost eliminated, allowing for the rapid setup of well-functioning processes, sometimes just within a few hours. Additionally, process definitions can be easily reused by copying an existing process, revising the copied sheet, and uploading it as a new process. cBrain is happy to notice that the F2 Service Builder has gained considerable attention among customers. During the third quarter, several customers have been introduced, and while building a community of F2 Service Builder customers, cBrain is now further developing F2 Service Builder product. F2 Service Builder is a unique tool for both customers and partners By allowing organizations to develop and reuse smart processes, the F2 Service Builder becomes an extremely efficient tool for implementing best practices and driving standardization throughout the organization. This makes the F2 Service Builder a unique tool for external partners who offer large-scale digital transformation to government organizations. With this tool, consulting partners specializing in process optimization and automation can deliver fast and agile digital transformation solutions. Thanks to its flexibility, the process sheets can easily be modified to align with future changes in processes or organizational structures. This enables external consulting partners to offer government customers a truly agile approach, focusing on step-by-step process innovation and organizational development. Concurrently, they can build and provide pre-configured process libraries for their government customers, based on well-established best practices. As a result, cBrain expects the F2 Service Builder to become a pivotal tool within the F2 ecosystem of partners. Through close collaboration with customers and partners, cBrain continuously enhances the functionality of the F2 Service Builder. In August cBrain announced AI for Government cBrain expects that artificial intelligence will dramatically increase productivity and quality of government work. During spring cBrain further developed F2 to offer artificial intelligence (AI) functionality, tailor-made for government usage and seamlessly integrated with F2. Furthermore, cBrain has developed and prepared a sandbox approach which allows individual government organizations to learn and explore AI usage. In parallel the sandbox approach enables government organizations to inspire and learn from each other. Due to the unique F2 architecture, cBrain can offer AI functionality for government, which is difficult to achieve with today's well-known general-purpose AI services. This includes addressing compliance restrictions, as well as in-depth learning based on customer data, which will allow F2 to support customer specific case processing. First customers now use sandboxes as a secure learning environment A sandbox is a research-based initiative, that offers a secure environment for simulating live government work and case processing. The sandbox allows individual government authorities to investigate and test specific use cases, while using their own case type specific data. This is possible, as cBrain can offer AI on premise, thereby eliminating many of the issues related to compliance and the use of person related data. The F2 based AI sandbox approach is ready for customers, and in the third quarter cBrain signed the two first agreements with customers. This includes a Danish ministerial department and a large Danish government agency, who will pilot AI functionality aligned with their individual needs. Accelerating government environmental permitting by use of AI cBrain is currently initiating several new F2 based AI initiatives. This includes the development of a digital platform supporting environmental permitting, fully integrated with AI. While government permitting is a crucial aspect of ensuring the safety, environmental compliance, and orderly development of energy projects, it is also complex and time-consuming, thereby making government permitting a major source of delay in the transition towards new energy sources. The Danish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), ""Miljøstyrelsen"", is responsible for environmental protection and regulation in Denmark. Striking a balance between regulatory thoroughness and agility is essential for ensuring a timely and successful energy transition. Therefore, the Danish EPA has initiated an ambitious digital transformation project to expedite government permitting. Working in close collaboration with the Danish EPA cBrain has as a first step configured an F2 based solution which supports environmental permitting. This solution has been delivered and is in production. As next step, historic data from the Danish EPA is now being used as basis for training and adding AI functions for the permitting solutions, which fully integrated with case processing, supports, and accelerates the permitting process. Sharing permitting experiences internationally In close collaboration which the Danish EPA, cBrain has developed leading edge solutions to support and accelerate government environmental permitting. As environmental permitting is a global challenge, these solutions gain interest from governments across the world. In October, cBrain was invited by the White House Council on Environmental Quality to participate in the Environmental Permitting Technology and Data Summit in Washington. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) within the Executive Office of the President of the United States coordinates the federal government’s efforts to improve, preserve, and protect America’s public health and environment. This included presenting Danish EPA solutions at the summit, as well as a dedicated evening event at the Danish Embassy in Washington, discussing permitting reform initiatives with key federal stakeholders and how digital technologies can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of federal infrastructure permitting processes. In December, cBrain participates as part of the Danish delegation at the COP28 in Dubai. cBrain is preparing to share experiences and climate software solutions with a special focus on environmental permitting. This includes participation in a number of sessions and panel debates at the COP28.

The study is an update of a 2019 analysis that 15,000 scientists across the globe had supported and stated that 20 of 35 crucial indicators used to track anthropogenic climate change are at record highs. “Without actions that address the root problem of humanity taking more from Earth than it can safely give, we’re on our way to the potential collapse of natural and socioeconomic systems and a world with unbearable heat and shortages of food,”said Dr. Christopher Wolf of Oregon State University (OSU), the lead author of the report. In addition to surging greenhouse gas emissions, the study found that rising global temperatures and sea levels are key indicators of the Earth’s ill health. Other factors also include high human and livestock population levels. The researchers’ findings echo a separate report released last month, which concluded that Earth is“well outside the safe operating space for humanity.” Researchers said the latest study comes during a year in which several climate records were smashed, including global air temperatures, ocean temperatures, and ice levels in the Southern Ocean. In July, scientists recorded the highest monthly air surface temperature ever registered – likely the hottest the planet has experienced in 100,000 years. “By 2100, as many as 3 to 6 billion people may find themselves outside Earth’s liveable regions,”Dr. Wolf explained, adding that increasingly large numbers of people“will be encountering severe heat, limited food availability, and elevated mortality rates.” The report also states that“for several decades,”the scientific community has been sounding the alarm about humanity’s impact on worsening climate conditions.“Unfortunately, time is up,”it says. The scientists also highlighted severe flooding in China and India, as well as a powerful Mediterranean storm that led to the deaths of thousands of people in Libya, as further examples of deteriorating climate conditions. As for potential actions to mitigate the worsening effects of climate change, the paper calls for removing fossil fuel subsidies, increasing forest protection, and moving towards a more plant-based diet for wealthy individuals. It also calls for phasing out oil and gas and gradually reducing the human population via family planning. “Life on our planet is clearly under siege,”concluded Prof. William Ripple, also of OSU.“It is a moral duty of scientists and our institutions to alert humanity of any potential existential threat and to show leadership is taking action.”",-1.0,-1.0

Last month’s average temperature was 0.93 degrees Celsius (1.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 1991-2020 average for September. That's the warmest margin above average for a month in 83 years of records kept by the European Space Agency’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. “It’s just mind-blowing really,” said Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo. “Never seen anything like that in any month in our records.” While July and August had hotter raw temperatures because they are warmer months on the calendar, September had what scientists call the biggest anomaly, or departure from normal. Temperature anomalies are crucial pieces of data in a warming world. “This is not a fancy weather statistic,” Imperial College of London climate scientist Friederike Otto said in an email. “It’s a death sentence for people and ecosystems. It destroys assets, infrastructure, harvest.” Read more:Extreme Heat Is Endangering America's Workers—and Its Economy Copernicus calculated that the average temperature for September was 16.38 degrees Celsius (61.48 degrees Fahrenheit), which broke the old record set in September 2020 by a whopping half-degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit). That's a huge margin in climate records. Thehot temperaturesstretched across the globe but they were chiefly driven by persistent and unusual warmth in the world’s oceans, which didn’t cool off as much in September as normal and have been record hot since spring, said Buontempo. Earth is on track for its hottest year on record, about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Samantha Burgess, Copernicus’ deputy director. This past September was 1.75 degrees Celsius (3.15 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the mid-1800s, Copernicus reported. The world agreed in 2015 to try to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming since pre-industrial times. The global threshold goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius is for long-term temperature averages, not a single month or year. But scientists still expressed grave concern at the records being set. “What we’re seeing right now is the backdrop of rapid global warming at a pace that the Earth has not seen in eons coupled with El Nino, natural climate cycle” that’s a temporary warming of parts of the Pacific Ocean that changes weather worldwide, said U.S. climate scientist Jessica Moerman, who is also president of the Evangelical Environmental Network. “This double whammy together is where things get dangerous.” Though El Nino is playing a part, climate change has a bigger footprint in this warmth, Buontempo said. “There really is no end in sight given new oil and gas reserves are still being opened for exploitation,” Otto said. “If you have more record hot events, there is no respite for humans and nature, no time to recover."" Buontempo said El Nino is likely to get warmer and cause even higher temperatures next year. “This month was, in my professional opinion as a climate scientist – absolutely gobsmackingly bananas,” climate scientist Zeke Hausfathersaid on X, formerly known as Twitter.",-1.0,-1.0

Particles come partly from natural sources such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires, and partly from pollution and emissions. Aerosol researcher Johan Friberg studies particles at high altitudes. He fears that the global increase in forest fires could have a significant impact on the ozone layer.""I study the air in the stratosphere and the upper part of the troposphere. I want to try and explain variations in the prevalence of aerosol particles, and I have recently become interested in the stratospheric zone"" explains Johan Friberg, researcher at MERGE (ModElling the Regional and Global Earth system) at Lund University.The troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere, and it contains three quarters of the atmosphere's total mass, including almost allwater vaporand aerosol particles. In the troposphere, our various weather systems are formed. Above that, at 15–50 kilometers above sea level, we have the stratosphere, which includes the ozone layer that, among other things, protects Earth fromultraviolet radiation(UV radiation).What role do particles play in the atmosphere?Aerosol particles can both spread and absorb sunlight, which can have cooling or warming effects on the climate. They also affectcloud formationsince water does not condense by itself, it needs particles in order to form cloud droplets. That, in turn, affects the Earth's radiation balance.In lower layers of air in the troposphere, clouds form around particles, which means that they soon fall as precipitation. That does not happen in the stratosphere, where no precipitation forms. Instead, the particles follow air currents and can be spread globally within that layer.""In the stratosphere, the aerosol particles affect the ozone, causing it to break down and making the protective layer thinner. This was plain to see after the largest volcanic eruption in the modern age, from Pinatubo in 1991. The eruption emitted millions of tons of particles into the stratosphere, where they remained for several years,"" Johan Friberg explains.Humans create freonsThe hole in thestratospheric ozoneis caused by freons being activated into ozone-depleting substances. Freons are synthetic substances that we have created. They do not occur naturally, but human emissions of freons have caused them to spread all over the stratosphere. Large ozone holes form over Antarctica because the stratosphere over the polar region is very cold in winter.A type of cloud called mother of pearl forms there. These clouds containice crystals, and on the surface of the crystals the freon activation happens much faster than it does in the air.""Like mother of pearl clouds, particles fromforest firesandvolcanic eruptionscan activate freons. They can also affect the number of ice crystals in the cloud and therefore ozone depletion. The combination of these two factors leads to holes in the ozone layer and more UV radiation reaching us,"" explains Johan Friberg.The effect of forest fires should be studied furtherAfter the Australian fires in 2019 and 2020, the concentration of ozone in the Southern Hemisphere fell and ozone holes formed outside the polar region. If the fires were to occur in the Northern Hemisphere, thedamaging effectsof reduced protection from dangerous UV radiation would have consequences for billions of people, as well as animal and plant life, including vital agricultural production.For the most part, existing research data comes from satellites and is suitable for studying the recent past, but from the large volcanic eruption of 1991 and further back, there is not much data available.Johan Friberg wants to research further back in time and in greater detail, to be sure of what effects the increasing number of forest fires globally might have. There are several reasons why forest fires occur, but we see an increase both because of climate change and causes that are linked to modern forestry methods.""There are still many unanswered questions and more to explore at a detailed level,"" Johan Friberg argues. ""We do not know how much previous forest fires have affected theozone layer, which is why more research is needed.""Provided byLund UniversityCitation:

They think that more insects can change their growth rate, which could help them adjust to climate change. The study has beenpublishedinNature Ecology & Evolution.Flourbeetleswith a particular genomic deletion can grow faster than those without this mutation. Growing fast is useful when food is scarce and the beetles have to mature quickly to fly to find food. But there are drawbacks to this faster development. The fast-growingflourbeetles are smaller and lay fewer eggs. In stable conditions with plenty of food, it is better for the beetles to grow that bit slower so they can become larger and lay more eggs.What causes the faster growth?The biologists studied how some flour beetles develop faster than others. They found that the faster-growing beetles had a deletion in a piece of the genome that regulates the expression of the enzyme CYP18a1. This enzyme is involved in breaking down the hormone ecdysone, which is important to all kinds of developmental transitions, such as from molt to the next larval stage and pupation.The change in CYP18a1 means ecdysone break downs somewhat slower, which in turn causes a rapid hormone peak. All the flour beetle's developmental stages are faster as a result.What is unique about the study is that thebiologistsknow for sure that the deletion that affects the enzyme CYP18a1 causes the faster growth and that no other genetic variations in the flour beetles are responsible. By using the CRISPR/CAS9 technique, they were able to recreate the deletion in half of a genetically identical population. Theflour beetleswith the deletion grew faster in the lab than those without the change in theenzyme.Adapting to climate changeIf trees, plants and flowers to flower earlier or later because ofclimate change, insects will have to adapt to survive. ""There is clearly a huge selection pressure on insects to change their developmental time,"" says Maurijn van der Zee, who was involved in the research. ""Our research can help see which other insects can adjust their developmental speed by growing faster or slower. Then we may be able to figure out which insects we need to worry about and which ones we don't.""Van der Zee finds it reassuring that insects can quickly adapt their developmental rate to changing conditions. But it's not all good news. ""It also changes other things, like the size of theinsectsand how many eggs they lay, and maybe more that we are not yet aware of.""",1.0,1.0

It was created by federal laws from 1953 to promoteenvironmental protectionand development in the area.The article advocates wildlife and conservation management strategies to mitigate the negative effects of poaching. These include combating local consumption of sensitive species such as tapirs, peccaries and curassows, and the sale of bushmeat inurban areas, mainly in the vicinity of cities and upland forest areas where fish and other aquatic protein sources are scarce or non-existent.The study described in the article was part of the Ph.D. research of Ricardo Sampaio, an environmental analyst at the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), an arm of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change.The authors show that the abundance of local game species begins to fall about 5 kilometers away from the nearest human community. In ecology, local abundance means the number of individuals of a species in a particular ecosystem.The researchers deployed 720camera trapsnear 100local communitiesinside and outside nine areas of central and southwestern Amazonia; five are Extraction Reserves (RESEX), two are Sustainable Development Reserves (RDS) and two are state-run forests.The camera traps recorded the presence of 29 bird and mammal species weighing more than 5 kg, including pacas, tapirs, curassows and guans. In areas where the community engages in or has access to sustainable fish farming, as in the case of the arapaima or pirarucu in the Middle Purus and Juruá River in Amazonas state, the pressure on terrestrial species from subsistence poaching is lower.""The main finding of the study was that the key factor in changes in species diversity, abundance and biomass is distance from human communities. Even so, we observed that human communities have little impact on biodiversity, demystifying certain discussions that question the extent to which sustainable-use conservation units protect biodiversity. Community-based wildlife management can be a way to assure food security while also protecting biodiversity in these areas,"" Sampaio told Agência FAPESP.The article was published just as environmental issues in the Amazon were coming to the fore again in the global debate on sustainable development, not least thanks to theBelém Declaration, which called among other things for measures to increase ""native vegetation stocks by means of financial and non-financial incentives, and other instruments for conservation"".The document was issued on August 8 by eight heads of state representing the signatories of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) at the Amazon Summit in Belém, capital of Pará state.""Practical results like the findings of our research project help create an environment for discussion and institutional processes to address the issue of subsistence poaching, which is a taboo in Brazil. The challenge now is to ensure that governments and agencies are aware of these findings and can translate them into practice,"" Sampaio said.The study involved Ronaldo Gonçalves Morato, former head of ICMBio's National Center for Research and Conservation of Carnivorous Mammals (CENAP). An earlierarticleby Morato and his group showed that distance from urban centers and availability of aquatic protein are the factors that most influence perceptions of the sustainability of game hunting among communities living in conservation units.The other authors of theBiological Conservationarticle are Adriano Garcia Chiarello, a professor at the Biology Department of the University of São Paulo's Ribeirão Preto School of Philosophy, Science and Letters (FFCLRP-USP) in Brazil, and Carlos Augusto Peres, a professor at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom.This year, Peres won an International Champions Award in the inaugural Frontiers Planet Prize, as the lead scientist for one of the most promising recent research articles on sustainability-related topics. His prizewinning paper waspublishedin the journalPNAS.Pressure from poachingAccording to the researchers, the study was one of the largest ever conducted using camera traps to assess the response of vertebrates to poaching in areas of the Amazon, which contains the world's most biodiverse tropical rainforest.They also stressed that although the reduction in numbers of animals is due to pressure from poaching near human communities, the negative impact on the forest from more frequent fires, logging and domestic dogs used to hunt game may also drive away animals in the vicinity of communities. In fact, they found this to be the case for 13 of the species studied.The findings have already had practical results, Sampaio said. When the researchers were doing fieldwork in the Riozinho da Liberdade RESEX (Acre state), the community there was discussing the effectiveness of a local agreement to regulate subsistence hunting, and there were disagreements about whether to allow dogs. They set up camera traps on both banks of the river.Dogs were allowed only on the right bank. They showed the images to the community, proving that on the left bank, where no dogs were allowed, there were more wild animals (which the locals themselves referred to as ""bushmeat"" or ""game"").""The meeting was attended by women and children as well as community leaders. They had lived in the forest all their lives, but many had never before seen certain animals before they saw these images,"" Sampaio recalled.Some months later, he continued, he received the minutes from a meeting where the images were used to support a collective decision not to allow hunting dogs anymore. ""This decision was eventually adopted in the management plan for the conservation unit, which has rules defined by the community.It was one of the positive practical outcomes in terms of local decision-making and biodiversity conservation,"" said Sampaio, who advocates combining scientific knowledge with the traditional knowledge accumulated by river dwellers and Indigenous communities.Brazil's federal legislation onconservation unitsestablishes that extraction reserves are demarcated with the aim of protecting the livelihoods and culture of traditional people, such as river dwellers, Indigenous communities and quilombolas (inhabitants of quilombos, settlements originally formed by enslaved Africans who escaped in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries), and assuring sustainable use of natural resources in the area.These communities may harvest (""extract"") forest produce to earn a living while also practicing subsistence farming with some food crops and small animals. RESEX reserves are government property, and hunting by amateurs or professionals is banned.",0.0,0.0

At the COP28 UN climate talks in November, the bloc will also call for eliminating ""as soon as possible"" subsidies for fossil fuels which do not serve to combat energy poverty or ensure a ""just transition"" -- but without setting a deadline as NGOs hoped. ""(The European) Council stresses that the transition to a climate-neutral economy will require a global phase-out of unabated fossil fuels and a peak in their consumption in this decade"", said a statement released after the meeting of EU environment ministers. At the same time the 27 European nations will advocate ""the importance of having the energy sector predominantly free of fossil fuels well before 2050"", a formula expressed this time without the mention of ""unabated"". EU ministers meeting in Luxembourg bitterly clashed over the inclusion of the word in the negotiating mandate for new EU commissioner for climate matters, Wopke Hoekstra, who will represent them at COP28 in Dubai from November 30 to December 12. Brussels is looking to triple the amount of global renewable energy used by the end of this decade and double energy efficiency in line with the goals of the COP28 presidency. The EU has already set itself a horizon of 2050 to abolish ""unabated"" fossil fuels -- meaning those reliant on coal, oil and gas that do not have mechanisms to capture or store carbon. The issue is expected to be bitterly fought over at the UN climate conference in Dubai, and has been the subject of strained debate between EU countries. Together with NGOs, some governments wanted the ""unabated"" label withdrawn or have strict conditions attached to the use of carbon capture technology, to prevent them being used as justification for continued fossil-fuel burning. ""There's no alternative for driving down emissions across the board,"" Hoekstra said. ""However some sectors are extremely hard to abate"" and thus carbon-capture technology was needed ""as part of the total solution space,"" he said. France's energy transition minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher called such tech ""of interest"" but added that it should be reserved for sectors that were unable otherwise to decarbonise. In the end, the term ""unabated"" was retained in the agreed text but is no longer mentioned in the formulation of the long-term objective of an energy sector predominantly free of fossil fuels ""well before 2050"". In the immediate future, carbon capture technologies ""should be tied to those sectors where it's going to be difficult to engage in decarbonisation, where it's difficult to wean themselves off fossil fuels for some of the industrial process"", explained Spain's ecological transition minister Teresa Ribera, whose country chaired the Luxembourg meeting. ""The long-term objective is that fossil fuels should be phased out of our energy mix as we tried to promote decarbonisation,"" she said. At COP28 many countries will push to secure an unprecedented commitment to move away from ""unabated"" fossil fuels. But a global commitment to eliminating fossil fuels entirely would be ""very complicated"", Hoekstra said. And, when it comes to an accord to be taken up by UN member countries, ""it takes 192 to tango,"" he said. The EU is also calling for ""striving for a fully or predominantly decarbonised global power system in the 2030s"". The bloc also called for global action towards the tripling of installed renewable energy capacity by 2030 as well as a doubling of energy efficiency, in line with the roadmap of the president of COP28. The Europeans also debated whether to maintain in Dubai their legally established objective of a 55 percent reduction in the bloc's greenhouse gases by 2030 or the 57 percent that it should de facto reach under policies already adopted. A 57 percent announcement would reinforce Europe's ambition to be a global leader on combating climate change, said European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic and other officials. In the end, they simply updated their submission to indicate the bloc was aiming to reduce its emissions ""by at least 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels"". ""It was very important that we insisted on the factual effect of what we were doing,"" said Ribera. By its example ""the EU is a driving force for change"", she said. The bloc will also call for strengthening existing funding arrangements evoked in COP27 to compensate poorer countries as they shift to greener energy production and use.",0.0,0.0

And in two weeks, representatives from nearly 200 countries will gather in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, as part of the UN climate talks known as COP28. The deal between the US and China could deliver a jolt of ambition before the global talks. If the world’s two biggest polluting countries can agree to reduce their fossil fuel emissions, other countries should find it easier to follow suit. “This definitely puts wind in the sails heading in to COP,” said New York Times reporter Lisa Friedman, who has covered climate negotiations between the US and China for years. Friedman noted that, in the lead-up to COP21, which took place in Paris in 2015, the US and China agreed on a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, using precise language that recognized that each country would have to move at its own pace. Months later, Friedman said, “that language then ultimately became part of the language of the Paris Agreement,” when world leaders reached a landmark deal to try to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Before Dubai, the fight is already raging. “We’re in a situation where countries are debating how to get out of COP28 with political language that calls on countries to triple renewable energy capacity, double energy efficiency and also whether to call for countries to phase out fossil fuels or unabated fossil fuels,” Friedman said. This year, perhaps as in 2015, a bilateral deal between the US and China may provide a much needed template for negotiations. Not all climate experts are optimistic. This year’s event is being held in the UAE, one of the world’s biggest oil producers. Critics have derided this year’s conference as a farce, where governments under the influence of fossil fuel interests will make nonbinding commitments that are never achieved. Details of the Deal The new climate deal represents a rare point of agreement between the US and China, which are at odds over geopolitics and trade. The countries agreed to “pursue efforts to triple renewable energy capacity globally by 2030,” with the intention “to accelerate the substitution for coal, oil and gas generation.” Both countries anticipate that they will achieve “meaningful absolute power sector emission reduction” this decade. The agreement is short on enforcement mechanisms. But it does push forward on several fronts. Both countries agreed that in their next set of national climate pledges, which are due next year, they would set reduction targets for all greenhouse gas emissions — not just carbon dioxide but also methane, nitrous oxide and other planet-warming gases. China’s willingness to address methane, a step it has long resisted, is particularly notable. While it has agreed in principle to cut methane, it has not previously said it will establish concrete targets. “Methane has been notably absent from China’s previous commitment under the Paris Agreement,” David Waskow, international climate director at the World Resources Institute, said in a statement. “This announcement is a major step because China is the world’s largest methane emitter and serious actions to curb this gas is essential for slowing global warming in the near term.” While the agreement marks the resumption of collaborative work between the world’s two biggest polluters, and sets ambitious new targets and provides momentum going in to COP, it will not be enough to quiet the critics who say the world is still acting too slowly to address climate change. Alden Meyer, a senior associate at E3G, an environmental research organization based in Britain, said the US-China language around displacing fossil fuels was “tortured” and did not clearly commit either country to take decisive action. “It really is silent on the need to phase down oil and gas emissions,” he said. The deal also does not include any promises by China to phase out its use of coal or to stop issuing permits for new coal plants and building them. Scientists say immediately reducing fossil fuel use is essential to avoid further catastrophic warming. “It is disappointing that the two nations said nothing about the need to rapidly transition away from fossil fuels this decade, which will be a central issue at the COP28 summit,” Waskow said.

Our national environmental legislation has largely failed to protect biodiversity, including many threatened plants, animals and ecological communities. But change is afoot.Thefederal governmentisreforming our national environmental law. Following a scathing review in 2021, the legislation is being rewritten. While amendments to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999(EPBC Act)are yet to be tabled in parliament, the government says ""rolling consultation"" has begun.About 30environment, business and industry groupsattended ""targeted stakeholder workshops"" last month. Public consultation begins with two webinars, on November 23 and 28. Government officials are offering to ""explain how the proposed changes are designed to work and how they compare to existing laws."" But they are not sharing the draft legislation yet.How can we assess whether thesenew lawscan prevent further species loss andhabitat destruction? Here's an essential checklist of five things the law must include if we are to avoid calamity and hasten environmental recovery.1. A climate triggerThe EPBC Act does not explicitly discuss and account for climate change and its impacts. So the federal environment minister is not legally bound to consider—or authorized to refuse—new or expanded coal mines and fossil gas fields based on their future climate impacts.But climate change clearlythreatens biodiversityand special places such as the Great Barrier Reef, as well ashuman communities and culture.2. Habitat means homes for wildlifeProtection of sufficient and connected habitat must be central to Australia's national environmental law. If homes forswift parrots, koalas, greater gliders and otherthreatened speciescontinue to be destroyedand fragmented, it is all but guaranteed Australia will fail in its stated quest to avoid further extinctions.Northern Australia is home to exceptional but decliningbiodiversitythat is increasinglythreatenedby development of pastoral, cotton and fracking industries.Significant increases inland clearingandwater extractionare seldom referred under the EPBC Act, let alone assessed.Environmental law reform must stem the accelerating loss of biodiversity in this region and elsewhere. Reforms must includeexpanding the water trigger to apply to shale gas fracking, and ensuring significantland clearingis referred and assessed.It is also crucial that federal approval powers are notdevolved to states and territories, particularly in remote regions where so much damage occursout of sight and out of mind.3. Setting clear objectives and measuring outcomesThe new laws must state policy objectives such asno new extinctionsand no actions that accelerate climate change.Decision-makers must be required to address direct, indirect and cumulative threats that undermine these objectives.The newNational Environment Standards(the centerpiece of this law reform) must stipulate red lines not to be crossed, such as no clearing of any critically endangered ecological communities or critical habitat of threatened species.We should always seek first to avoid harm, then keep harm to a minimum, andonly as a last resort, offset remaining impacts—and then only with credible offset plans that fully account foruncertainties in delivering environmental compensation.4. An independent umpireWe need a well-resourced, independent umpire, operating at arms length from government. This ""independent cop on the beat"" will need powers to prevent activities and developments deemed too harmful for biodiversity.The government has vowed to create a nationalEnvironmental Protection Agency. The functioning and powers of such an entity risk being severely undermined if the environment minister of the day has the ability to ""call-in"" projects and make unilateral decisions over whether they can proceed. That would also create concern regarding industry influence andpressure on ministers to approve projects.It's essential ministers not only have regard for environmental standards but also follow them to the letter of the law.5. 'A Voice for Country' and cultureOur national environment laws must make room for genuine Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders participation in how matters of cultural and environmental significance are managed.Our new nature laws must interact with federal cultural heritage laws, which are also under reform. Entities of cultural significance, such as humpback whales and dingoes, must be cared for in a way deemed appropriate by Indigenous Australians. Such a mechanism must be co-designed with Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islanders.Policy must continue to be developed in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander people. We suggest a Land and Sea Country Commissioner, ""a Voice for Country,"" could lead this ongoing collaboration. We also need to ensure groups are adequately resourced and supported to Care for Country.We must do betterThe time has come to lift our ambitions and truly protect our nation's precious environment and biodiversity.Australianswant effective, urgent actionfrom government. For cultural, social, economic and environmental reasons, biodiversity conservation should be treated as a public good and receive bipartisan support. It's not an optional extra.

SAN FRANCISCO — President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will hold their first face-to-face talks in a year next week, a meeting that analysts say could help stabilize a shaky relationship but probably won't change its trajectory. U.S.-China ties have long been mired in disagreements over trade, technology, security and human rights, but mistrust and friction have increased markedly in recent years and the Biden administration has re-framed the relationship as one that is fundamentally competitive. Biden and Xi will have ""in-depth discussions"" on Nov. 15 in the San Francisco Bay Area as leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies gather for an annual meeting in the city, a senior Biden administration official said. The announcement follows months of back-and-forth diplomacy to smooth over disagreements and set the stage for the leaders' first interaction sincethey sat down together in Bali, Indonesia, for a few hours last November. Another administration official sought to temper expectations. ""This is not the relationship of five or 10 years ago. We're not talking about a long list of outcomes or deliverables. The goals here really are about managing the competition, preventing the down-side risk of conflict, and ensuring channels of communication are open,"" the official said. Already-tense relations were sidetracked after an alleged Chinese spy balloon was spotted drifting across the United States in February. The Biden administration says the balloon was equipped with high tech surveillance gear, and shot it down. China says it was a weather balloon that was blown off course, and accused the U.S. of overreacting. Since the summer, both sides have made efforts to re-engage. The Biden administration sent three cabinet members and climate czar John Kerry to China. Beijing reciprocated by sending Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Washington in October. And the ruling Communist Party's top economic official, He Lifeng, is meeting Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in San Francisco this week. Sub-national exchanges have also been on the rise, with a group ofU.S. mayorsand thePhiladelphia Orchestravisiting China this week. Analysts say Biden and Xi are likely to agree to continue to build on the momentum around dialogue. ""I don't think either side are going in expecting major deliverables or major breakthroughs in the relationship, but it could empower the two sides to continue to make progress on areas where we've seen improvement,"" said Bonny Lin, Director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic & International Studies in Washington. She points to so-called people-to-people ties, increased travel between the two countries in the wake of the pandemic, and cooperation on climate change. ""Those are good signs in terms of institutionalizing the dialogue below the two presidents,"" Lin said. The Biden administration has been frustrated by what it sees as insufficient Chinese government action to stop the flow of chemical precursors for fentanyl, which is at the center of the U.S. drug overdose epidemic. Officials say it's become a top issue in U.S.-China ties. The first administration official said Biden will ""press assertively"" to re-start high level military-to-military dialogue, which was all but severed completely by China after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August 2022. American officials argue that regular lines of communication are necessary to help de-escalate in the event of a mishap, and some see the chances of such a mishap growing as tensions simmer over the South China Sea and Taiwan, where the two countries' militaries often operate in close proximity. Oriana Skylar Mastro, a China expert at Stanford University and author of the forthcoming bookUpstart: How China Became a Great Power, says she expects the dialogue to resume, but says it's unclear how sustainable or useful it can be given that China tends to uses it as a diplomatic tool. ""You can expect that the next time they get unhappy about something, maybe after the Taiwan election, that they cut them off again. So, unless we have some sort of commitment to sustained engagement, the mil-to-mil exchanges are unlikely to be sufficient to stabilize the relationship,"" she said. Taiwan is scheduled to hold a presidential election in January. The first senior administration official said the level of China's commitment to stabilizing the relationship remains unclear. ""The question really on the table: Is China seeking these steps for tactical or short term measures, or are they seeking to truly improve relations with the United States and other allies and partners? And we're going to interrogate those assumptions closely and clearly,"" the official said. Experts say Xi will look for reassurances from Biden that U.S. policy toward Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of China, is not changing. Friction and concern over the fate of the self-ruled island has risen in recent years, in part due to increased military activity by China in the seas and skies around Taiwan. Despite their differences, both Beijing and Washington have paid lip service to the need to continue to engage one another economically, as well as on issues of common concern like climate change. Earlier this week, Chinese Vice President Han Zhengsaidrecent official interactions between the two countries had sent a positive signal, and Beijing is ready to strengthen dialogue with the U.S. ""at all levels"".",0.0,0.0

Also badly affected were Newry, Kilkeel, Portadown and Templepatrick, with many roads closed and waterlogged fields a common sight. As the clean-up begins, we ask: is flooding becoming more common in Northern Ireland and what can we do about it? According to the Department for Infrastructure, 45,000 properties in Northern Ireland are at risk of flooding from rivers, sea or surface water. Flood Maps NI has a historical flooding overlay. There is also a climate change overlay, based on the best available predictions. All of that data feeds into planning and preparation for floods. Flood waters recede but recovery takes longer - cleaning houses, redecorating, claiming on insurance if you're lucky enough to have it and even trying to find somewhere else to live or operate a business. Northern Ireland's Flood Risk Management Plan talks about resistance and resilience. Resistance covers actions like installing floodgates. Resilience is ""bounce-back-ability"" - how easy your property is to clean and dry out. Neither of these is cheap and and when water is creeping in they will not be at the forefront of your mind. But resistance and resilience apply for councils and government departments too - they can supply sandbag banks in high-risk areas and organise their distribution in an emergency. They can provide information when flooding is expected and help when it happens. It's also about predicting where is at risk and what's needed if the worst happens. When you have more than two centuries of weather records, changes become much clearer. At Armagh Observatory, October 2023 has provided food for thought. According to the observatory's measurements, last month was the wettest month ever - breaking a record that had stood since 1870. Met Office records for Northern Ireland put last month fifth on the all-time list for the wettest Octobers. It's hard to say for definite but warmer air holds more moisture so a warmer atmosphere will produce more rain - to quote observatory director Prof Michael Burton: ""That's physics."" The atmosphere is warming, causing more rain, but human changes may also affect how likely flooding is. Perhaps property has been built on a floodplain. A river's course may have been altered, affecting where and how quickly the water flows. Northern Ireland is one of the least wooded parts of Europe, says the Woodland Trust - trees are nature's way of creating flood barriers and reducing soil erosion. People may point to farming and its impact on our environment. Yes, agriculture is the largest producer of greenhouse gases in Northern Ireland but farmers are also affected by extreme weather. If fields are flooded, that can hamper productivity and slow down planting or ploughing and tilling. The new Farm Support and Development programme includes emissions reduction, farming with nature, carbon benchmarking and increasing sustainability. Explained: The support available if your business floods In pictures: Floods cause havoc across Northern Ireland Watch: Rowing to the rescue of those trapped by floods It's difficult to point to one single event and say: 'That's climate change' - it's a cumulative effect. Data from the Armagh Observatory and weather stations all over Ireland has been analysed by researchers at the Icarus Climate Research Centre in Maynooth University. It found clear signals of climate change - an increase in both rainfall and rainfall intensity, and an average temperature rise in Ireland of 0.88C for every degree of warming on a global scale. Prof Conor Murphy said that in some areas temperatures were increasing at an even higher rate. In some places, winter rainfall intensity increased by as much as 20% and that, he said, meant an increased risk of flooding. Look at Newry - it has flood walls dating back to the 19th Century but the floodwater breached those this week. The Department of Infrastructure said it spent £22.7m on flood risk management projects in 2022-23. It said annual investment ""of at least £30m"" would provide a long-term solution, with £8m required for maintenance of existing flood management infrastructure. Just £3m was spent on that maintenance in each of the past two years. But that level of funding is not available in the 2023-24 budget ""when balanced against the need to deliver other essential public services"", so funding will therefore be directed where it has ""the most impact"". These are big-picture issues that can appear beyond our control - it probably felt that way for everyone affected by flooding this week. But modern climate change did not happen all at once - it happened one piece of coal, one felled tree, one uninformed choice at a time. Tackling it will also be a choice for all of us - how we travel, what waste we produce, how we use energy, plant trees, protect peatlands and use our consumer power to make a change.",-1.0,1.0

Well over a century after the Age of Sail gave way to coal- and oil-burning ships, climate change concerns are prompting a new look at an old technology that could once again harness wind to propel commercial cargo ships — this time with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Imagine what looks like Boeing 747 wings with movable flaps, set vertically on a ship's deck. The vessel cruises under minimum power from its giant engine as computerized sensors adjust the fiberglass wings to take advantage of the wind's speed and direction. This wind-assisted propulsion saves a substantial amount of fuel and reduces the carbon belching from the ship's stack. Many experts think the idea has the potential to navigate the notoriously dirty shipping industry toward a greener future. Loading... ""Shipping is kind of unique,"" says Gavin Allwright, secretary-general of the International Windship Association (IWSA), a not-for-profit trade organization that advocates for wind propulsion in commercial shipping. From antiquity, ships used clean and free wind energy, ""then we carbonized and now we're going back to zero carbon."" At least that's the hope. About 90% of the world's goods — everything from soybeans to sneakers — are transported by sea. The tens of thousands of ships used to get these goods to global markets account foran estimated 3%of the world's carbon emissions each year, a figure thatexceeds Japan's annual emissions.Left unchecked, the shipping industry's greenhouse gas emissions are expected togrow 50% by 2050. Although commercial shipping wasn't included in the 2015 Paris Agreement, there's a huge economic incentive for the industry to decarbonize. The European Union'sEmissions Trading Systemwill cover the maritime industry beginning next year, meaning shippers will be forced to pay for their carbon emissions. Also in 2024, the United Nations' International Maritime Organization (IMO) will grade each ship based on its cargo-carrying capacity and how many grams of CO2 it emits per nautical mile. Vessels with the poorest ratings will be required to take corrective action or risk not being allowed to operate. It's part of the IMO's ambitious goal to get the shipping industry to net zero emissions by 2050. Allwright says renewed interest in windships started to gain steam in the early 2010s, and today there are about 30 large commercial ships using one of a number of such technologies. Shipping giantsMaerskandNYKare already experimenting with such systems. As many as 20 more are expected in the months ahead. So far, they are mostly ""testbeds"" to see if the concept is commercially viable. In one recent trial, the 751-foot bulk carrier Pyxis Ocean operated by Cargill was retrofitted with two rigid sails, known as WindWings, inspired by thosefound on modern America's Cup racers. The vessel, carrying only water ballast, arrived in Paranaguá, Brazil, last month after an approximately 10,000-nautical-mile journey from Singapore. The articulated fiberglass and metal wings, which stand 123 feet tall, use the force of the wind to create lift and move the ship forward. The wings can be folded on deck in case of unsuitable wind or heavy weather and while in port, where they would interfere with loading and unloading operations. John Cooper, the CEO of BAR Technologies, which developed the WindWings, says it took considerable engineering and computer modeling to move the concept from high-tech racing boats to a commercial bulk carrier. On the America's Cup boats, ""the hydrodynamic resistance is quite low,"" he says, compared to the ""humongous"" dynamic drag of a commercial ship. On its first voyage last month after it was retrofitted, the 5-year-old Pyxis Ocean hit 16.2 knots (18.6 miles per hour) with the WindWings working in tandem with the ship's engine running at minimum power, Cooper says. Before departing for Brazil, the ship even sailed briefly without the engine. ""We pulled the anchor up, we put the wings up, turned them into their flying shape, and we cruised our way off berth,"" he says. ""The crew were dumbfounded."" Variations on the rigid wing concept are being tried elsewhere. One system, first developed in the 1920s, is a bigger departure.""Rotor sails,"" or large carbon-fiber cylinders, move a ship along using a principle known as the Magnus effect, an aerodynamic force perpendicular to both the direction of the airstream and the axis of the rotor. ""I would say there's a competition right now,"" says Matthew Collette, a naval architect who teaches ship design at the University of Michigan. The wings on Pyxis Ocean are ""more complicated, [but] potentially more efficient. The rotor sails are very simple, a little bit more limited in what you can do with them."" ""But no one is talking costs openly,"" he adds. In the case of WindWings, Cargill and BAR say a prototype system installed on a retrofitted ship is not a good indicator of ultimate cost, either for an initial installation or for operation. Ships built from the keel up to optimize the wing technology will show a clearer picture. Allwright of the Windship Association estimates that, on average, wing technology amounts to $3 million to $4 million tacked on to a $100 million ship. ""It's not insignificant, but it's also not a huge expense,"" he says. With so many overlapping interests in the shipping industry, simply getting agreement to try a system such as WindWings is no small matter, according to Jan Dieleman, president of Cargill Ocean Transportation. ""You have to work together and somehow share the risk,"" Dieleman says. ""An owner is not just going to put all kinds of installations on [a] ship if they don't know if somebody is actually going to pay them for that."" MC Shipping, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp., owns the Pyxis Ocean, but Cargill, which operates it on long-term lease, agreed to put up the money for the WindWings installation, with help from a small EU subsidy. ""We get the fuel savings because the fuel savings go to the operator and that's how we are going to make it work,"" he says. On a retrofitted ship, such as the Pyxis Ocean, it could take anywhere from seven to 10 years to recoup the initial investment of wing technology, ""which is not extremely sexy for the average commercial operator in this industry,"" Dieleman acknowledges. The shipping industry is also looking ahead to new fuels, such as ammonia and methanol, that would be cleaner burning and put out less carbon — especially if used with new wind technologies. Those cleaner fuels, however, are likely to be much costlier than today's relatively cheap, but more polluting ones. WindWings being fitted on Pyxis Ocean at the COSCO shipyard in Shanghai, China, in August.Cargillhide caption WindWings being fitted on Pyxis Ocean at the COSCO shipyard in Shanghai, China, in August. Fitting WindWings or a similar technology on a cargo ship or on oil tankers is no easy task, but it's simpler than retrofitting some other types of vessels, Collette says. ""The deck space is a high priority on both vehicle carriers and container ships. So you're now giving up cargo as well as potentially modifying the ship design,"" he says. Despite those potential obstacles, earlier this year the French firm Zéphyr & Boréeplaced an orderwith South Korean shipbuilder Hyundai for five purpose-designed container windships with methanol-fueled engines. Vessels designed and purpose-built as windships that burn cleaner fuel are the future that Dieleman envisions. It could cut a 10-year payback for WindWings to just three to five years, he says. In that case, it becomes ""something very interesting on a ship that normally has a lifetime of, say, 20 to 25 years."" And fuel costs could be cut by nearly a third if a vessel were built specifically with WindWings in mind, according to Dieleman. While the Pyxis Ocean continues its trial, BergeBulk, which owns and manages a fleet of some 80 bulk carriers, also plans to install WindWings on one of its vessels. And rotor sails made by Finland-basedNorsepowerhave been installed on commercial vessels inChinaandJapan. WindWings may be an entirely modern take on the old sailing ships, but the technology could revive some of the old clipper ship routes that have long fallen out of favor, BAR's Cooper says. ""You can see some of those old routes coming back,"" Cooper says. ""You know, there's probably an argument for continually circling the world in a single direction rather than going backwards and forwards. Just keep going round the world to take advantage of the trade winds."" Loading... NPR's international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam contributed to this report.",1.0,0.0

This validation confirms that Sanoma’s climate strategy and business model are compatible with transition to a sustainable economy and limiting of global warming to 1.5°C in line with the Paris Agreement. “Sanoma’s K12 learning services and independent media have a highly positive net impact on  society. As producing reliable and fact-based content is the core of our business, ensuring that our climate action and transition plans are science-based and ambitious is key to us. This is why were are especially happy with the validation of our climate targets by SBTi,” saysAlex Green,CFO of Sanoma. Sanoma’s carbon footprint in 2022 was about 157,000 tonne of CO2equivalents, which for comparison corresponds to about 0.3% of the national annual carbon footprint of Finland. Sanoma’s validated SBTi target for own operations is to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 42% by 2030 from a 2021 base year. In practice, Sanoma focuses especially on reducing emissions caused by district heating and cooling of its premises and by company cars. Own operations’ emissions generate about 5% of Sanoma’s total annual carbon footprint. During 2020−2021 Sanoma halved these emissions, and they declined by further 7% in 2022. The reductions were mainly a result of investments in energy efficiency and use of renewable electricity as well as moving to renewable heating. In the coming years, own operations’ emissions are expected to continue to decline remarkably due to further investments in use of renewable energy. Sanoma’s most significant climate impacts derive from the indirect supply chain emissions. Sanoma’s validated SBTi target is to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services, fuel and energy related activities, and upstream transportation and distribution by 38% by 2030 from a 2021 base year. Sanoma’s climate transition plan for value chain emissions is already in line with this target. During 2022, Sanoma’s relevant Scope 3 value chain emissions declined by 8.2% as a result of several initiatives related to the use of materials, logistics and services. The climate targets are well-integrated into Sanoma’s strategy and way of working. Together with development of inclusive learning solutions, Sanoma’s s science-based targets are linked as sustainability KPIs to its EUR 300 million Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility signed in November 2022 and maturing in November 2026. In 2022, Sanoma was awarded with the leadership level score of A- in the global CDP Climate Change rating, considered the gold standard of corporate environmental transparency.

Which it is, one must say, doing with aplomb. The three India-assisted development projects in  Bangladesh  jointly inaugurated by Prime Ministers  Narendra Modi  and Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday marks an important moment not just in the bilateral ties between both democracies, but is also regional foreign policy 101 as it should be. The projects in the railways, power and port sectors are critical to creating jobs, growing the economy and improving lives in Bangladesh. Emerging as the major development partner,  India  also gains. A reminder that a partnership in which both countries gain is the only sure way to ensure peace, prosperity and growth in the region. These projects are part of New Delhi's broader efforts to be a partner that seeks to address needs of identified neighbours,  Sri Lanka  being the other case. With Colombo, it's not just about infrastructure like railways but also about debt restructuring and ameliorating economic crises. These efforts should serve as demonstration of what a partnership with India looks like, and establish it as a viable alternative to other less-friendly partnership models. India should look at expanding this cooperation to address existential challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss to focus on the industries of the future that deal with clean energy, improving resilience and adaptive capacities.  South Asia  is particularly vulnerable to climate change damage. Regional cooperation in South Asia has moved a long way from the old  Saarc  days. The challenges that South Asian countries face are not only collective but also bilateral action. India's approach of emerging as the 'major development partner' for countries in the region, one neighbour at a time, serves as a demonstration effect for others. It also helps counter concerns of a 'Big Brother India' that has understandably existed. Print Edition Friday, 03 Nov, 2023 Experience Your Economic Times Newspaper, The Digital Way!

(Photo/AP) PARIS: Breaching the global warming limits of the world's climate goals could see the melting of Greenland's ice sheet add more than a metre to rising  sea levels , according to new research on Wednesday. But the study by an international team of researchers found there would still be hope to prevent a collapse of the ice sheet -- if warming is reversed and brought back to the safer level. The melting of Greenland's vast ice sheet -- the world's second-largest after Antarctica -- is estimated to have contributed more than 20 percent to observed sea level rise since 2002. Rising sea levels threaten to intensify flooding in coastal and island communities that are home hundreds of millions of people, and could eventually submerge whole island nations and seafront cities. A study published in the journal Nature on Wednesday used two models to simulate how Greenland's ice sheet would respond to future temperature increases over timescales ranging from hundreds to thousands of years. Researchers suggested abrupt ice sheet losses would be triggered if global average temperatures reached a range of 1.7C-2.3C above pre-industrial levels. That would risk a permanent ""tipping point"" that would see near-complete melting of the  Greenland ice sheet  over hundreds or thousands of years and could lift oceans by seven metres (23 feet), redrawing the world map. But if the temperature increases were rolled back to the Paris deal 1.5C limit quickly enough -- by removing planet-heating pollution from the atmosphere using vast reforestation or technologies to capture carbon and permanently store it -- then the worst could be avoided. ""We found that the ice sheet reacts so slowly to human-made warming that reversing the current warming trend by cutting greenhouse gas emissions within centuries may prevent it from tipping,"" said study co-author Niklas Boers from the  Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research . ""Yet, also just temporarily overshooting the temperature thresholds can still lead to a peak in sea level rise of more than a metre in our simulations."" Other tipping points in the Earth system may be breached far sooner, the researchers said, including rainforests and ocean current systems that change in much shorter timeframes. ""The  Greenland ice  sheet is likely more resistant to short-term warming"" than previously thought, said Nils Bochow, a researcher at the Arctic University of Norway and lead author of the study. But the researchers stressed that returning temperatures to below the ""safe"" threshold for the Greenland ice sheet would be far harder than keeping them below the limit in the first place. World leaders will gather in Dubai from November 30 for crunch UN talks on slashing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to and financially bracing for the impacts of  climate change . Technologies to reduce temperatures on such a vast scale may not exist, Bochow told AFP. ""We should try everything today to keep the temperatures in a safe range rather than betting that we can reduce them later,"" he said. Experience Your Economic Times Newspaper, The Digital Way!

The Covid-19 pandemic was the greatest health crisis of our time, leading to severe economic and social disruptions. At the same time, climate change is impacting vulnerable communities with increasingly frequent heatwaves and extreme weather events, and the ongoing war in Ukraine is exacerbating a global food shortage. These crises, which have hit the Global South the hardest, are widening existing inequalities and reversing decades of hard-won progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. Given these challenges, The Rockefeller Foundation (Foundation) has had to continue evolving the way it creates systemic change. We have a 110-year legacy of promoting the well-being of humanity through scientific philanthropy, which we pursue by identifying new advances and forging partnerships across the public and private sectors, civil society, and elsewhere to scale them. Through those innovations and partnerships, the Foundation is helping build a greener, healthier, better nourished, and more equitable world. From 2020 to 2022, the Foundation distributed 1.45 billion USD to 577 global partners, 217 million USD of which was invested in Asia and the Pacific. The Foundation’s work during the pandemic ultimately led to the distribution of millions of Covid-19 tests in India, Africa, and Latin America, bolstering diagnostic capabilities and helping counter the Delta variant. Our Indigenization of Diagnostics Initiative (InDx) stimulated local test kit manufacturing in India, drove a ten-fold increase in PCR manufacturing, and reduced kit costs by 60%. Insights gained from InDx were later adopted by the India G20 presidency's countermeasures platform, reaching a global audience. It is now essential to reinforce partnerships and reimagine development finance to combat the threats of climate change. The Foundation has partnered for years with Smart Power India (SPI) to support India’s clean energy transition and is continuing that work through the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP). Our mini-grid programs have helped provide power and opportunity to millions in rural India — like the shrimp farmer in rural Odisha who was able to transition from polluting diesel aerators to solar panels, lowering costs, optimizing pond oxygenation, and fostering a healthier harvest. The Foundation launched GEAPP because we know that no single institution can face the climate crisis alone. The moment demands bold investments and large, sustainable alliances to drive systemic change. It is time to make big bets for humanity, funding direct and pooled finance vehicles that can help catalyze private investment for climate and development action. Philanthropies also need to acknowledge when to lead and when to lift, because often it is the work at the local level that fuels meaningful change. It is important to determine local partners’ needs and build solutions for the contexts in which they operate. Development organizations tend to adopt the top-down approach, hoping decision-makers in the Global South will readily engage with and validate their recommendations. Many times, this approach is grounded in faulty assumptions, which leads to flawed solutions. It is necessary to recognize that innovative solutions alone do not guarantee success, and that it takes time to build trust with local communities. This can be built by thoroughly researching local challenges and co-developing solutions with the right actors. Convenings and consensus-building can also help develop trust. Ongoing, timely monitoring and evaluation have allowed our Foundation to evaluate our effectiveness and adjust our approach when necessary. Only by deploying new innovations, developing unlikely partnerships, and continuously measuring our progress can we create the large-scale change we need to build a sustainable, equitable world.",1.0,0.0

High temperatures due to human-caused climate change made the drought ""much more likely to happen"" -- about 25 times more likely in Syria and Iraq and 16 times more likely in Iran, according to the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group. ""Human-induced climate change has increased the intensity of such a drought such that it would not have been classified as a drought in a 1.2C cooler world,"" said the scientists. It found that existing vulnerability from ""years of conflict and political instability"" also reduced people's ability to respond to the drought, sparking a ""humanitarian disaster"". The research focused on the period from July 2020 to June 2023 in two regions where impacts have been most severe: Iran, and the basin of the Tigris and the Euphrates, the rivers that cross Syria and Iraq. Both regions are currently experiencing an ""extreme drought"" as classified by the US Drought Monitor scale, said the scientists in a statement. ""After quite good rains in 2020 and good harvests, three years of very low rainfalls followed with very high temperatures led to a drought with very severe impacts on agricultural access to potable water,"" said co-author Friederike Otto, of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. In an online briefing, co-author Mohammad Rahimi from Iran's Semnan University, called for better resource management. ""Historically we didn't have a lot of rain so this is normal for our region, but the increase in temperature is a new topic,"" he said. Rising temperatures in coming years threaten to evaporate much of the region's precipitation, according to Rahimi. ""We anticipate that we will have more evaporation and transpiration from the plants so am not so optimistic for the future,"" he added. In Iraq, one of the world's leading oil producers, and in war-torn Syria, AFP journalists regularly observe the repercussions of climate change and the drought's impacts on the most vulnerable populations. Both countries have seen a drastic drop in agricultural production in recent years, particularly among wheat farmers. Reduced river flows and water pollution have left little catch for fishermen. By September 2022, the drought had displaced nearly two million people living in rural areas in Syria, according to the WWA. In Iran, water shortages have ""led to tensions with neighbouring countries"" and soaring food prices, the statement said. Conflicts over water are also on the rise in Iraq, where a recent UN report found one in five citizens in the country of 43 million people already suffered from water insecurity. High levels of water stress are exacerbated by a multitude of factors, including inefficient irrigation methods, outdated water treatment plants and rapid population growth. Key water systems are also increasingly sabotaged during conflicts. The scientists warned that ""long-lasting severe droughts like these are no longer rare events"". Instead, they can be expected to occur once every decade in Syria and Iraq, and twice every decade in Iran. ""With every degree of warming, Syria, Iraq and Iran will become even harsher places to live,"" said Rahimi.",-1.0,-1.0

To meet climate goals, countries will have to get far more ambitious and quickly. Here's what to look for at COP28.   The world's premier  climate change  conference next month will be hosted by a country among those arguably with the most to lose from more ambitious climate action.   The global community is required to take ambitious actions to respond to climate change but host the United Arab Emirates might be one of those most challenged by the need to broker a faster shift away from high-emission fuels.   When COP28 - the United Nations Climate Change Conference - convenes in Dubai on 30 November, the crucial question will be how to balance the speed of energy transition and economic transformation against the needs of sustainable development and alternative energy sources.   After five years, the conference is returning to Asia, hosted by a country that is the eighth-largest global oil producer and is among the highest per capita emitters in the world.   But while the United Arab Emirates is happy to host COP28, it's too soon to say whether such a rich country would be willing to reduce its absolute dependence on oil resources.   It's also yet to be seen whether the  UAE  is willing to bring down its emissions in pursuit of a global goal, especially when many aspects of the Paris Agreement - a landmark climate treaty struck at COP in 2015 - are yet to become fully functional.   Although the UAE is a rich nation, it is connected to developing economies by climate change. It is a part of the Global South and a member of the G77 and China group.   The host nation's political and ideological leanings on climate change align with countries that see climate change as a global challenge resulting from cumulative emissions, and also as one that affects their economic resources and infrastructure hugely and harshly.   For such countries, addressing climate change means bearing a massive cost to their economies, sacrificing their development to support a clean energy transition.   Just energy transition is not the only issue that will cause agitation at COP28.   The UAE, as holder of the COP presidency, will have to deal with four other major tasks: getting agreements on the Global Stocktake of climate action; building consensus on Global Goal on Adaptation; setting up the Loss and Damage Fund; and advancing climate finance commitments beyond 2025.   Discussions on finance will likely move slowly. The New Collective Qualified Goal of finance under the Paris Agreement is set to be finalised in 2024 and implemented in 2025, and there are still issues over raising money from multilateral development banks and the private sector.   However, the host country will have to ensure that the talks go beyond just reaffirming the existing USD 100 billion pledge.   An estimated USD 4 trillion a year needs to be mobilised by 2030 to support the clean energy transition.   Achieving the net zero goal by mid-century requires much more than that. The UAE will need to work with governments, as well as multilateral development banks and financial institutions, to enhance the scope and scale of climate finance.   The Global Stocktake and the Loss and Damage Fund, both of which have big implications for developing economies, will test the ability of the presidency to remain neutral while adhering to the principles of the Paris Agreement.   UAE recently attended the G20 summit in  Delhi  as an invitee and climate change and energy transition were discussed at length.   The G20 does not set the terms of negotiations for climate conferences, but it is hard to imagine that the COP28 host countries and other major players in climate are not influenced by it, given the grouping's global power.   The G20 has recognised and supported the global emission reduction target reductions, as suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and called for a 43 per cent reduction in emissions from 2019 levels by 2030.   It has also endorsed a global peaking of emissions by 2025 and backed the demand for scaled up finance - USD 5.9 trillion a year to meet the global net zero goal.   The G20 has underscored the necessity of developed economies meeting their commitments on climate finance at previous COPs, exhorting them to scale up contributions from billions to the promised trillions.   The first synthesis report of the technical dialogue on the Global Stocktake of climate actions was released in September 2023 by the  UN Framework Convention on Climate Change  secretariat.   The report says the pace of global emissions does not meet desired global mitigation pathways laid out in the Paris Agreement to achieve the temperature goal of 2 degrees Celsius below the pre-industrial level.   To stay below that maximum temperature, every country needs to do a lot more and effectively transform all sectors of the world economy.   But the Global Stocktake dialogue report is silent on what might be done to bridge the widening gap between the existing efforts of countries and the options that can be adopted in time for the next cycle of Nationally Determined Contributions in 2025.   The fractured debate over future action and on the formulations that emerged from the G20's Delhi Declaration mean the presidency might find it difficult to seek more concessions on the fossil fuel phaseout beyond those agreed in Glasgow in 2021.   In Glasgow, parties agreed to phase down unabated coal-based energy but left other  fossil fuels  like oil and natural gas untouched beyond subsidy reduction targets. In 2022, the G20 adopted the same language.   There are no meaningful signs that developed economies have tweaked or peaked their emissions substantially since Glasgow. The strains on the global energy system and costs imposed by the Russia-Ukraine war make it doubly difficult to negotiate an immediate scaling down of conventional fuels. A reduction on conventional fuels would be difficult to achieve unless renewable energy is rapidly and significantly scaled up globally.   Both the Clean Energy Ministerial of major economies and the G20 have recently raised the possibility of setting new global targets. Options raised include tripling global renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030.   There is an expectation within the oil industry that the UAE might seek support for carbon capture storage technologies as a way of balancing its emissions from oil production and use it as a condition for agreeing to such targets.   India has been generally suspicious of carbon capture and storage technology because of its cost and doubts over technical feasibility.   Technological progress has been slow and is yet to make any dent on the energy system.   However, promising initiatives on clean technologies have emerged, including the Green Hydrogen Innovation Centre under the purview of the International Solar Alliance. A Global Biofuel Alliance has also been launched by the G20.   If recognised at COP28, these initiatives might boost international efforts to produce, trade and use low or zero-emission fuels. But all of these are likely to make an impact only in the medium or long term.   With the Global Stocktake sending a message that the world is not on track to meet the climate change challenge, the UAE as host of COP28 will have its task cut out.   It will need to assure the world that even as an oil producer it is willing to put its weight behind the technologies and policy choices key to achieving emission cuts and use its prestige as host to achieve consensus on increased climate finance for developing economies.

[+] in making it happen. While it's easy for companies to promote long-term commitments to carbon emissions reductions, the dirty work of making emissions reductions is the tougher battle. A key reason? “Companies too often work in silos to reduce their emissions and miss out on the creative benefits that come from collaboration,” says Austin Whitman, CEO of the non-profit Climate Neutral. Bringing companies together to collaborate to expedite much-needed responses to challenges associated with carbon emissions is the key mission behind Climate Neutral, which has built a community of 300-plus certified brands working to measure, reduce and compensate for their respective carbon footprints. Today, big and small brands alike including REI, Peak Design and Nomadix are working under the Climate Neutral umbrella to adopt best practices on how to expedite their carbon reduction efforts. Three key lessons? Take an inventory of scope 3, focus on progress versus perfection and begin working with partners who can help you. Let’s take a closer look at each: 1. Take A Complete Inventory Of Scope 3 Whitman recommends that the best way get a handle on Scope 3 is to take a complete inventory that includes a Scope 3 focus. On average, Scope 3 makes up over 70% of a brand’s total footprint. For Peak Design, Scope 3 emissions account for over 99% of their total emissions. Annie Nyborg, head of environmental and social impact at Peak Design, shares, ""It's the largest source of emissions, and unfortunately, some of the most challenging to address."" Continues Nyborg, “My suggestion is that, after calculating your footprint, identify your top one or two hotspots and start digging in. Materials are often one of the largest emissions culprits, so start researching low-carbon alternatives to the materials you’re using and begin a transition process.” For example, Peak Design, a company that creates bags, tools and accessories, realized that virgin aluminum made up 40% (11,500 tCO2e in 2021) of their annual emissions. The next largest emissions category accounted for just 17%. After hiring a consultant and forming a working group to identify a solution, Peak Design shifted to work with post-industrial recycled aluminum to offer 100% recycled aluminum in new launches, slashing their emissions by over 95%. 2. Begin Working With The Right Partners Once you know the total carbon footprint associated with your brand, the best way to get traction is to find the right partners to work with that will give you the biggest ROI in carbon reductions. Nyborg reflects on Peak Designs’ journey and the importance of finding the right partners. “To our surprise, sourcing recycled aluminum of the quality needed to manufacture our products in China was exceedingly difficult. After years of searching, at the end of 2021, we finally identified a supplier and began the transition of our bag hardware and Capture Clips. In April of 2023, we began the transition of our aluminum tripod legs, center column, cam collars and cam levers.” Going forward, Peak Design has committed that all future products will be made primarily of recycled aluminum. 3. Progress Over Perfection Ask most people in the trenches at their companies, and they will tell you there is no magic bullet to carbon reduction. Mia Helminiak, director of community engagement at Nomadix, says, ""Striving for perfection or being the most sustainable is an overwhelming task and can come across as inauthentic. We’ve found the best approach is to have a mindset of constantly improving, whether through packaging refinements, manufacturing efficiencies or partnerships. Over time, seemingly small wins add up to a very significant impact.” Nyborg shares that Peak Design shares the same progress-over-perfection strategy: “We adopted the saying, ‘No margin, no mission.’ The logic? To continue doing good, Peak Design needs to run a profitable business, and that can sometimes mean unsavory trade-offs or slow transitions.” The Bottom Line? Collaboration Creates Bottom-Line Results Putting these three tips into practice is starting to get real results for Climate Neutral members such as Peak Design and Nomadix. For example, after Nomadix joined Climate Neutral in 2022 they began measuring their carbon emissions. Once Nomadix started peeling back the layers of their emissions, they built out their team internally and externally and achieved 80% emissions reductions between 2021 and 2022. Whitman is excited about what he sees with how community members are doing: “We see across our brands that driving carbon action requires collaboration – collaboration between the executives and the executors, between the brands and the manufacturers, between the retailers and their suppliers. It all matters. At Climate Neutral, we want to be a resource that facilitates shared ideas across these brands. We can't operate in our silos and expect to solve climate change – this requires all of us working together.” As is often the case, collaboration is key. Climate reduction is no different.",1.0,0.0

As the weather becomes more extreme and unpredictable, there are hopes that artificial intelligence—that other existential threat—might be part of the solution.DeepMind, the Google-owned artificial intelligence lab, has been using its AI expertise to tackle the climate change problem in three different ways, as Sims Witherspoon, DeepMind’s climate action lead, explained in an interview ahead of her talk atWIRED Impactin London on November 21. This conversation has been edited for clarity and length. WIRED: How can AI help us tackle climate change? Sims Witherspoon: There are lots of ways we can slice the answer. AI can help us in mitigation. It can help us in adaptation. It can help us with addressing loss and damage. It can help us in biodiversity and ecology and much more. But I think one of the ways that makes it more tangible for most people is to talk about it through the lens of AI’s strengths. I think of it in three parts: First and foremost, AI can help us understand climate change and the problems that we face related to climate change through better models for prediction and monitoring. One example is our work onprecipitation nowcasting—so, forecasting rain a few hours ahead—and our models were voted more useful and more accurate than other methods by Met Office forecasters, which is great. But it’s also just the start because you can then build to predict much more complex phenomena. So AI can be a really significant tool in helping us understand climate change as a problem. What’s the second thing? The second bucket that I like to think about is the fact that AI can help us optimize current systems and existing infrastructure. It’s not enough to start building new green technology for a more sustainable tomorrow, life needs to go on—we already have many systems that we rely on today, and we can’t just burn them all down and start from scratch. We need to be able to optimize those existing systems and infrastructure, and AI is one of the tools that we can use to do this.",1.0,0.0

The estimate is presented in an articlepublishedinFire.The area destroyed by that year's disastrous fires was far larger than had been thought, according to the article. Previous estimates ranged from 14,307 km² to 36,017 km². Led by scientists at the National Space Research Institute (INPE) in Brazil, the study included construction of a model based on satellite images from the European Space Agency's SENTINEL-2 satellite, which was shown to estimate regional-scale burned areas with significantly greater precision and accuracy than other satellite-based models for the Pantanal.The approach used in the study achieved 96% accuracy, and the results ""will help to improve estimates of trace gases and aerosols associated with biomass burning,"" the authors note, adding that ""global biomass burning inventories are widely known for having biases at a regional scale.""The findings highlight the need for approaches that better assess the influence of fire on ecosystems and biodiversity in regions critically sensitive to climate change, such as the Pantanal. Their importance is all the greater in light of the strength of this year's El Niño, which could make the northern portion of the Pantanal and adjacent areas in the Upper Paraguay Basin drier and more susceptible to fire.""The results of the study don't show one model or product to be better than another. Every method has its own strengths and limitations. Estimates tend to vary significantly as a result. However, the images furnished by the MSI [Multispectral Instrument] on board SENTINEL-2 have two positive points:spatial resolutionis 20 meters, providing much better detail of burned areas; and temporal resolution, very important to this type of study, is 5 days, compared with a revisit frequency of up to 16 days for the Landsats,"" said forest engineer Andeise Cerqueira Dutra, an author of the article and a Ph.D. candidate at INPE's Earth Observation and Geoinformatics Division (DIOTG), with Yosio Edemir Shimabukuro as thesis advisor.Shimabukoro is the penultimate author of the article. The last author is Guilherme Augusto Verola Mataveli, also a researcher at DIOTG-INPE.For Mataveli, it is important to refine this type of analysis and obtain regional-scale estimates in order not only to estimate burned areas more accurately but also to calculate greenhouse gas emissions, which directly affectclimate change.""The 2020 Pantanal fire crisis was caused by anextreme drought. Severe drought will tend to be increasingly frequent there and in other parts of Brazil. Knowing more about the impact of these extreme weather events on the biome and its biodiversity will be more and more important to decisions regarding fire management and fire mitigation programs,"" said Mataveli.""Finding ways to improve these products and generate moreaccurate datais very important for society. An example is the pilot project launched this year in the Pantanal, also using remote sensing data to identify areas affected by fire and estimate the accumulation of combustible matter. Managers of environmental agencies and firefighters can use these findings to manage fire in an integrated manner, defining priority areas and actions to combat or control fires,"" Dutra said.ConsequencesThe Pantanal is normally under water in the rainy season, which extends roughly between October and May, and is modulated by the South American Monsoon System (SAMS). The dry season usually begins in June or July. Fires in the region tend to peak in September. However, the pattern changed in 2019, which saw the onset of a prolonged drought that worsened in 2020, when annual precipitation in the Brazilian portion of the Pantanal was the lowest since the 1980s and 26% lower than the 1982–2020 average.As a result, the water surface area shrank 34% compared with the average, the aggregate burned area was 200% more than the long-term average, and 35% burned for the first time on record.The cost of restoration was estimated at USD 123 million. Researchers estimated that the 2020 wildfires killed some 16 millionsmall animals(under 2 kg) and 944,000 larger animals.The Jaguar (Panthera onca), the largest feline species in the Americas, wasespecially hard hit. The fires destroyed 45% of the estimated population of P. onca, or some 450 individuals (87% in Brazil), burning 79% of its home range area and 54% of protected areas within that range. Until then, the Pantanal was home to the second-largest population of jaguars in the world.Another consequence was a rise in the number of people hospitalized for treatment of respiratory problems in the states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, as shown by astudy(in Portuguese) conducted by Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), an arm of Brazil's Health Ministry.MethodologyThe researchers usedsatellite imagesfrom SENTINEL-2 to estimate burned areas in the Brazilian part of the Pantanal in 2020 and compared these with estimates based on MODIS (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensors aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites) and Landsat imaging. The former (MCD64A1 and Fire_cci) gave estimates of 35,837 km² and 36,017 km² respectively, while the latter (MapBiomas Fogo and GABAM) gave estimates of 23,372 km² and 14,307 km².The spatial distribution patterns in these maps were visually similar, but the estimates based on SENTINEL-2 imaging detected a larger number of smaller fires, especially in the eastern Pantanal. ""The model we developed is available to anyone interested, as is the data collected in the validation exercise. We believe they can help researchers engaged in future projects,"" Mataveli said.""Drought is set to be increasingly frequent, andfireepisodes therefore will tend to be more frequent as well, so we expect more collaborative research and a growing supply of data,"" Dutra said. ""We also expect more field data to be accessible, especially for scientists who work with remote sensing to produce more accurate output.""Between January 1 and August 23, 2023, 381 fires were detected in the Pantanal, according todatafrom INPE (in Portuguese). In the same period of 2020, there were 8,127, the highest number since 1998 for the biome. Forest fires have intensified this year in the context of heat waves in Europe and North America, leaving many deaths and ruined neighborhoods in their wake.",-1.0,0.0

This fact no trade deal… [+6104 chars]",Jobs,"WASHINGTON --WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is nurturing economic ties this week with Asia, but he is not signing any trade deals at a regional summit in San Francisco. This fact — no trade deals — reveals much about the status of U.S. politics, the evolving global economy and the Biden administration's ambitions. U.S. negotiators say they have finalized agreements with 13 other countries on three parts of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. The operative word is “framework,"" a label that allows Biden to bypass Congress in reaching agreements in IPEF (pronounced EYE-pef). “It's a framework because the administration wanted to have something it could do by executive agreement,” said Robert Holleyman, a former deputy U.S. trade representative. Many U.S. voters have negative opinions about trade deals they see as having caused industrial job losses, a prevailing sentiment in the 2016 presidential election that carries over to next year's 2024 race. IPEF can partially fill that gap by sidestepping some of the domestic politics while addressing issues such as supply chains and climate change that have historically been outside trade deals. A look at the framework and the progress being announced at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' meeting. Biden formally announced IPEF during a May 2022 trip to Tokyo. It has four major pillars: supply chains, climate, anti-corruption and trade. “We’re writing the new rules for the 21st century economy,” Biden said when the initiative was unveiled. But unlike a traditional trade deal, the framework is not about expanding market access or laying out penalties for unfair practices. The trade pillar is being overseen by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai; the other three are under Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. The U.S. and its partners are announcing a signed agreement on supply chains and agreements in principle on climate and anti-corruption, while negotiators work through parts of the trade pillar, according to people who are tracking the talks. Raimondo told reporters on a call that the U.S. had largely been absent from the Indo-Pacific and that the coronavirus pandemic showed that supply chain problems could damage the American economy. “We all learned during COVID that supply chain disruptions can hurt American workers,” Raimondo said. “And that’s exactly why the president said we need to get back into the region with our partners in the Indo-Pacific.” Besides the U.S., there are 13 members that represent 40% of global gross domestic product. The other members are Australia, Brunei, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, according to the U.S. government. Matthew Goodman, director of the Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said before the leaders' meeting that the White House has been “signaling” the terms of the various agreements. Each pillar is negotiated separately. On trade, there will be some language on agriculture and expanding trade relationships. But the major issues of labor, environmental standards and rules for digital companies are still being negotiated. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, objected to the trade pillar in part because of a lack of worker protections, prompting the administration to not move forward with an agreement on the issue. Brown is up for reelection next year in an increasingly Republican state that identifies with its industrial heritage. “Instead of negotiating trade deals behind closed doors, we should be working to strengthen enforcement so that American workers can compete on a level playing field,” Brown said. The U.S. government has suggested there will be an agreement on the other three pillars. Raimondo said the U.S. signed the supply chain agreement and the countries had reached an agreement on principles on the climate and anti-corruption elements. She said negotiations were concluded on an “overarching” agreement among members that would create a forum for ongoing work together. “This is meant to be an enduring arrangement, an enduring durable framework,” said Raimondo. The climate component includes an economic cooperation component to help support IPEF countries that are moving away from fossil fuels to cleaner forms of energy. The anti-corruption component has legally binding commitments that would improve the transparency of administering taxes. The commerce secretary stressed that the agreements were just a beginning. There will be a $30 million fund on climate-related projects and an investor forum for clean energy technologies, as well as a private-public partnership to bring investments into the region. “It’s the starting line, not the finish line,” she said. Voters say past trade deals caused the loss of factory jobs that hollowed out their hometowns. The administration agrees. The 2016 presidential election was a landmark event on rejecting trade pacts. Both party's candidates, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, walked away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As president, Trump revised the existing trade deal with Canada and Mexico, while raising taxes on a range of imports and starting a trade skirmish with China. Trade deals offer the prospect of cheaper goods and geopolitical stability, a prospect that was also somewhat undermined as the coronavirus pandemic exposed fragile supply chains that were overly dependent on China. Biden has sought to find alternatives to Chinese factories while maintaining the tariffs that Trump imposed on Chinese goods. In a June speech, Tai criticized past trade deals. “If we look at what those agreements did, we see the ways in which they contributed to the very problems we are now trying to address,” said Tai, emphasizing that “our new approach to trade recognizes people as more than just consumers, but also producers —the workers, wage earners, providers, and community members that comprise a vibrant middle class.” Trade deals also take years to negotiate and even longer to finalize across presidential administrations. The last new trade deal was signed with South Korea in 2007 and went into force in 2012. By comparison, IPEF is moving a speedy clip as agreements are being announced after less than two years.",1.0,0.0

By implementing Oceana Canada’s recommendations, Canada can cap single-use plastic waste by 2026 followed by a downward trajectory for our country’s plastic pollution problem. Plastic pollution is the second biggest threat to the planet after climate change, according to the United Nations, and the two are inherently linked. To meaningfully tackle this crisis and to support the government’s zero-plastic waste vision, Oceana Canada’s roadmap outlines the bold action needed. It was also developed in response to the 90 per cent of Canadians surveyed by Oceana Canada who support the single-use plastic ban. “Environment and Climate Change Canada took the first step in banning six categories of unnecessary single-use plastics last year and committing to recycled content requirements, improving plastics labelling and reining in plastic at major grocers across Canada,” said Anthony Merante, Oceana Canada’s Plastics Campaigner. “Plastic pollution is massive and needs to be taken seriously. If the government follows our recommendations, by 2040 Canada will prevent the generation of nine million tonnes of plastic waste. Our data shows that population growth will outweigh the impact of low-ambition policies that are slow walked. Only through ambitious, sector-wide action can Canada reduce plastic waste and become a global leader on the path to a plastic-free future.”Oceana Canada’s recommendations include implementing bans on unnecessary and hard-to-recycle items and pollution prevention (P2) plans for key sectors to establish plastic reduction requirements, refill and reuse provisions, and proven recycling targets. The roadmap identifies the seven sectors that are the greatest sources of single-use plastic collectively generating 41 per cent of plastic packaging waste in Canada. The following actions are recommended for these sectors: “Urgent government action is needed. We can hit peak plastic as soon as 2026 and reduce production and consumption of single-use plastic in every year that follows,” says Kim Elmslie, Oceana Canada’s Campaign Director. “It’s time for leaders in the sectors to step up and address the challenges by putting in measures to end plastic waste. Working collaboratively, we can make a positive impact on the environment, oceans and marine life.” Major national grocery retailers offer the first opportunity to reduce plastic waste in Canada. In the summer of 2023, the government notified major grocers of a P2 plan to reduce unnecessary plastics throughout their operations. If designed and implemented efficiently, these plans could achieve several of the recommendations laid out in the report and greatly reduce plastic packaging waste in Canada. Oceana Canada was established as an independent charity in 2015 and is part of the largest international advocacy group dedicated solely to ocean conservation. Oceana Canada has successfully campaigned to ban single-use plastics, end the shark fin trade, make rebuilding depleted fish populations the law, improve the way fisheries are managed and protect marine habitat. We work with civil society, academics, fishers, Indigenous Peoples and the federal government to return Canada’s formerly vibrant oceans to health and abundance. By restoring Canada’s oceans, we can strengthen our communities, reap greater economic and nutritional benefits, and protect our future. Find out more atwww.oceana.ca.

Nonetheless, the tree's reddish bark, swooping branches and thick, conical base identify it as the Pacific Northwest's iconic western red cedar.Christine Buhl, a forest health specialist for the Oregon Department of Forestry, plunges a tool called an increment borer into the dead tree's trunk. Twisting the handle of the corkscrew-like borer, Buhl extracts a long, thin sample of the tree's inner growth rings.The rings become thinner over time, indicating the tree's growth slowed before the tree finally died, a sign that this red cedar, like thousands of others in Oregon and Washington, died from drought.""That's why it's the canary,"" says Buhl. ""Any tree that's less drought tolerant is going to be the canary in the coal mine. They're going to start bailing (out).""For thousands of years, people have used red cedar to make everything from canoes to clothing.Red cedar's many uses have earned the species endearing names, including the ""Tree of Life."" More recently, scientists have started calling this water-loving relative of redwoods by a less flattering name: ""the climate canary.""Last year, Buhl and colleaguesreported that red cedars were dyingthroughout the tree's growing range not because of a fungus or insect attack, but due to the region's ""climate change-induced drought.""Red cedars aren't alone.In recent years, at least15 native Pacific Northwest tree specieshave experienced growth declines and die-offs, 10 of which have been linked to drought and warming temperatures, according torecent studies and reports.Many researchers, Buhl included, are now arguing that these drought-driven die-offs are the beginning of a much larger and long-predicted shift in tree growing ranges due to climate change.Trees, and plants generally, have growing ranges that are largely determined by climate factors, namely moisture and temperature.For decades, scientists have argued that as atmospheric warming continues, growing ranges in the Northern Hemisphere will shift upslope in elevation and farther north, leaving many trees stranded in a warmer, drier world.As climate mismatch sets in, trees are expected to die-off and not grow back, according to predictions.Daniel DePinte, Forest Service aerial survey program manager, suspects range changes are driving ""Firmageddon."" A term coined by researchers, including DePinte, ""Firmageddon"" refers to the more than 1,875 square-mile (4,856-square-kilometer) die-off of five fir species in Oregon, Washington and northern California.""The forests are moving uphill,"" said DePinte.DePinte and colleagues first identified and named the massive, drought-driven fir ""mortality event"" last year while surveying area forests via airplane.According to tree-range predictions, climate-induced die-offs are expected to start at the edges of growing ranges, including at lower-elevation locations that are predicted to become too warm and dry for many species.DePinte's survey revealed that the largest die-offs associated with Firmageddon are occurring at lower-elevation sites.Buhl and colleagues found a similar pattern with western red cedar. Mortality was greatest at sites less than about 650 feet (200 meters) in elevation west of the Cascade Range, according to their analysis.Scientists have also observed a similar pattern for Douglas fir, the region's leading commercial timber species. Douglas fir is currently experiencing a 720-square-mile (1,865-square-kilometer) die-off, the majority in the Klamath Mountains near the southern Oregon cities of Ashland and Medford.The die-off is limited to the lower elevations but is likely to move uphill as temperatures warm in the coming decades, according to a study in theJournal of Forestry.""Our analysis concluded that if climate change continues as predicted, we could see increased Douglas fir mortality at higher elevations,"" said study co-author, David Shaw, a professor and forest health specialist at Oregon State University.Shaw called the die-off ""consistent with predictions for climate change.""But whereas red cedar is believed to be dying from drought alone, the Firmageddon and Douglas fir die-offs have been linked to a combination of drought weakening trees and insect pests moving in for the kill.""These insects are not normally tree killers,"" said DePinte. ""This is evidence that the forests are reacting to climate change and droughts.""Douglas fir is not considered a true fir and is not officially part of Firmageddon, according to DePinte.The combination of drought-induced stress and pests, said Patrick Tobin, associate professor of disturbance ecology at the University of Washington, is analogous to a person with a weakened immune system dying from the flu.""Drought-stress opens a window for biotic agents that might otherwise not be able to overcome a healthy, well-defended tree,"" said Tobin.Tobin is a co-author of a 2021 study in the journal Forest Ecology and Management on the widespread decline of big leaf maples in western Washington. Tobin's study was unable to determine whether drought alone or drought in combination with disease-causing fungi was killing the native maples.As for the climate canary, Buhl believes red cedar is unlikely to disappear from the landscape entirely but probably won't grow back in areas where it's dying off.""Unless we turn back climate change, there is no reason to hope western red cedar is going to make a comeback,"" said Buhl.Journal information:Forest Ecology and Management© 2023 The Associated Press.

Prince William said he believed this was the decade for collective action to protect the planet.  He announced the winners of the £1m ($1.2m) prize at a ceremony on Tuesday. They include a company making batteries for electric vehicles using components easier to recycle, and a scheme helping famers to cut food waste. In a speech at the awards ceremony in Singapore, Prince William said: ""The last year has been one of great change and even greater challenge. ""A year in which the effects of the climate crisis have become too visible to be ignored. ""And a year that has left so many feeling defeated, their hope dwindling. ""However, as we have seen tonight, hope does remain."" The awards ceremony was co-hosted by actress Hannah Waddingham and actor and producer Sterling K Brown, with attendees including Hollywood star Cate Blanchett and former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. There were also performances from Bastille and OneRepublic, who Prince William revealed his youngest son Louis was a fan of.  Catherine, the Princess of Wales, said she was sorry not to be there, having stayed behind in the UK to help her son George, 10, through his ""first set of major exams"". Her husband Prince William continued his speech on an upbeat note, saying ""we hold onto the most powerful motivators of all - optimism, and hope"". He added: ""I choose to believe that future generations will look back on this decade as the point at which we globally took collective action for our planet. ""The moment we refused to accept the voices of denial and defeatism, and instead, became the architects of change towards a healthy and sustainable world."" The annual awards, in their third year and taking place for the first time in Asia, were created by Prince William to fund projects that aim to save the planet. The prize's name refers to the ""Moonshot"" ambition of 1960s America by then-President John F Kennedy, who pledged to get a man on the Moon within a decade. Protect and Restore Nature: Clean our Air: Revive our Oceans: Build a Waste-free World: Fix our Climate: Cate Blanchett, one of the panel deciding the winners, said there was ""cause for optimism"".  She told BBC News: ""The overwhelming nature of the challenge of tackling climate change, and the urgency of it, can lead to despair and apathy I think quite quickly.  ""And so for this to be harnessing that urgency but in an optimistic way, in a solution-based way, I found gave me personally an enormous amount of courage."" Sir David, another member of the prize council, made a video appearance in which he said ""we can live both well and responsibly on our planet"". Each winner will receive £1m ($1.2m) to develop their innovation. The 15 finalists were whittled down from more than 1,300 nominees. Asked what the prize money meant to him, Constantino Aucca, president of Accion Andina, said: ""It's a million trees, it a million bits of hope, it's a million ways to open new doors."" Meaghan Brosnan, chief operating officer of the Wildaid Marine Programme, said: ""I never believed it would be us… it was an overwhelming feeling… conservation is a team sport. We cannot fix any of these crazy problems alone."" The awards have been made with recycled materials, including brass sourced from water pipe fittings, household waste and minute metal elements filtered from wastewater sludge, and then amalgamated together. Guests were asked to wear ""pre-loved"" clothes. Prince William donned a blazer by Alexander McQueen that he previously wore for the Earthshot Prize awards in 2021. The ceremony is due to be broadcast at 17:20 GMT on Sunday on the BBC in the UK. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.",1.0,0.0

The future of fossil fuels that play a massive role in climate change will be at the heart of COP28 negotiations in Dubai, as the world struggles to meet the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. ""The oil and gas industry is facing a moment of truth at COP28 in Dubai,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said ahead of the November 30-December 12 conference. ""With the world suffering the impacts of a worsening climate crisis, continuing with business as usual is neither socially nor environmentally responsible,"" he said. In a report, the Paris-based energy watchdog said the industry's engagement has been ""minimal"" so far, accounting for less than one percent of global clean energy investment. It invested $20 billion in clean energy last year, or just 2.7 percent of its total capital spending. To meet the Paris Agreement's 1.5C target, the oil and gas sector must devote 50 percent of its investments on clean energy projects by 2030. By comparison, $800 billion is invested in the oil and gas sector each year. While investment in oil and gas supply is still needed, the figure is twice as high as what should be spent to respect the Paris goals, the agency said. ""Producers must choose between contributing to a deepening climate crisis or becoming part of the solution by embracing the shift to clean energy,"" the IEA said. Oil and gas use would fall by 75 percent by 2050 if governments successfully pursued the 1.5C target and emissions from the energy sector reached net zero by then, the report said. Instead of cutting fossil fuels outright, oil giants have touted several once-marginal technologies as promising solutions to cut emissions. They include carbon capture and storage (CCS), direct air capture and carbon credit trading. CCS prevents CO2 from entering the atmosphere by siphoning exhaust from power plants, while direct air capture pulls CO2 from thin air. Both technologies have been demonstrated to work, but remain far from maturity and commercial scalability. ""The industry needs to commit to genuinely helping the world meet its energy needs and climate goals -- which means letting go of the illusion that implausibly large amounts of carbon capture are the solution,"" Birol said. The think tank Carbon Tracker said in September that oil and gas sector emission reduction pledges have stalled and in some cases gone backwards. Oil major BP watered down a previous 2030 production cut target and Shell said its ""liquids"" output would remain stable -- both angering climate campaigners. Campaigners have raised concerns over the influence of fossil fuel interests at the UN climate conference, noting that COP28 president Sultan Al Jaber is both UAE climate envoy and head of state-owned oil firm ADNOC. Jaber has proposed tripling global renewable energy capacity and doubling the annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030. ""The fossil fuel sector must make tough decisions now, and their choices will have consequences for decades to come,"" Birol said. ""Clean energy progress will continue with or without oil and gas producers. However, the journey to net zero emissions will be more costly, and harder to navigate, if the sector is not on board.""",0.0,0.0

Thank you for joining us at this late hour. As you are aware, we've just concluded the 2nd Voice of Global South Summit held in virtual mode. We have with us Shri Vinay Kwatra, Foreign Secretary, Sir, to give us a sense of what the deliberations were and how we look at this event. Also joining us on the dais, Sri P. Kumaran, OSD (ER & DPA) in the Ministry of External Affairs, as well as Shri Raghuram, Joint Secretary (Policy Planning and Research) in the Ministry. Sir, without further ado, I will hand over the floor to you, Sir, for your remarks. Shri Vinay Kwatra, Foreign Secretary: Thank you very much, Arindam, Kumaran, Raghu, JS, PP & R and friends from the media. Thank you very much and for coming at this late hour really in the evening, that too on Friday, for this briefing on the just concluded 2nd Voice of Global South Summit. In fact, I'm just coming back from the concluding session to share with you as to what happened at this day-long Summit today. You would recall the first Summit, the 1st Voice of Global South Summit was held earlier this year in January 2023 and building on the momentum of the achievements of the 1st Global South Summit with the strong leadership of Honorable Prime Minister, it was decided to hold this 2nd Summit, Voice of Global South Summit today. The Summit, like last, the 1st Summit, had Leaders' Sessions, the Inaugural and the Concluding Sessions, and also the eight Ministerial Sessions which included two Sessions of the Foreign Ministers, one devoted to the larger developments around the world and how they impact Global South, and second more on developmental agenda of the Global South. There were also one Ministerial Sessions each of Education, Finance, Environment, Energy, Health and Commerce. I would later be happy to share with you priorities of each of these Ministerial Sessions so that you get a sense of what was the nature of deliberations in the room for each of the Ministerial Sessions. Should you be interested in greater details on the specifics of individual Minister Session, I would be very happy to share them also with you. In terms of the theme, the overarching theme of the 2nd Summit today was 'Together, For Everyone's Growth, With Everyone's Trust', which echoes essentially India's philosophy of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' and is an extension of Honorable Prime Minister's vision of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas', also using it as the guiding principle for the progress of our cooperation within the framework of Global South. Some specifics to share and you would have witnessed that through the live telecast of the Inaugural Session in the morning, the Prime Minister also inaugurated the Global South Center of Excellence, which will be called 'DAKSHIN', that stands for Development and Knowledge Sharing Initiative. You would recall, this was one of the decisions that the Honorable Prime Minister had announced at the Concluding Session of the 1st Summit. We have been working on its implementation for the last several months and Prime Minister inaugurated that session earlier today. The Global South Center of Excellence will work as a think tank, will also work as a repository of knowledge and development initiatives in order to interface with the Global South and seek out ways for forging stronger collaboration with its counterparts in the Global South countries, essentially ensuring that how our capacities and other capacities of Global South can be exchanged among the countries of the Global South. Besides that, Prime Minister also spoke about implementation of four other key decisions which he had announced at the 1st Summit. One was cooperation with the Global South through the Aarogya Maitri initiative, under which we have already commenced several initiatives of cooperation in the health field with the countries of the Global South. Similarly, under the platform of Global South Science and Technology Initiative, which was again announced at the last Summit, cooperation has advanced between India and other countries of the Global South. The Global South Scholarship Program has actually grown extensively since the announcement of this decision in the 1st Summit. Of course, it captures some of the existing programs of Government of India, but it is also expanded in a targeted way, looking at how to use this particular capacity for development cooperation with the countries of the Global South. And, Global South Young Diplomats Forum. This is again something which has already taken off in a very strong way and we hope to grow and progress on it further. If I was to share with you briefly three things. One, to share with you broadly the sense of priorities of each Ministerial Session. Two, based on those thematic drive of individual sessions, what was seen as the shared priorities of the Global South based on the discussions and deliberations today. And then, broad sentiment in the room across the Ministerial Sessions and particularly during the Leaders Sessions, both the inaugural round and also the concluding session. In terms of thematic focus of each of the Ministerial Sessions, I would say, for Education Ministers' Session, the focus was on making human resources future ready. For the Finance Ministers' Session, the focus was on financing people-centric development finance. For the Environment Ministers, the focus was on sustainable solutions for climate resilience and climate finance. Foreign Ministers, as I mentioned, there were two sessions of the Foreign Ministers, and focus; I am converging the two sessions here; was on Global South and one development thematically. Energy Ministers, they focused on affordable and inclusive energy transition for the Global South. The Health Ministers, they aimed at forging stronger cooperation and looking for solutions from the Global South for One Health. And Commerce Ministers, Global South and Resilient Supply Chains, was the focus area for the Commerce Ministers' Session earlier today and Leaders' Session, as I already spoke to you about. Based on these thematic sessions, the shared priorities, if I was to just very briefly list out for your information would be, priority one...and you would have heard this in some detail in the concluding session when Prime Minister spoke about them. One, about 'One Future'. The essential focus being that Global South will shape its future based on cooperation, of course, with the rest of the world, but also more strongly among the Global South countries, based on what I mentioned, the Prime Minister's philosophy of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas'. Also another point of emphasis here was reduction in the East-West dichotomy in terms of specially the development agenda. Second, a shared priority which the Prime Minister highlighted was commitment to sustainable development and particularly with regard to climate action based upon a common but differentiated responsibility principle. Three, insofar as energy transition is concerned; inclusive, affordable and sustainable energy transition was something which was voiced and shared by almost all the member states in today's session. Four, people centric development finance. Of course, it was a theme of the finance ministers but something which came across very strongly across almost all the sessions and one of the underlying thrust areas of emphasis there was, a point from Global South to avoid situations where development initiatives and programs lead to debt trap for Global South. Five, Digital Public Infrastructure, aimed at delivery of public goods of governance, more effective delivery of governance, more efficient delivery of governance. Six, this is something which was echoed very strongly, pretty much uniformly; need for reforming the multilateralism, reforming the multilateral institutions, particularly the Global Financial Institutions and the Security Council. Seven, women led development; a very, very strong area of priority and focus. Eight, something which came across not so sharply in the 1st Summit but came out very sharply this time, which is the need to prioritize investment flows among the Global South countries, linking and leading to increasing development space in those countries. Nine, strengthening cooperation on countering terrorism, spread of terrorism, growth of terrorism and its various manifestations. And tenth, the emphasis on timely and expeditious completion of the SDG 2030 Agenda. This was a kind of, I would say, collective sense of shared priorities that came out of the discussions. In terms of broad sentiments which were layered on some of these priorities which were spoken about in the deliberations across the Leaders' Session and the Ministerial segment was; one, universal sentiment, a sense of recognition, a sense of realization that India and Prime Minister Modi, they mean what they say. This came out in two very specific and express ways. One was, everybody spoke about India's and Prime Minister Modi's leadership in getting African Union to be a permanent member of the G20. But also equally importantly, in ensuring that the priorities and the interest of the Global South, the way they were voiced at the 1st Summit, were not only just tabled for discussions at the G20 meetings in the Summit, but they were also factored in the New Delhi Declaration. New Delhi Declaration actually is a matter of fact, if you see, good more than 50% of it focuses on items of priority to the Global South. So, there was a wide spread recognition of this that India and Prime Minister Modi's leadership has ensured this and this is essentially, walking the talk as External Affairs Minister spoke earlier today. For us, Prime Minister was very clear in articulating that India's G20 was anchored in the priorities of the Global South and that success of our G20, we see it as a success of Global South and this is something which in a way, you know, we found in a way, today's Summit, Global South kind of owned up in a way to the success of the G20 as one of their own, essentially through this. There was one sentiment which was expressed that, insofar as the African Union permanent membership to the G20 is concerned, there was a sentiment which came across that yes, global groupings can be persuaded to respond to the changing global realities and respond in a more inclusive fashion. I think that's what African Union membership represented and that was echoed in the room while expressing gratitude to Prime Minister Modi's leadership here. There was a thought which also was very widely shared across different sessions which was that the challenges that confront the Global South across the development space, across the political space, it is important that Global South should look for Global South answers to the challenges that confront them, but do it through cooperation, consultation and coordination, not through confrontation. So this was a vital sense of the room that Global South answers for the challenges that faced them. There was also a recognition and this has been spoken about at the last Summit of the Global South also, the 1st one, wherein that given the nature of growing uncertainty, conflict, geopolitical tensions across the world, there is a need for Global South to speak more forcefully on these challenges and converge more extensively in searching as the world looks for solutions to these issues. And this is because these uncertainties, these tensions essentially impact the development space and specifics of the Global South and hence there is a need. It's not just a rhetorical need for them to speak, it is because those developments do impact on their economic growth and development. And lastly, as I have also mentioned as one of the shared priorities, a very strong sentiment in the room that there is a need to urgently reform the multilateral institutions, in particular the Global Financial Institutions, the UN Security Council and the overall global financial architecture. We will be circulating at some stage, hopefully tomorrow, a structured capturing of these discussions in a certain form which would be available for you to look for more details but that will be sometime tomorrow morning because it's just concluded. So we need to just work through that. I think I would stop here and if there are questions we'd be happy to take that. Shri Arindam Bagchi, Official Spokesperson: Thank you very much. Please introduce yourself and the organization that you represent. Pia: Hi, Pia with The Print. Sir you had mentioned that debt burden was one of the topics of discussion. Could you expand on that and if there were any explicit concerns about China's role when it comes to this issue? Thank you. Sidhant: Sir Sidhant from WION. Sir, how much was the focus on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas? We saw the comments by the Prime Minister but other leaders, what was the sense in the room when the leaders discussed about this issue? Sahil: Sir, I'm Sahil from ANI. Sir, the India stack was also discussed during this Summit and how many countries showed interest in it? Sudhi Ranjan: Sir, Sudhi Ranjan from Bloomberg Sir. On energy transition and finance being available for development, if you could give us a better sense or an expanded sense of what was the kind of discussion and any actionable points that you.... Shri Arindam Bagchi, Official Spokesperson: Sorry, on financing for development? Sudhi Ranjan: Yes. Dhairya: Sir, Dhairya Maheshwari from Sputnik India. Sir, Prime Minister Modi urged unity among the Global South countries on the conflict, as has been asked. I just wanted to know if there was an unequivocal condemnation of the Hamas attack, because counter-terrorism has been spelled out as one of the priorities by Prime Minister Modi. Thank you, Sir. Shri Vinay Kwatra, Foreign Secretary: Thank you. With regard to the debt burden, this came across very strongly in multiple sessions because financing is a kind of need which stretches across different areas of development cooperation and economic growth of a country. It also is very structural to some of the challenges that are being faced by many of the Global South countries. So, for example, it came in the Leaders' Sessions, in both the Leaders' Sessions. Some of them spoke about it. It definitely came up in the Finance section, in the Finance Ministers' Session. It came up in the External Affairs Ministers' Session that deals with the development priorities. And the thrust of most interventions was that, look, we are facing this very strong headwinds of economic challenges because of global uncertainties. Be that as it may, alongside, we also have very clear and strong developmental priorities across various sectors, and we have the strong challenge of climate, climate crisis, in fact; and this came across very strongly. Everybody's intervention essentially spoke of the need that when they access this financing for their development projects, for climate crisis or for energy transitions, for that matter, it should be in a manner and of a kind which does not impose debt burden on the structural parameters of the economy. It should be more sustainable. Why it should be sustainable? So that the development path that the country is pursuing is also sustainable. Development financing, which causes indebtedness of a country and puts that burden on the economy will obviously make the most part of economic ecosystem unsustainable going forward. So that was the central thrust of the countries. No, I think individual countries were not really referred to, because it was more of a conceptual thing. But everybody knows what kind of credit causes debt, what kind of credit is sustainable. I think underlying recognition is there. But as I said, the focus was more on that, how do I make my development sustainable, and for that sustainability, avoidance of debt burden is actually quite critical. With regard to Israel, Hamas, yes, there was a fair number of leaders, spoke about their concern relating to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. And if I can just capture the query that came from Sputnik also on this, each leader spoke about their own perspective on how they look at the current situation there. So many leaders, almost all leaders, spoke about the challenge of terrorism, which comes from there, the need to provide humanitarian assistance there, horror at the civilian casualties because of the conflict. These three were kind of threads which were sort of common to almost all interventions. So it was discussed. Members, the leaders expressed strong concern at the deteriorating security situation, which has very clear implications of all kinds in many of the countries. Prime Minister himself, you heard him, he spoke about the challenge there. So yes, there was a discussion on this to that extent. Insofar as India stack is concerned, the India stack issue or its relevance for the development of Global South, again, this is something which permeated almost, I would say, all segments of the 2nd Voice of Global South Summit, the Leaders' Sessions and each of the Ministerial Sessions. I think the underlying driver for that is that the development public infrastructure, the digital stack of India has interface with pretty much all segments of economy. So if you are looking at digitizing health initiatives that leads to better pandemic preparedness, delivery of vaccines, mapping of vulnerable populations for communicable or non-communicable diseases, then that is important. If you are looking at financing space, then the transparency in the development financing, transparency leading to removal of corruption in the financing space, it was discussed there. Payment initiatives, which brings about strong efficiencies in the delivery of governance. It costs less to the government and to the user to use digital payment modality. So each of these elements were discussed at some length in each of the Ministerial Sessions. And the objective essentially was that from our perspective, from Prime Minister's perspective, that look, this is something which is a capacity that India has built as per its initiatives, and India would be very happy to share it with the countries of the Global South. Again, in a manner that is sustainable and non-debt causing really. And there was almost a universal appreciation that India was willing to consider offering not just other capacities, but particularly the digital space where the intellectual property for the digital stack, the investments and the initiatives that have been taken in India are essentially all Indian..... But we are very happy to see if our progress in the space also leads to the progress and development of other countries. This was the driving sentiment of Prime Minister, which he spoke about in both Sessions. And I think countries, the leaders appreciated it deeply. On the energy transition and the financing, I mean, I can go into the specifics of what was talked about on energy transition. Two, three things were very particular to when the energy transition discussions took place. One, the nature for energy transition to be inclusive, affordable. And in a manner which makes the development sustainable. So, inclusive, affordable, just energy transition for sustainable development. That's a sort of broad parameter. But besides that, there was also a clear reference and the Indian Minister spoke about it very clearly; the need for...because for this, if you really want affordable and inclusive energy transition, you also need to have access to affordable finance & technology for achieving this energy transition across the Global South. This is not just a matter of India. While talking of energy, there was also a sense of gratitude expressed for India and Prime Minister to expand the reach of solar energy through the International Solar Alliance to the countries of the Global South. Reach means both the capacities, the technologies, the innovations, the processes, the systems that you would build to make a harnessing of solar energy more efficient in their respective countries. Our Leader, our Minister, also invited countries of the Global South to join the Global Biofuel Alliance in the Session. These were the broad subheads within the energy. I can go into the details, but I think you will find many of those, some of those, when we bring out the structured capturing of it tomorrow. Shri Arindam Bagchi, Official Spokesperson: Thank you very much, Sir. Thank you all for joining today evening. I want to thank also to Shri Kumaran and Shri Raghuram. Good evening. Shri Vinay Kwatra, Foreign Secretary: Thank you very much.  ",0.0,0.0

A new study published in the journalNature Communicationsshows that accounting for the long-term impacts of these storms raises the global social cost of carbon by more than 20%, compared to the estimates currently used for policy evaluations. This increase is mainly driven by the projected rise of tropical cyclone damages to the major economies of India, the U.S., China, Taiwan, and Japan under global warming.""Intense tropical cyclones have the power to slow down the economic development of a country for more than a decade, our analysis shows. Withglobal warming, the share of the most intense tropical cyclones is expected to increase so it becomes more likely that economies may not be able to recover fully in between storms,"" explains Hazem Krichene, author and scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) at the time the research was conducted.That is why long-term implications like reductions ineconomic growthcaused bytropical cyclonesmay harm economic development even stronger than the direct economic damage of the storms.The so-called social cost ofcarbonis a dollar estimate for future costs of societies resulting from the emission of one additional ton of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This key metric is widely used in policy evaluations, as it allows comparing the costs of climate change for societies with the costs of climate mitigation measures.""However, long-term effects of extreme events are not taken into account so far, so that current social cost of carbon estimates only reflect a part of the actual costs. This means that the real costs are probably even higher than currently estimated and the benefits of climate mitigation consequently underestimated,"" co-author Franziska Piontek from PIK says.Hotter climate, more intense tropical cyclones, higher costsFor their study the researchers analyzed the economic damages caused by these storms in 41 tropical-cyclone prone countries over the period from 1981 to 2015 and projected them for future global warming scenarios. In contrast to previous studies they thereby accounted for the mostly negative long-term impacts of these storms oneconomic development.The researchers found that these impacts increase the social cost of carbon by more than 20% globally (from 173 US$ to 212 US$ per ton CO2) and by more than 40% in the analyzed tropical-cycloneprone countries—compared to the social cost of carbon estimates currently used for policy evaluations.""When it comes toextreme events, much focus is put on immediate economic damages. However, it is as crucial to better quantify the overall costs of these events to inform societies upon the real costs of climate change and the climate impacts that can be avoided by effective climate action,"" concludes study author Christian Otto from PIK.",-1.0,0.0

Pitching for regulating such trade globally through creating an official carbon market, the CSE has sought negotiators to frame rules in such a way that the carbon credits must work for combating climate change as the issue is expected to figure prominently during COP28, scheduled to be held in Dubai from November 30 to December 12.The global market for carbon offsets falls under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement on climate change, adopted in 2015. Though countries agreed on a rulebook governing the carbon market during COP26 at Glasgow in 2021, the critical issues regarding necessary administrative infrastructure for the multilateral carbon credit market and accounting methodologies to avoid the risk of leakage and double counting remain unresolved.Ahead of the negotiations to fill these gaps by countries in Dubai, the CSE has highlighted many flaws of the existing voluntary carbon market in the Indian context through an investigation conducted by its researchers over the past six months.Its detailed investigative report - titled 'Discredited: The voluntary carbon market in India' - claimed to have covered 40 villages and towns across India to understand how the market works and found that though communities, their lands and their labour were central to the business/projects, such stakeholders were almost never aware that they were working to generate carbon credits. Besides, they had no rights of their own over those credits, it added. ""We wanted to find out if this market was working to benefit people and the planet. What we found was there is much that needs to be done...The carbon market should be a real market and not a secret pact between buyer and seller,” said Sunita Narain, director general, CSE, referring to findings of the investigation.Underlining the accountability issue in the absence of an official mechanism, the think tank flagged that the voluntary carbon markets currently operate without regulatory oversight, and lack uniformity and standardization.

If lost completely, the ice sheet would raise the global mean sea level by 5.3 metres or 17.4 feet — a potentially devastating consequence for millions of people living in vulnerable coastal cities across the world, including in India. Even under a best-case scenario of limiting global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, water inWest Antarcticawill continue to get warmer three times faster than in the 20th century, leading to an increased melting of the region’s ice sheet, the analysis has found. The study, ‘Unavoidable future increase in West Antarctic ice-shelf melting over the twenty-first century’, was published by the journal Nature last week. It was carried out by Kaitlin Naughten and Paul R Holland, both of whom work at the British Antarctic Survey, and Jan De Rydt of the Northumbria University (UK). An ice sheet is essentially a mass of glacial ice that covers more than 50,000 square kilometres of land — roughly large enough to blanket Uttarakhand in ice. There are two major ice sheets in the world today: Greenland ice sheet and Antarctica ice sheet. Together, they contain about two-thirds of all the freshwater on Earth “This means that over time, when ice sheets gain mass, they contribute to a fall in global mean sea level, and when they lose mass, they contribute to a rise in global mean sea level,” according to a report by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). There are various processes through which ice sheets melt. One of them is when warm ocean waters melt ice shelves — the edges of an ice sheet which floats on the ocean. Speaking toThe Indian Express, Naughten, one of the authors of the new study, explains: “Ice shelves stabilise the land-based glaciers just behind them. If an ice shelf thins or disappears, these glaciers tend to speed up, discharging more ice into the ocean and causing sea level rise.” Note that both ice shelves and ice sheets are different from sea ice, which is the free-floating ice that surrounds the polar regions. Sea ice is created by sea water freezing. The same process is taking place in West Antarctica, particularly the Amundsen Sea, which is the focus of Naughten’s study. For decades, the region’s ice shelves have been depleting, glaciers have been flowing faster towards the ocean and the ice sheet has been shrinking. To conduct the analysis, the scientists have used a high-resolution computer model of the Amundsen Sea to provide the most comprehensive assessment of warming in West Antarctica to date. They have used the model to run many different simulations of the 21st century, totalling over 4,000 years of ocean warming and ice-shelf melting in the Amundsen Sea. “We considered different trajectories for fossil fuel burning, from the best-case scenario where global warming is limited to 1.5°C in line with the Paris Agreement, to the worst, in which coal, oil and gas use is uncontrolled. We also considered the influence of natural variations in the climate, such as the timing of events such as El Niño,” the researchers write in an article published in The Conversation. The findings are grim. All scenarios show significant and widespread future warming of the Amundsen Sea and increased ice shelves melting. Moreover, there is little to no difference between the scenarios up to 2045. “Ocean warming and ice-shelf melting in the 1.5°C scenario is statistically the same as in a mid-range scenario, which is closer to what existing pledges to reduce fossil fuel use over the coming decades would produce,” the researchers add in their article. This will most likely lead to an increased sea level rise, which will affect coastal communities across the world, including in India. “India has a long coastline and a dense population and is therefore vulnerable to sea level rise. If coastal communities cannot afford to defend against the rising seas, for example by building walls, the people would have to move elsewhere or become refugees,” Naughten tells The Indian Express. Although the findings are bleak, they shouldn’t discourage the efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change, the study highlights. According to the researchers, the melting West Antarctic ice sheet is just one contributor to sea level rise, which is just one impact of climate change. “We have reached the point where some impacts of climate change can no longer be avoided, and substantial ice loss in West Antarctica is probably one of them. But, climate change is not all or nothing, and there are many other impacts which we can still avoid or limit: like the loss of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, or the severity of heatwaves, droughts, and extreme rainfall,” Naughten says.",-1.0,0.0

Research has shown that heat waves have become longer, hotter and more frequent over the last half a century because of human-induced climate change.The 2021 Pacific Northwestheatdome, the Central Plains' summer from hell the following year and this year's Southwest sizzler are the most familiar recent examples in this country. But extreme heat has touched every continent over the last few years: Temperatures have regularly exceeded 122° (50° Celsius) across the Asian subcontinent, and London's thermometers reached 104° (40°C) for the first time last year, much earlier than climate models predicted.But will such extended periods of heat and humidity come to regularly test the limits of human tolerance in places where much of the world's population lives? It could happen sooner than we think.We can study this question using the wet-bulb temperature, which combines the influence of heat and humidity on the human body. It denotes the temperature to which a parcel of air would cool by evaporating water into the environment, analogous to the cooling effect of sweat evaporating from skin.Scientists previously theorized that a wet-bulb temperature of 95°—equivalent to an air temperature of 95 at 100% relative humidity—was the highest at which humans could cool themselves without the aid of fans or air conditioning. But lab testing of young, healthy, non-heat-acclimated people at Pennsylvania State University indicated that the wet-bulb limit was closer to 88.Unfortunately, the hot spots for exceeding this wet-bulb temperature threshold include some of the most populous parts of the world: the Indus River Valley in India and Pakistan, eastern Asia, the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. These regions comprise many low- tomiddle-income countrieswith vulnerable populations that will bear the brunt of climate change even though they contributed relatively little to its causes.Ifglobal warming, currently at 1.2°C (2.2°F) above the preindustrial baseline, is kept to 1.5°C (2.7°F), the extent and duration of temperatures exceeding the threshold can be limited. At 3°C (5.4°F) of warming, however, the duration of exposure in the world's hot spots begins to increase exponentially, and physiologically intolerable conditions also begin to appear in the Americas.Breaking the wet-bulb temperature threshold once, it's worth noting, does not inherently make a place ""too hot for humans."" Chicago, for example, would experience an average of one hour a year above the threshold at 2° of warming, but one has to be exposed to these conditions for six continuous hours without taking precautions to reach dangerous core temperatures.On the other hand, at the same 2° of warming, the city of Hudaydah, Yemen, with a population of about 700,000, will experience an average of 340 hours a year of physiologically intolerable heat and humidity, putting the entire population at increased risk of dying. Divided into six-hour increments, that's equivalent to 56 days a year of these extreme conditions.Other populous globalhot spotsat 2° of warming would include Aden, Yemen, with about 34 days a year of such conditions; Dammam and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with 37 and eight days, respectively; Bandar Abbas and Ahvaz, Iran, with 29 and three; Lahore, Pakistan, with 24; Dubai, with 20; and Delhi and Kolkata, India, with six and five.Even in our current climate, extreme heat is already associated with dire health consequences. A Midwestern heat wave killed 700 people in Chicago in 1995. More than 70,000 died in Europe in the summer of 2003, and in 2010, 55,000 perished due to heat in Russia. More recently, an estimated 1,400 died across Oregon, Washington and British Columbia during the 2021 heat dome, and about 60,000 lost their lives due to extreme heat across Western Europe last year.Thousands more have probably lost their lives in theheat wavesthat have afflicted the Global South, where the lack of public health capacity and reporting obscures the toll. Vulnerable populations die not only of heatstroke but also of complications related to cardiovascular, respiratory and renal illnesses.The results of our study suggest that we need to prepare for, adapt to and mitigate extreme heat right now.How do we put the brakes on the worst consequences of extreme heat? During these ever-worsening summer heat waves, we can prevent heat-related illnesses by opening cooling centers, monitoring vulnerable communities and shifting high-exertion activities to cooler parts of the day. To better prepare for future heat waves, we should also invest in adaptation and mitigation measures to deal with the warming that past emissions have already baked into our future climate.Ultimately, a global effort to reduce the use of fossil fuels and bring net carbon emissions to zero as quickly as possible is the only way to avoid intolerable conditions for billions.Daniel Vecellio is a postdoctoral research scholar at George Mason University's Virginia Climate Center.

The future of fossil … [+4672 chars]",Weather,"Plans to expand oil, gas and coal production by major fossil fuel countries would push the world far beyond the Paris deal's 1.5C global warming limit, the UN warned Wednesday. The future of fossil fuels will be a key flashpoint when world leaders meet at the COP28 climate conference later this month, tasked with salvaging the world's agreed temperature thresholds. Most of the world's leading producers of fossil fuels have pledged to achieve ""net-zero"" emissions by midcentury -- a target that should align with the Paris Agreement's aims to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the pre-industrial era, and preferably a safer 1.5C. But the annual United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Production Gap report makes it clear that the production plans of the top 20 producing countries -- including the United States, China, Russia, Australia and COP28 host United Arab Emirates -- are heading in the opposite direction. Overall it found that governments' plans would produce 110 percent more fossil fuels  in 2030  than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5C, and 69 percent more than would be consistent with 2C. ""Governments' plans to expand fossil fuel production are undermining the energy transition needed to achieve net-zero emissions, throwing humanity's future into question,"" said Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director. ""Starting at COP28, nations must unite behind a managed and equitable phase-out of coal, oil and gas -- to ease the turbulence ahead and benefit every person on this planet."" Burning fossil fuels is by far the main cause of climate change, accounting for most of the planet-heating carbon pollution driving global warming and the ensuing barrage of temperature records, devastating weather disasters and sea level rise. But countries have been reluctant to officially acknowledge this in global climate negotiations, and even the Paris Agreement does not explicitly talk about how to reach the targets it sets. That has led to a ""large discrepancy"" between governments' production plans and the need to rapidly move away from fossil fuels to meet global climate goals, said Ploy Achakulwisut, a lead author on the UNEP report and Stockholm Environment Institute scientist. The UNEP report covers 20 countries that account for 82 percent of production and 73 percent of consumption of the world's fossil fuel supply. It found that planned increases in production in these countries would produce 460 percent more coal, 82 percent more gas, and 29 percent more oil than would be in line with the 1.5C limit. The report said the United States -- the top oil and gas producer globally -- has encouraged accelerated domestic production of oil and gas since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, even as it ramped up climate policies. US authorities forecast oil production will reach and remain at ""record high levels"" from 2024 to 2050, with gas production continuously increasing, the report said. Meanwhile, UNEP said the world's biggest emitter China produces just over half of the world's supply of coal, the most polluting of the fossil fuels. Its domestic coal production reached a record in 2022 of around 4.5 billion tonnes, the report said, adding that production was expected to peak this decade. China, the world leader in renewable power, is committed to peaking emissions by 2030 and becoming carbon-neutral by 2060. Two years ago at the COP26 meeting in Glasgow countries agreed to ""phase-down unabated coal power"", the first time a fossil fuel had been explicitly mentioned in the negotiated agreement. Abated generally means to capture emission before they go into the atmosphere. UNEP hailed that pledge as a ""significant milestone"" but noted that since then production and use of fossil fuels have ""reached record high levels"". Fossil fuels and the emissions they cause are expected to dominate at the meeting in oil-rich UAE from November 30 to December 12. The incoming COP28 president Sultan Al Jaber, who also leads the state-owned oil firm ADNOC, has said phasing down all fossil fuels is ""inevitable and essential"". But the UAE has no concrete policies to support a ""managed wind-down"" of its own fossil fuels, the UNEP report found, noting plans by ADNOC to boost oil production capacity by 2027 as part of a $150 billion investment plan. The report ""exposes the glaring hypocrisy at the heart of global climate action"", said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, calling for wealthy polluters to lead by example. Achakulwisut told AFP that many countries had used the conflict in Ukraine to double down on fossil fuels, but said a more durable solution for the climate and economy was the transition to clean energy. ""What our society needs is energy, it's not fossil fuels,"" she said.",-1.0,0.0

The region is accounting for 52.5 per cent of global capacity in 2022 -- driven largely by  India ,  China  and  Vietnam . Asian investments in the electric car and scooter market are also notable with sales of electric motorbikes and scooters in the country increasing 3,000 per cent between 2015-2022. Globally, Asia accounts for 51 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions with vast coal fleets in India and China despite both countries committing to long-term net-zero targets. The new study that highlights the Asian region as the global leader in wind and solar development coincides with government leaders, businesses and civil society organisations gathering in the southern Malaysian city of Johor Bahru this week to enhance cooperation and discuss climate solutions in Asia and the Pacific. The report 'A driving force: Asia's Energy Transition' is the third in a series of reports looking at evidence of the pace of growth in the clean energy transition. The report builds on several pieces of research on exponential systems change released by RMI, Systems Change Lab and others this year, which shows that change is happening faster than we think. Its key takeaways include Asia has the fastest growth rate of wind and solar capacity at 35 per cent per year, and it has outpaced other continents since 2015. Total Asian funding for renewables amounted to $532 billion in 2022, that's 65 per cent of the global spend on renewables. India's growth in renewable capacity outpaces coal power growth while China had the fastest growing deployment of wind and solar in the world between 2000 and 2022, doubling its wind capacity about every 1.5 years and its solar capacity about every 2.5 years. The Asia Pacific Region -- home to 4.3 billion people and one of the regions most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change -- is grappling with various climate challenges, including sea level rise, extreme weather events, and threats to its biodiversity and water resources. Responding to the report, Aarti Khosla, Director, Carbon Copy, said: ""Asian economies like India, China and Japan are becoming all the more pivotal for global growth especially as the Asian continent is set to contribute about two-thirds of all global growth."" ""As domestic energy consumption will increase off the back of major infrastructure developments and large manufacturing pushes clean energy should be the crux of development. This will assume even greater significance, especially with global energy security threatened with defence issues, as well as economic difficulties being faced by many countries across the world."" Li Shuo, incoming China Climate Hub Director, Asia Society Policy Institute, said: ""China is racing ahead in the shift to clean energy, this is no small feat for the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases."" ""Since the Paris Agreement, China's renewables capacity has soared and we know it's expected to surpass its goal to increase solar and wind capacity to over 1,200 GW by 2030. The country is not immune to climate impacts and must use its own momentum to spearhead an ambitious global deal at COP28."" Experience Your Economic Times Newspaper, The Digital Way!

This Moscone Center is   about as big as my state.  (Laughter.) This is a city of —   synonymous with innovation and breaking barriers, where collaboration   and coming together have always been key to unlocking our potential.    It's a city that has been shaped by centuries of deep ties to the   Asia-Pacific region and by contributions of people of Asian and Pacific   Island heritage. So, San Francisco is a natural place to gather   to innovate and collaborate for the 2023 APEC Summit, the CEO Summit,   and all the events we're — taking place this week. And I want   to to talk — I want to thank everyone who has made this week possible,   especially those serving on APEC's Executive Secretariat, APEC Business   Advisory Council, the National Center for APEC, and so many others. Today,   21 APEC economies make up more than 60 percent — more than 60 percent   of the global GDP.  We're almost half the global trade.  The   Asia-Pacific is projected to be the largest contributor of global growth   over the next 30 years. So, the vision we pursue for the   economic future of our region will rebound far beyond the Asia-Pacific.    The choices we make are going to matter — it's not hyperbole to suggest   — for the entire world. It's up to us to harness the dynamism   of our economies and tap the entrepreneu- — entrepreneurial spirit of   our people and unleash the potential — the unlimited potential of our   partnerships in order to realize a future that will benefit people not   only in the Asia-Pacific region but the whole world, and I mean that   sincerely — people everywhere.  A future where our prosperity is shared   and is inclusive, where workers are empowered and their rights are   respected, where our economies are sustainable and resilient, and the   bridges that connect our people open a golden gate of opportunity to   create lives of hope. Just lives of hope.  Most people are just — just hope.You know, that's been my approach here in the United States from the moment my administration took office. We're   building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up.  The   trickle-down economy worked okay sometimes, but not a whole lot trickled   down to my dad's kitchen table. But when the middle class does well, the poor have a chance and the   wealthy still do very well.  Because what happens — the poor have a   ladder up, the middle class and the wealthy still do well. Folks, we're already seeing the results. The last quarter,   the American economy grew 4.9 percent — the highest growth rate in two   years.  More people in the United States — (applause) — because of many   of you sitting here, the CEOs — (laughter) — let's give credit where   it's due — more people in the United States are in the workforce today   than at any time in American history. Our unemployment has been   under 4 percent for 21 straight months.  Inflation has come down by 65   percent.  More to do.  We now have the lowest inflation of any — the   lowest inflation rate of any advanced economy in the world.  And   meanwhile, median household wealth has grown by 37 percent in real terms   since before the pandemic. I acknowledge there's a disconnect   between the numbers and how people feel about their place in the world   right now, and we can deal with the second part as well.  We still have   work to do, but our model for growing is delivering real results for all   Americans — significant Black unemployment, Latino unemployment, et   cetera. The strength of our economy is driving growth and spurring investment   throughout our entire region — and, again, because of many of you   sitting in front of me made those judgements.  And it's drawing   investments to the United States, especially from Asia-Pacific   economies. Since the start of my administration, companies from   across the Asia-Pacific have invested over $200 billion in the United   States.  These are historic investments, creating literally tens of   thousands of good-paying jobs.  We're — 14 million created just since we   came to office all across America in the industries that are going to   shape the future of this globe: semiconductors, electric vehicles,   batteries, critical materials, hydrogen hubs, and other critical and   emerging technologies. I've long said: It's never been a good   bet to bet against the American people.  Never.  (Applause.)  No, I mean   it.  Think about it.  It's never been a good bet, and we're proving it   once more. So, my message to all of you here today is: Leaders   of government and industry, you can count on the United States.  We're   delivering on our promises and we're doubling down on our progress.    We'll soon — we'll soon be your strong and steady partner as we continue   working together to realize the Asia-Pacific region that is free and   open, prosperous and secure, resilient and connected. By the   way, twice since I've been president, I've had the leaders of the   Asia-Pacific Islands come to meet with me in the United States.  They're   all part of it. I thought when I left the G20 and Vietnam   desperately wanted to see me and raise the relationship, it brought me   back when I stood in front of that monument to John McCain — all my days   growing up, I never thought that would ever occur. Today, I'd   like to talk a little about the work we've done in the region to get   there and how we're going to go about seeing this road forward. I've said for a long time: The United States is a Pacific power. I   had that brief discussion yesterday with President Xi.  He asked why we   so — he had asked me before; I reminded him why I — we are so engaged   in the Pacific.  It's because we're a Pacific nation.  And because of   us, there's been peace and security in the region, allowing you to   grow.  He didn't disagree. By the way, it was a very good, straightforward meeting. We   aren't going anywhere.  For decades, America's enduring commitment to   the region has been a springboard that's enabled growth — transformative   growth, ensured the open flow of commerce, and lifted millions of   people out of poverty. Today, that relationship goes both   ways.  The United States remains vital to the future of the region, and   the region is more vital than ever to the United States of America. That's been my administration's outlook from day one, and we clearly laid out our approach with our Indo-Pacific Strategy. We are delivering across the board, including when it comes to our shared economic agenda. The   United States has deep ties with our fellow APEC economies.  More than   60 percent of U.S. exports go to fellow APEC economies.  Robust, two-way   investment between the United States and APEC countries supports good   jobs and new opportunities all across the region. And American   businesses — significantly represented here in this auditorium — are the   largest source of foreign direct investment into APEC economies.  In   fact, if we take just the U.S. companies represented here at this summit   and look at their new investments [into] APEC economies in the calendar   year, it totaled more than $50 billion so far. Investments   announced today from co- — from companies like Amazon, United, Delta,   Microsoft to make sure our region is more inclusive and interconnected. Investments   announced today from companies like Boeing, Apple, Flexport, and   Pepsi-Cola — the Pepsi company, I should say — to make our economies   greener and more sustainable. Investments today from companies   like IBM, Organon, Visa — look, they make up — they make our region more   resilient and ma- — you all make it more secure. Here in this   world — this world-renowned hub of innovation, leading — leading tech   companies like Anthropic and — I'm going to mispronounce — I'm not going   to even try.  (Laughter.)  It's better not to try and not mispronounce   than try and mispronounce.  (Laughter.) The point is: Small- and medium-sized businesses and startups are getting into action as well. All   of the announcements translate into real country — real outcomes that   matter to people's lives.  They're proof that a strong, dynamic American   economy is an engine of growth — economic growth and innovation   throughout the entire region. And they're testament to the fact   that American investment and American ingenuity are in high demand all   across the region.  Because when you do business with the United States   and our companies, you know what you're getting: high standards, fair   practices, protections for workers, world-class ideas and innovation,   and a commitment to deal with the environment, finally.  It's a quality   guarantee. Look, this is how we've been able to mobilize   billions in investment, including major new announcements this morning   through our Partnership for Global In- — Infrastructure and Investment. We   also worked closely to deepen our bilateral economic cooperation with   partners throughout the region, especially on the issues that will most   impact our future economic success. For example, in September   when I traveled to Vietnam, as I mentioned earlier, to mark a historic   new phase in our partnership of our countries, we committed to work   together to strengthen the semiconductor supply chain. With   India, Japan, Republic of Korea, and Singapore, we've launched new   initiatives to shape the technologies and standards that will transform   the future. We've deepened economic partnership with the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, and others. We've renewed and elevated our engagement with critical regional bodies, including ASEAN and the Pacific Islands Forum. And   when we — and when we offered to host APEC two years ago, we committed   to modernizing this institution to make it easier for us to work   together as we take on the challenges of a new era.  And there are many   challenges. We're going to see more changes in the next 10 years than we've seen in the last 50 years. That   brings me back to the summit and where we go from here.  The world is   fundamentally different than it was 30 years ago at the first annual   APEC Leaders' Meeting at Blake Island in Washington State. The   questions we must answer today are not about how much we trade, but   about how we build resilience, lift up working people, reduce carbon   emissions, and set up our economies to succeed over the long run.  How   to deliver growth from the bottom up and the middle out so no one gets   left behind. And the idea behind this new Indo-Pacific Economic   Framework — a partnership among 14 diverse and dynamic nations, all   committed to tackling urgent issues like pandemic response, vulnerable   supply chains, climate change, and natural disasters, which we have   learned can gravely impact our economies. We've announced the   framework in May of 2022.  And later today, we are launching an   important new tool to promote sustainable economic growth and create a   race to the top, not the bottom. They are tangible commitments   negotiated in record time that are going to deliver meaningful outcomes —   meaningful outcomes to make supply chains more resilient, facilitate   clean-energy transition, and fight corruption. For example, our   new supply chain agreement will allow us to better monitor for supply   chain challenges before they become the kind of full-scale disruptions   we saw during the COVID-19 pandemic and to ensure we're better prepared   to shift and adapt when disruptions do occur.  And they will. I   know you all know better than I our work is not yet done.  This   framework will be a platform for ongoing economic cooperation.  And we   will continue working to better facilitate high-standard trade that   advances workers' rights through strong enforceable of labor standards. And   every step — at every step, we have upheld our commitment to unions.    Each of the framework pillars includes strong, pro-labor outcomes that   will benefit workers of all economies. It's critical to building a stronger, fairer, more resilient economy for families across the Indo-Pacific. This   week, my administration has launched our new Global Labor Strategy to   ensure that workers' rights are the centerpiece of our economic strategy   internationally, as well as domestically.  That's a primary concern to   me. Last week in Illinois, I congratulated the UAW on their record contract with the Big Three U.S. auto companies. The   contract is going to lead to thousands of new jobs, billions of dollars   in plant investment to keep American auto industry strong and   competitive. And I urge any company investing in America to   enter into partnerships with the most highly skilled, dedicated, and   engaged workers anywhere in the world: American labor. And,   folks, I asked the Treasury Department to do a study: When labor does   well, what does that do to people all o- — all over — non-labor folks   around the country?  Everyone benefits. And, by the way, the   reason many of you use labor is because they're the best workers in the   world.  Union.  It's not like you show up one day and say, ""I want to be   an electrician.""  You show up one day and they say, ""You got five years   to practice.""  And then you get a card. I'm also intent on   responsibly managing the competition between the United States and the   People's Republic of China.   That's what we talked a little bit about   yesterday — President Xi and I.  That's what the world expects of us.    And I promise you, that's what we're doing. I met with Xi   yesterday, leader to leader, to make sure there is no miscommunication   between us.  As always — and I've met with him more than any other world   leader, because when I was Vice President, it was concluded that I   should get to know him.  It wasn't appropriate for the President of the   United States to be meeting with the Vice President. We've had,   prior to this, 68 hours of private meetings just he and I, each with a   simultaneous interpreter.  Our discussions have always been candid and   constructive.  I again emphasized to President Xi that the United States   does not seek conflict. And yesterday, we announced resumption   of military-to-military communication channels to reduce the risk of   accidental miscalculation.  And it exists.  (Applause.) This is   not — as my generation would say back in the day, this is not all   ""Kumbaya.""  But it's straightforward.  It's straightforward.  We have   real differences with Beijing when it comes to maintaining fair and   level economic playing field and protecting your intellectual property.    We're going to continue to address them with smart policies and strong   diplomacy. We've also taken targeted action to protect our vital national security interest. But   let me be clear: We are de-risking and diversifying our econ- —   economic relationship with the PRC, not decoupling.  Not decoupling.    We'll be firm in standing up for our values and our interests.  And I   was very straightforward, as he was with me yesterday. At the   same time, on critical global issues such as climate, AI,   counternarcotics, where it makes sense to work together, we've committed   to work together.  We're going to continue our commitment to diplomacy   to avoid surprises and prevent misunderstandings. A stable   relationship between the world's two largest economies is not merely   good for those two economies but for the world — a stable relationship.    It's good for everyone.  (Applause.) Let me close with this.    The Leaders' Statement from that first Blake Island summit 30 years ago   captured a shared commitment to, quote, ""deepening the spirit of   community,"" end of quote, among our economies.  For all that has changed   over the past three decades, we have to continue to summon the spirit   of community to meet the challenges of today and to seize the enormous   possibilities that exist. My staff is tired of hearing me say   this for the last I don't know how many years: The world is at an   inflection point where the decisions we make today — this is not   hyperbole — are going to shape the direction of the world for decades to   come — for decades to come.  Just think of AI. That's   particularly true in the Asia-Pacific, where so much of the future of   our world will be written.  And I would argue, each of us has a play —   has a part to play in writing that future together. So, today, I   challenge all of us to measure our successes not based on the bottom   lines of our balance sheets but by the lives we lift up through our   investments, the potential we unleash with our innovation, and the   ability to continue to talk with one another. Let's build a   global economy where everyone has a chance to succeed and workers have a   fair shot, a fair share of the value they create. The United   States is stepping up because of many of you in this room.  We're not   talking the talk; we're backing it up with commitments.  And we're going   to see us — you're going to see us follow through. So, I want   to thank you again for joining us in San Francisco; thank you for your   commitment to APEC and the future of the Pacific — Asia-Pacific region;   and thank you for everything you've already done to make this summit a   success. We can do more. God bless you all.  Thank you.  (Applause.) 11:41 A.M. PST   ",1.0,0.0

I was waiting out there for the tide to subside. Welcome.  Welcome to our first APEC leaders' session.  I really appreciate the fact that you're all here.  And thank you.  And I hope the city has been good to you. And earlier this morning, I spoke with the — at the CEO Summit.  And I said that our world stands at an inflection point — a point where the decisions we make now are going to determine the course of the world, not just a few of our countries, for the next several decades — of consequence. Nowhere is that more true than when it comes to climate.  Every economy around this table faces this challenge — every one of us.  And as I've said before, it's the only existential threat to humanity.  We either get this right or there's not going to be a whole lot of people around to talk about it. Every economy has seen signs of what's to come if we don't act — droughts, floods, seas rising, temperatures rising, and more and more unpredictable weather patterns, and more un- — more and more unpredictable markets. As a region, were responsible for the largest share — the region we're talking about here around this circular table, we're responsible for the largest share of global emissions, so we must also bear responsibility for the solutions while we still have time to change course. Earlier this week, I released the Fifth U.S Climate Assessment, mapping out what we've done and how far we have left to go. But the fact is, it's only together that we're going to be able to make any real progress.  Any one of us who gets to zero emissions, it's not going to change the world; we have to do it together.  Only together can we keep the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius within our reach. Here at home, I'm proud to say the United States is doing our part. One year ago, I signed what we called the Inflation Reduction Act — the largest investment in the climate fight ever, anywhere in the world. Two years ago, I signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law — the biggest investment in infrastructure in American history, including what we call our ""clean power"" sector. And over the last three years, we've helped mobilize more than half a trillion dollars in private sector investment, including to scale up technologies like offshore wind, advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, direct air capture, and more. These investments not only put the United States on track to achieve our 1.5 degree alignment goal — aligned goal by cutting emissions by 50 percent by 2030, they're creating jobs — good-paying jobs, jobs you can raise a family on.  And they're helping lower the cost of clean energy and climate technologies for nations around the world by as much as 25 percent in some areas. But we can't stop here.  We have so much more work to do. You all know as well as I do the impacts of climate change are being felt most by those who have contributed the least to the problem.  Let me say that again: You know the impacts of climate change are being felt the most by those countries that contribute the least to the problem, including developing countries. We contributed a lot here in the United States over the year — the last 300 years.  That's why I'm working with our Congress to dramatically increase international climate financing. And this year, the world is on track to meet the climate finance pledge that we made under the Paris Agreement of $100 billion collectively. I've also asked Congress for another $25 billion to strengthen the role of the multilateral development banks in fighting the climate crisis as well as — as well as starting with the World Bank.  Because climate security, energy security, and food security — they're all related, as all of you know.  I'm not telling you anything you don't already know. On top of this, we focused on ending deforestation.  Forests are key to our future. In the United States alone, they absorb 10 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions as they stand today. We're also working with partners around the table to mobilize $1 billion to conserve the Amazon and other critical ecosystems in Latin America.  You know, the Amazon is a great carbon sink; it absorbs more carbon from the air on a daily basis than the United States emits on a daily basis.  And it should be preserved, and they need help in doing it. The United States also ratified the — the Kigali Amendment, which will drastically produc- — reduce the production of super potent hi- — HFCs. And finally, the Global Methane Pledge we launched two years ago together with just seven other countries and the European Union has grown to include 150 countries. And here at home, the United States is turning this pledge into progress.  We're investing more than $20 billion in methane mitigation to do things like plugging leaks throughout our oil and gas sectors.  All told, in 2023, these steps, if finalized, will reduce methane emissions from covered sources by 87 percent below the 2005 levels. I encourage everyone around this table to also take strong national actions, because as that — as I said earlier, it will take all of us to meet this moment. With the right commitments from every economy here, we can limit — we can limit warming, we can build new energy futures and leave no one behind, and we can turn — we can turn this moment into a great — from great peril into a moment of great possibility. And the moment where we stood together to protect our people and preserve our planet for future generations — that's the moment we're at right now.  That's the chance we have.  That's what this session is all about. I'm looking forward to hearing directly from each of you about your climate needs and priorities, what help you may need as well.  And I'm looking forward to finding new ways to maximize our impact. And now, I'd ask the press to depart, which will only take about two minutes, I'm sure.  No, we'll ask the press to depart. And I'm going to turn it over to Secretary Kerry, my Special Envoy on Climate, so we can get that conversation going. And thank you. 12:52 P.M. PST  ",1.0,1.0

Th… [+6566 chars]",Uganda,"As we navigate an era of rapid transformations, being able to lead through disruption is essential. By Francois Bonnici, Head of Foundations, World Economic Forum The world is facing a series of disruptions that will fundamentally alter our lives: transitioning to net-zero, nature-positive world, a fracturing global political order, the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to name a few. How we navigate these changes will depend in large part on who leads us — in our organizations, communities and society at large. But the definition of good leadership itself is, in many ways, changing as societies and organizations grapple with complex challenges that give rise to increased scrutiny on ethical, inclusive and sustainable practices. However, research by Deloitte shows that just 23% of employees believe their organization’s leaders currently have the capabilities necessary to manage in a disrupted, boundaryless world. This perceived lack of readiness may stem from a misunderstanding of the implications of and opportunities in the new world we are entering. Therefore, it is crucial for leaders to cultivate three key competencies: adaptability, cross-cultural understanding and forward-thinking. Since its inception in 2004, the Forum of Young Global Leaders has offered a platform for leaders to experiment with fresh ideas and strategize solutions. Its unique three-year leadership development programme fosters a culture of diversity and collaboration, equipping future leaders with the necessary skills to excel in an increasingly complex world. Below are three ways leaders can develop these skills: Harness adaptability The pace of change is only accelerating, and disruptions are becoming more common. Leaders need to be adaptable and able to pivot their strategies in response to changing circumstances. For example, Victor Ochen, a Young Global Leader (YGL) and Nobel Prize nominee, exemplifies adaptability in his approach to driving change. His work, ranging from Uganda to Ukraine, is steeped in a commitment to healing the traumas of war. His organization, the African Youth Initiative Network, has provided crucial psychological support to over 21,000 individuals affected by violence. Demonstrating a remarkable ability to adapt his experience and knowledge to new contexts, Ochen has expanded his reach beyond Africa. He spearheaded a pan-African initiative to mobilize psychologists and other conflict responders to aid in Ukraine. “We are brothers, as Africans. We are stepping forward to help our brothers and sisters who are caught up in conflict in Europe, especially in Ukraine,” says Ochen. Through his work, Ochen highlights that being able to apply learnings to changing contexts is not just a valuable skill for leaders in today's era of disruption, but an essential one. Embrace lifelong learning Lifelong learning breeds innovation. Leaders who make it a priority to consistently seek knowledge are more likely to generate novel ideas and solutions. YGL Mariana Vasconcelos leveraged her love for learning to help farmers connect technology with agriculture. As the CEO and co-founder of Brazil-based AgroSmart — the largest agricultural data network in Latin America, Vasconcelos developed a platform that collects and processes data to generate insights that support 100,000 farmers in making data-driven decisions and overcoming the uncertainty of climate and climate change. Its network of farmers aggregates information that continuously improves the quality of the insights provided and supports companies in the whole-food system to transition to a more productive, sustainable and climate-resilient supply chain. “Growing up in an agricultural family and handling food from farm to table, I developed a passion for food systems. It translated into the creation of AgroSmart. My daily duties include interacting with the market, investors, corporate clients, entrepreneurs, and stakeholders, by which I constantly update my knowledge and build upon our vision and strategy,” says Vasoncelos. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and curiosity, Vasconcelos harnessed technology and data to enhance farming practices. This underscores how leaders committed to continuous learning can stay ahead of the curve, driving innovation that can disrupt entire industries. Build a culture of collaboration In times of rapid change and disruption, leaders must foster a culture of collaboration, encouraging diverse perspectives and shared learning to generate innovative solutions. For example, YGLs Neema Kaseje, Humanitarian Surgeon and Health Leader at Médecins Sans Frontières, Guillaume Lefèvre, Head of Brokers Channel & Customers Commercial Insurance, Zurich Insurance Group and H.R.H. Jaime de Bourbon de Parme, Climate Envoy for the Netherlands Government, recently unveiled a plan to revolutionize health services in rural and refugee communities. Using digital technology, including AI and machine learning, they aim to eliminate inefficiencies and optimize surgical procedures, while also promoting environmental sustainability and health equity. With the goal of improving health access and reducing costs, this coalition is working to create a brighter future for those in need of life-saving care. Similarly, one group of YGLs have launched the 1t.org India Coalition, to support the country's commitment to restore 26 million hectares of deforested land and sequester 2.5-3 billion tons of CO2 equivalent by 2030. Led by YGL Bhairavi Jani, Executive Director of SCA Group of Companies, the coalition is working closely with the World Economic Forum to help mitigate the effects of climate change, water scarcity and loss of topsoil in India. This restoration is critical for the livelihoods of India's 700 million rural inhabitants who depend on forests and agriculture. Fostering a culture of collaboration and shared learning in times of rapid change and disruption is more than a leadership approach — it's a tool for generating solutions with far-reaching impact. Leaders like Ochen, Vasconcelos and the many other YGLs in our community embody what is essential for leaders in a changing world. They are empathetic and have experience: on the ground, working side-by-side and in their communities. They understand the challenges the world faces, but they are not intimidated by them. They see opportunity in them. Whether it is using AI to help farmers and reimagine the food system, or using digital technologies to revolutionize health services in rural and refugee communities, these leaders share the ability to identify opportunities in disruption and affect positive change. That is what we need from our leaders today and moving forward.",1.0,0.0

That's just one of a set of seemingly contradictory conditions facing climate negotiators who this week gather in Dubai for marathon  United Nations  talks that include a first-ever assessment of how well the world is doing in its battle against  global warming .   It's also a conference where one of the central topics will be whether fossil fuels should be phased out, but it will be run by the CEO of an oil company.   Key to the session is the first ""global stocktake"" on climate, when countries look at what's happened since the 2015 Paris climate agreement, how off-track it is and probably say what's needed to get back on track.   Even though emissions of heat-trapping gases are still rising every year, they're rising more slowly than projected from 2000 to 2015. Before the Paris deal, scientists at Climate Action Tracker and the United Nations Environment Programme were projecting about 3.5 degrees Celsius (6.3 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming over pre-industrial levels based on how much carbon dioxide countries were spewing and what they planned to do about it.   That 3.5 ""is totally out of the picture. It will not happen,"" said NewClimate Institute scientist Niklas Hohne, who works on Climate Action Tracker. ""Our number is 2.7 (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit). It could be even lower with pledges and with net zero targets.""    UNEP 's Emissions Gap projected 2.5 to 2.9 degrees (4.5 to 5.2 degrees Fahrenheit). The global goal is 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).   Countries are promising and even starting on actions that should eventually reduce emissions, but those cuts haven't materialised yet, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, also of Climate Action Tracker.   ""So things aren't as bad as they could have been or as we worried they might be 20 years ago, but they're still far from where we need to be,"" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads scientists who annual track world emissions in the Global Carbon Project.   When he looks at the impacts of just 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming - about what the world has gotten so far - World Resources Institute CEO Ani Dasgupta said he wants to scream from the rooftops about how ""unfair and unequal the devastation is.""   ""No one who has half a brain can be happy where we are,"" Dasgupta said.   Scientists underestimated for decades how much destruction just a little warming would cause, several scientists said. And that damage we are feeling far outweighs the gains made in reducing future warming projections, they said.   Hare points to more than 60,000 heat deaths in Europe in 2022. Others point to thousands dead from flooding in Pakistan and Libya.   ""The more we know, the more severe impacts we see at lower temperature changes,"" said Anne Olhoff, chief author of the UNEP Emissions Gap report. ""The impacts happen much faster than we thought previously and much harder than we thought previously.""   The damage the world is seeing ""is scarier to me than almost anything else,"" Jackson said. ""We are seeing the world's weather start to unravel and there's no evidence that that will stop.""   When it comes to emissions, the key is what's causing them, experts say, citing fossil fuels.   ""I think rightly the fundamental role of fossil fuels will take center stage"" at the Dubai negotiations, called ""COP"" for conference of parties, said Melanie Robinson, climate director for World Resources Institute.   Heading into negotiations, world leaders have crowed about tentative agreements to triple the amount of renewable energy use and double energy efficiency. But that's not enough, said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research.   ""It requires the tearing out the poisoned root of the climate crisis: fossil fuels,"" said United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.   Guterres, numerous climate scientists and environmental activists all say what's needed is a phase-out - or at the very least a phase-down - of coal, oil and gas.   But the host country runs the negotiations and appoints a president. The host country is the oil state United Arab Emirates and it has named ADNOC oil company CEO Sultan al-Jaber, who also runs a renewable energy company, as the conference president. Al-Jaber and his colleagues say by bringing fossil fuel companies to the table they can get more done and that it may take someone in the industry to get the concessions needed.   Environmental activists don't believe it.   ""We cannot trust these politicians and we cannot trust the processes of the COPs because the fossil fuel industries are tightening their grip around their processes and dictating their outcomes,"" youth environmental activist Greta Thunberg said.   The process is in the hands of parties or nations and because of the COP rules it has to be by consensus or practically unanimous so that makes a phase-out of fossil fuels agreement unlikely, but a ""phase-down of fossil fuels is inevitable,"" said Adnan Amir, the UAE's No.2 official for the climate talks.   ""There are many different views on the fossil fuels language from many different parties and how exactly we will land it will be about how we get the right formulation,'' said  COP28  Director-General Majid Al Suwaidi. ""I think the sentiment is all the same. The language here that we're seeing between parties is really much closer than we've seen in the past.""   New Climate Institute's Hohne said a phase-out is needed but doesn't think  Al Jaber  will allow it: ""He would basically have to agree that the basis of his business model of his company would be eliminated.""   Hohne, Hare, Dasgupta and others look at al-Jaber and others' heavy promotion of carbon capture and storage - technology that the scientists say hasn't proven itself -- and they worry that the climate talks will look like something significant has been accomplished when it actually hasn't.   ""I think there's a high risk that it (negotiations) ends up in greenwashing, in just looking nice but not leading to much,"" Hohne said.   Activists and even United Nations officials also said they are disturbed by countries pointing to their efforts to reduce coal and increase renewable energy, as they also approve new oil and gas drilling projects, especially after Russia invaded Ukraine.   A report by the activist Centre for Biological Diversity said that while new efforts by the Biden Administration in its Inflation Reduction Act would reduce nearly 1 billion metric tons of carbon emissions by 2030, 17 different oil and gas projects it has approved would add 1.6 billion metric tons of emissions.   ""Governments can't keep pledging to cut commitments to cut emissions under the Paris Agreement and then greenlighting huge fossil fuel projects,"" UNEP Director Inger Andersen said.

Welcome home! I think it is the sober way of welcoming you because the gravity of the moment does not give much space for flamboyance or rhetoric. It is good that you come here to this Ambassador's Conference to discuss, to see each other, to engage with the staff in Brussels. We can be proud to be one of the largest diplomatic corps and network in the world, [on which] the European Union institutions rely. It will [last] one week. It shows that it is not just a formal exercise, but [meant] to go deeper into discussion. I will not be with you the whole week and maybe not even on Friday because I have been called to go somewhere else in the world and particularly to the Middle East, and you may understand. It is clear that we are living in troubled times. When I presented the Strategic Compass, almost two years ago, I said ""Europe is in danger"". It was before the start of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. It was before the major current crisis in Sahel. It was before the flare-up of the conflict in Israel and Palestine. And certainly, I think that we will agree that I do not remember a time when I could say that Europe is in danger and facing so great challenges. We have seen the explosion of violence and rivalry, together with the climate and ecological crisis which aggravate the security risks with countries in the region, and in some places [it is] becoming unbearable. People cannot live in some places in our neighborhood due to climate change. So, the coming months will be for sure - the coming months, not the coming years, will be for sure a moment for defining a global peace and the future of the world, and for the security and the global credibility of the European Union. Let me start by talking about this event. Dear colleagues, dear Ambassadors, This is a moment in which we have to have a look at the world disorder and to try to look for references that go beyond the classical wording on disorder and crisis. In order to have these stuck with you, I try to put my ideas in order, getting away from the phones and from the daily events and the never-ending flow of news, which are most of them rather depressing. The first conclusion that I got from my thinking on these days is that, more and more, we are living in a world characterised by greater multipolarity and [less] multilateralism. The world is full of poles, not all of them are equal. We are very far away from the world of the 19th century following the Vienna Congress, when five European powers steered the world. And multipolarity is not only referred to military capability and wealth. It is not only the military and the economy, it is also about the thinking, about different truths and different approaches to the world. It is clear that in strategic terms, we have to cope with two big superpowers. They are not fully at par yet - the United States and China. But look, when China opened to the world in the middle of the seventies, it [represented] 1% of the United States' GDP - 1%. And today, it is 80% of the United States' GDP. Amazing, no? In such a short time, from 1% to 80%. This is going to mark this new bipolarity. It is going to mark our future. But there are other poles. There are other poles. In fact, there are maybe a dozen of poles which are strong and indispensable regional actors - and we are one of them. We are in an intermediate position. We are not a full-fledged great power. We are not a military alliance. We are not even a state. But we are much more than a regional power. And in this world, everyone is trying to bargain with everyone. There is not a clear consensus on values and on desirable outcomes. It is a fragmented and transactional world. Certainly, this description is oversimplified, but it is clear that the plurality of different actors increases the entropy of the system. And it has an impact on multilateralism, which is weakened due to the lack of global consensus on values and interests. And you can see that at the United Nations where the United Nations Security Council is unable to reach any kind of agreement, and then they go to UNGA [United Nations General Assembly] and then UNGA bypasses the vetoes of the Security Council, and [then] these decisions are rarely implemented because they are not binding. And even the UN Security Council resolutions are [not] implemented. So, in this context, we have to continue fighting for multilateralism because it is the best recipe against power politics. And we, Europeans, have to reflect on how we can revive multilateralism. I hope that during this week, a lot of ideas will come from you, among ourselves, in order to, from your experience from the field, think about it. Now going to concrete things. I am not going to talk about everything because it is impossible. But let me start with the most burning issue, which is, of course, the explosion of violence that we have witnessed since the 7th of October 2023. When I woke up that morning, from the crisis room phoning [me], I had the same feeling that I had in February 2022 when the bombs started falling on Kyiv. I had the feeling that this was a moment that was going to determine the future for decades and we were in an inflexion point in the history. The unfolding tragedy in the Middle East is the outcome of a collective political and moral failure, which the Israeli and the Palestinian people are paying a high price for. And this price will continue to increase if we refuse to see the situation as straightforward. This moral and political failure is due to a real lack of willingness to solve the Israeli-Palestinian problem. Yes, we committed formally on the Two-State solution but without having any credible roadmap to achieve it. And today, the substance of the Israeli-Palestinian problem is not religious nor ethnic, it is a national problem. It is the problem of two people who have the equivalent right to exist on the same land. So, they need to share this land. And please, have a look at the Obama paper, [former President of the United States, Barack] Obama's thoughts on Israel and Gaza. It is very inspiring. Yes, two people on the same land - they have to share it. And the problem is that today, we do not have any kind of agreement on the terms of the 'sharing'. Or yes, we had [one] - remember, [the] Olso [Agreements] 30 years ago? Yes, we had [one]. But we have not implemented it at all. That is the problem. And in the meantime the violence has increased, the figures are appalling, really - not just in the last terrific attack of Hamas against the Israelis and the answer from Israel. It is not just about it - from 2008 [to] 2023 before the 7th of last month, the number of wounded and casualties, it was really too much. What has happened? Why have the Oslo Agreement not been implemented? Because the forces of denial in both camps have continued growing under the hubris of some and the desperation of others. In Israel, the colonisation of the West Bank has been progressing with impunity and violence against the Palestinians - and this has become even more brutal after the 7th of October. Thirty years ago, there were 270,000 settlers in the West Bank. Now there are 700, 000, almost three [or] four times more. In Palestine, the total lack of perspective and diabolic calculations aiming at favoring extremist forces have led to the marginalisation of moderate forces to the benefit of radical forces [inaudible]. Last year, in the West Bank, there were 154 Palestinians killed and 20 Israelis. This year, to date the number is almost 400, and the barbarism of Hamas' actions against Israeli civilians - which are absolutely unjustifiable and inexcusable - puts us in front of the paradox that, in recent years, we believed that the Israeli-Palestinian problem was to be circumvented even if the situation on the ground was continuing to deteriorate because of the Abraham Accords. This illusion was shared by everyone, not just by us, by the West. It was believed by many that the normalisation, the desirable normalisation of relations between the Arab States and Israel, would bring peace between Palestinians and Israelis. That has not happened. It has not happened. Even someone like Jack Sullivan said, before the 7th of October, that ""the region has never been so calm for decades"". Never been so calm for decades. So, how can we explain such blindness? How can we interpret these contradictions? For me, the crux of the matter is that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is no longer an Israeli-Arab conflict. Now, it is becoming a religious or civilisation fight. I was listening yesterday to President [of Turkey, Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan threatening the West [by] saying ""Look, do you want again the fight between the crescent and the crusaders?"" - le croissant et les croisés. These are strong words, and we have to do everything we can in order to avoid this confrontation. On the Israeli side, extremist forces on the West bank determined to put an end to the Palestinian problem through submission or exile. And in the West Bank, Hamas is not present. On the Palestinian [side], the rise of Islamist extremism who want to destroy Israel and threaten the West, who in their view, we protect Israel - and certainly, we do. But, as [former President of the United States, Barack] Obama said, the way Israel prosecutes the right to defence matters. There is no successful military operation without a political strategy behind. The military strategy of Israel has also to abide to international law, including the law that seeks to avoid, to every extent possible, the death and suffering of civilian populations. Ignoring the human cost could ultimately backfire. I am mentioning Obama, but I can also mention a citation from Condoleezza Rice [former United States Secretary of State], who explained very clearly many years ago, in 2011, that we see always the same scenario. Hamas provokes, Israel responds militarily, and the international community grinds its hands. Condoleezza was saying [this] 12 years ago, this time is not different. I wonder, for how many years all the United States' Secretaries [of State] will have to look for the fine line between Israel's right to self defence, and protect United States' interests with [inaudible] allies and friends. The overreaction of the Israelis, in the end, makes them lose the support of international community, and it comes once and again. 2011, 2023, we are in the same place. Well, what do we have to do? First, I think that we, Europeans, have the moral and political obligation to be involved. Not only by providing aid but by contributing to a durable solution. We have a certain experience in state-building, and our capacity to contribute to a political solution will be a major test for our credibility. Certainly, in the short term, the first priority is to bring peace to violence. And this is not going to be easy because the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza is unprecedented. President [of the United States, Joe] Biden has been asking Israel not to be blinded by rage - and I think this is the message that the best friends of Israel have to send to them: not to be blinded by rage. The right to [self] defense has to be performed in accordance with international law as the European Council has stated. But one thing has to be clear. We will not go back to the situation of the 6th of October 2023. This has to be an opportunity for peace. This is the core issue that we have to address. There is no military solution to the conflict. Without a political strategy no one [can] win a battle against terrorism. You can crush people, but everywhere we have to look for political solutions. Even if Hamas is uprooted in Gaza, this will not solve the problem of Gaza, not let alone the West Bank problem. So, overreactions are always understandable, but never effective and the words of Condoleezza Rice resound to me as if they had been said this morning. They were twelve years ago. I think that we have three responsibilities. We must continue sticking to a firm but balanced position, and to avoid importing in Europe this conflict at all costs. Only in France, since the 7th of October, there have been 1,000 antisemitic acts. This has to be fought. Antisemitic or antimuslim sentiments are totally unacceptable. And I want to thank you here, in person, [for] the work of our teams on the ground, for their remarkable contribution for me to be fully informed about how the daily conflict is going on. The second [element] is the humanitarian solution. Call it a ""truce"", a ""window"", whatever. But we need that violence to recede and that international humanitarian law be respected. From this perspective, I think that a humanitarian pause counterbalanced by access to hostages by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), as a first step to their release is an initiative on which we should work. A massive increase in humanitarian support, the evacuation of third country nationals from Gaza, a proportionate Israeli response - all of that is necessary, as necessary it is to keep channels of communication [open] with Israel, with the Palestinian Authority, with Qatar, with Egypt, with Saudi Arabia, and of course the United States and the United Nations. But the important thing is to think about a comprehensive and definitive settlement which is clearly out of reach today. Today it is out of reach, but on the modalities of a political process involving Israel, the Palestinian Authority, the Arab States, the European Union, Turkey and the United States and Norway, who has been playing an essential role in the past. If we do not succeed, this is the last chance of the Two-State solution. If we do not succeed, we will be definitely in a spiral of violence and mutual hate for generations. So, let's engage on that as much as we can. It will be the most important geopolitical challenge for us. But not the only one. Don't forget about Ukraine. More than ever, Ukraine is in [a] struggle to fight against the Russian aggression. If Ukraine loses, we lose. We need to keep our unanimity and our unity in supporting Ukraine. We are the first provider of support to Ukraine. We are, more than the United States, you know the figures. The prospect of membership, the development of a substantial economic and financial assistance programme, [our] military aid through the European Peace Facility and bilateral channels, the provision of security guarantees are essential components of our work. This must [help the] Ukrainian military offensive, which is facing hurdles, to contain the Russian invasion and to recover its territory. You know, the Russian losses are very important, but Russia can re-power. It is ready to sacrifice even more men and equipment without any concern about the human cost of that. Before Putin, Stalin believed that quantity is itself a source of quality, as [if] human life had no meaning and no value. What is unbearable for the Ukrainians in terms of human costs is maybe bearable for the Russians in the short term. So, the only solution is to continue engaging supporting Ukraine and remaining united on that. Because our core values are at stake. Beyond Ukraine, we should not miss the challenge of enlargement. Ukraine has become [as] a new candidate and it is pushing the queue of the former candidates who were waiting for years. And the whole queue will move. And I think that we have to recover the time that we have lost in an endless process of membership. Both wars are different, completely different, in their causes and consequences. But let's be frank: the crisis in the Middle East is already having a lasting impact on our policy in Ukraine. During my recent visit to Washington, for the Summit, together with the two Presidents, [the President of the European] Commission [Ursula von der Leyen] and the [President of the European] Council [Charles Michel], I had the opportunity to express my concern directly to President Biden, and my colleague Blinken, that our international support for Ukraine may erode in the light of what is being seen as the practice of double standards. This is an acute problem that all of you have to contribute to fight. All our delegations have a huge responsibility to build a counter narrative adapted to our local interlocutors. A large number of countries in the Global South see in Ukraine not a global issue, but a regional problem, which affects Europe and the United States - the Western world. It is a West problem. Solve it, and quickly. Because we cannot bear the consequences of this war. And they will take advantage of the crisis in the Middle East to underscore what they see as a contradiction in our positioning or even a contradiction among Europeans, as expressed during the last United Nations [General Assembly] resolution vote. I think that we have to reaffirm our support to the United Nations and to the Secretary-General [António Guterres], who is making huge efforts on all fronts. You, as Ambassadors, have an important role in order to accommodate your language to different contexts, talking as much about resilience or sanctions, as about containment, building and reconciliation. This is part of your skills, and this is part of what I am expecting of you. But never make the mistake of framing global issues in terms of the West against the rest. We have to reject this mental frame. It will be devastating [for] our perception in Asia, in Latin America and in Africa. We are not the outpost of the Western world. We are the keepers of global and shared values based on the United Nations Charter. And this is the Alpha and Omega of my message. We are the keepers of global and shared values based on the United Nations Charter. Everywhere, every time. This is our message. It is not the West against the rest. It is the values of the United Nations Charter as the best ground of multilateralism. Please convey this message loudly. Knowing that every country in the South has its own circumstances and values and they consider that they have no reason to place the Ukrainian challenge above their own priorities, which are related to climate change, digital transition, indebtedness. And they want a better representation within multilateral institutions. Yes, this is an expression of the multilateral world I was talking [about] at the beginning. And we have to take care of that and understand this mental framework. It is not the West against the rest. We are the supporters of the values of the United Nations Charter as the basis for multilateralism to save peace in the world. Then, apart [from] Russia, there is also China, how not? China is the big elephant in the room. I was in China last month and we will hold the next EU-China Summit in one month, approximately. I went to China and I conveyed five key messages, which seem to me [to be] what should guide our policy towards China - our frame policy determinate by the European Union Council: First, we do not have any desire to block China's rise or to engage in a strategic competition with it. And we do not have any difficulty in clarifying our position on Taiwan to Beijing. We will continue developing multifaceted ties with Taiwan, we do not imply recognition of Taiwan's sovereignty. Second, remain firm on the idea of systemic rivalry with China. They do not like it, I understand but I have explained to my Chinese interlocutors that certainly, in some things we are rivals because we defend different socio-political systems. The rest of the world is looking at us, trying to choose between one and the other. China aims to roll back our universalist view of rights, taking the countries of the South, which sometimes are closer to Beijing than to us, as witnesses. We have to accept this rivalry and confrontation with China. But being rivals does not mean that we are enemies. We are just presenting different geopolitical systems. So, this will go into other arenas, this will go also to the digital technology and artificial intelligence that will frame the way that society works. Do not try to escape. Yes, there is a rivalry, an intrinsic rivalry because we have different socio-political systems. We are not enemies, we [have] nothing against the rights of China, it has a role to play in the world, we need China. But the third point is that we need to make China understand that it will be difficult for China to maintain its access to the European market at a time when European companies are finding it increasingly difficult to work in China. We have a gigantic trade deficit [between Europe and China], 400 billion [dollars] a year and [is still] growing very quickly, 60% growth in the last two years. This is not due to a simple difference in competitiveness, [which] is China's argument. This abyssal deficit is largely attributable due to the very high level of public subsidies granted to Chinese companies, as well as to the ever-increasing barriers to entry into the Chinese market. The problem is becoming more acute as China's exports leads affecting our main industrial sectors in which we have had, traditionally, an advantage, [such as the] automotive and chemical industries. If China continues to deny the reality and consequences of this imbalance, it runs the risk of seeing a rising demand in Europe for more protection. We are not protectionist, but maybe we have to protect ourselves. If China does not open, maybe we will have to close. This is something that has to be discussed, which makes me go to the fourth point: de-risking. The de-risking [strategy] is not designed to get out of China, but simply to do what China is already doing: to diversify its sources of supply and, therefore, diversify risk. I told them at Beida University that we are just following the advice of President [of China] Xi [Jinping] when he said: ""China needs to build a domestic supply system that is independently controllable, secure and reliable so that self-circulation can be accomplished at critical moments without having strong dependencies on others."" Ok, this is de-risking with Chinese characteristics. And we have our own de-risking, which in the end is more or less the same thing. Common sense. But common sense doesn't need to be with a belligerent accent or of ideological dimension. It is just a matter of organising better our interactions with this very important partner. I think that the Chinese authorities should be much more worried by the fact that the European foreign investment in China is decreasing. The ones who are there stay, but there are no newcomers. The newcomers have new opportunities in the vibrant Southeast Asia economies. So, China should be much more worried [about] that than [about] our de-risking. I want to stress the fact that economic security is an important part of our foreign policy, but it has not to be presented as an anti-China plot. On the contrary, we need China, we have to increase the level of cooperation with China: its systemic weight is so great that there is no chance of solving any of the world challenges without a strong engagement from China. China is burning more coal than the rest of the world together. So how can you pretend to solve the climate change issue without strong engagement from China? It is important to continue cooperating and to continue putting clearly what we expect from China. I, personally, told the Chinese friends: ""I expect you to do more in Ukraine."" We do not expect China to take our position but, yes, to engage more with Ukrainians, particularly on humanitarian aid and to convince Russia to get out from Ukraine. Well, I should talk about Armenia-Azerbaijan, Libya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Yemen, Iran, JCPoA, Myanmar, Afghanistan, Serbia-Kosovo, do not worry, I will not. First, because it is impossible and second because I want to put my attention on two transversal issues which are very important, I think. One, security. Remember I am the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. And we need to strengthen our security policy. It has to be understood in the broader sense. Not just military. Economic security is becoming an increasingly central part of our foreign and security policy. It does not mean that we want to close, on the contrary, we want to develop more investments and trade links all around the world. The Global Gateway is there for that. We have to abandon the old-style extractivism. ""Where is the lithium?"" People in Latin America look at us as the ones who come once again looking for minerals. No, it is not a matter of ""where are your minerals?"" It is ""how can we build, with you, partnerships in order to use the natural resources, so that you add value, and you benefit from our demand"". We have to have look at the Inflation Reduction Act's consequences. It is not a minor thing. We have to continue working for [on] the Enlargement, which is maybe our most important foreign policy. In the meantime, the European Political Community has to be developed. On security, I am very happy to say that the Stategic Compass is going step by step, advancing. We held the first military exercise among European Union armies, out of the NATO framework, in Spain, the other day. Almost 3 000 soldiers from nine European Union countries. This is the Rapid Deployment Capacity [in] the making, and it will happen. It will be the greatest contribution of this [mandate]: to make the security policy high on the agenda. A word on Sahel. Sooner or later, we will suffer from the consequences of what happens there. More military juntas mean more insecurity, more instability, more migratory flows towards Europe. Our strategic patience has not led to results. In Niger, our lack of unity among Europeans has weakened the answer of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). We have failed to support 'African solutions for African problems' - one of these mantras that we repeat - like the 'Two-States solution' that, in practical terms, does not follow. All in all, we are making progress in the field of security and defence, but much more has to be done. We need more financial [means] and we need more coordination among our armies. The second transversal thing is the relationship with the Global South. Global South - I do not like the word, this is a complex set of people, very heterogenous with different positions. But this is a concept that has been [brought] to the public debate. And now, today, is being used by them, so we cannot avoid the fact that they call it and feel it as being something that exists as an answer to the West that dominated the world for the last 500 years. We understand now that it is over, intellectually. I think that we have not taken yet the consequences and the practical conclusions of this new reality. Yes, the majority of the countries have condemned the Russian aggression against Ukraine. But they have been doing lip service. Our sanctions have not been followed by many. And the current Israel-Palestinian conflict will increase the accusations of double standards. There are two things that have to be taken into account when we talk about resentment against the West. One is the pandemic, and the other is climate change. Have a look at the graph of the number of vaccinations across the time since the pandemic started. You will see that in October 2021, two years ago, we - the high-income countries - we had 1.4 doses per head. If you were an inhabitant of a low-income country, you had 30 times less, 0.04. Yes, we had been the greatest provider of vaccines. Yes, we had been the greatest exporter of vaccines. But the reality is that when we had 1.4 doses per head, they had 30 times less. And this was a matter of life or death. And they had that very much present. They were lagging behind us. The second thing is climate change. If you talk about climate change, keep in mind that we are responsible for almost 25% of the cumulated global CO2 emissions, almost one quarter. Africa, where there are three times more people than here, is responsible for 3%. And South America is responsible for 3%. So, it is understandable that they tell us: ""Yes, there is a problem. Certainly, there is a problem, but who created the problem? Certainly not us. You created it. So, it is clear that you have to be ready to facilitate more support for the green transition."" But keep in mind the socioeconomic situation of the people around the world. There are 600 million people in Africa that have never seen an electric [light] bulb. So, do not tell them that they have to be green and digital because they will say: ""What are you talking about? I have never seen a computer screen; I have never seen a light bulb. Green and digital? What does it mean? I want to eat."" Their priorities are different. We think on a 20-years horizon, they think on a 20-days horizon. This has to be very much present in our approach because, yes, they have to contribute to the fight against climate change, but there is a shared endeavour that comes from different responsibilities. And we, Europeans, have done our part. When we promised €100 000 million to support the climate transition, we have done our part. Sell it, explain it, because it seems that we have not done [much]. More has to be done, but do not forget what we have already done in order to help the [Global] South on [with] their green transition. Our partnership with South Africa marks a good way. [The] African Union, being a member of the G20, marks the way. There have to be more engagements with international structures, financial institutions. We have to let them room, because when we created this world order, many of them did not exist, they were colonies. Others had such a small economic influence that they did not count. Now, they count. They are independent countries, and they want to have their capacity to participate in the building not of the order that was built 70 years ago, but the order that will come out of the challenges we are facing. So, support Ukraine actively against Russia's disinformation. We have to keep an eye on our societies not to get tired of supporting Ukraine, fighting against the tiredness, showing that our policy in the Middle East is first and foremost a principle policy, rooted in international law. Never forget to mention that when you talk about the right of the Israelis' right to defend [themselves], which certainly [they] have, and have to use it. And make everything you can in order to strengthen our links with the Global South. In 25 years from now, One out of four people in the world - 25% of the people in the world - will be living in Africa. There is a youth bomb, and we know it. The youth in Africa, young people in Africa do not want to be a problem, they want to have their opportunities. But can you imagine? One out of four human beings will be in Africa. Four of the six most growing countries in the world are Africans. Africa is not just a land of misery and migration. It is not just a land of wars. Yes, there are a lot, but it is also a land of opportunities and where humankind will be growing. We have to be more active in Africa. We want to say that we are partners of choice. Have we succeeded in that? I think that not enough. If we want to be the partner of choice of Africa, we have to do more, we have to do more on all fronts. I [gave] you a lot of duties to do, I count on you. It is a critical moment, work hard. Thank you.  ",0.0,0.0

Despite decades of international agreements and countless high-level summits, success in forestalling this existential crisis has remained elusive, says Dr. Rabitz.In his new monograph, the KTU researcher delves into the intersection of cutting-edge technological solutions and the global environmental crisis. The author explores how international institutions respond (or fail to respond) to high-impact technologies that have been the subject of extensive debate and controversy.""Some of the proposed solutions are more intrusive than others: they might offer a boon for environmental sustainability but they might also create considerable problems for the global environment and human societies. Such Transformative Novel Technologies remain unrealized: whether they will eventually deliver on their promise, and whether their associated perils can be avoided or at least minimized, depends to a large degree on the availability of adequate governance mechanisms,"" explains Dr. Rabitz.Biotechnology to fight biodiversity lossFor example, one of the chapters in the monograph focuses on the broader field of biotechnology, and the potential role of novel biotechnologies in nature conservation. The ongoing biodiversity loss, provoked by invasive alien species (non-native organisms, disrupting the ecosystems into which they have been introduced due to human activities) is one of the characteristics of the current planetary crisis. The world's leading scientific and policy organizations have been grappling with the urgent need to address this issue.""The UN acknowledges that target 15.8 of the Sustainable Development Goals, aiming to prevent and significantly reduce the impact of biological invasions on land- and water ecosystems by 2020, has so far not been reached,"" says Dr. Rabitz.He goes on to explain that scientists are currently exploring a variety of biotechnological countermeasures, including so-called gene drive systems that might effectively counteract invasive alien species through rapid and ecosystem-wide genetic engineering.However, the use of these technologies introduces unprecedented risks and challenges that demand careful consideration andinternational collaboration. Gene drive systems, in particular, have become the subject of intense political scrutiny on the global stage, engaging institutions such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the World Health Organization.The problem with novel technologies is their unprecedented natureDr. Rabitz believes that transformative novel technologies, such as those currently under consideration for combatingclimate changethrough large-scale manipulation of planetary reflectivity, require adequate governance solutions to reap their potential benefits or to reduce their potential harm. Yet, these solutions are unreachable so far.""What I show in my book is that effective international responses are few and far between, while there is a broad range of international institutions that could, in principle, provide governance solutions for the challenges and opportunities which those technologies pose, in practice, they often fail to do so,"" says Dr. Rabitz.He presumes that there are different reasons why this might be the case, one of them being the unusual and partially unprecedented nature of those technologies, which leads to a significant governance gap at the international level. According to him, this is not just the case in the environmental domain. Artificial Intelligence is another example, where the absence of international regulatory activity stands in stark contrast to the political, economic and social stakes.""We might well disagree on what precisely should be done with these and other types of transformative novel technologies—for instance, whether to restrict them, to ban them or to facilitate their responsible development and use. But in one way or another, the absence of appropriate international solutions for a wide range of momentous, contemporary technological developments is bound to create problems sooner or later,"" says Dr. Rabitz.",0.0,0.0

The OECD report comes ahead of the UN's COP28 climate negotiations later this month in Dubai, where finance will be a major sticking point. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is tasked with monitoring official figures on the pledge to help developing countries fund their energy transitions and resilience in the face of accelerating climate impacts. In 2009, richer countries promised to reach $100 billion annually in funding for these priorities by 2020. Failure to meet the target on time has damaged trust in international climate negotiations. In the most up to date figures, the OECD said richer countries reached $89.6 billion in total funding for 2021. ""Based on preliminary and as yet unverified data, the goal looks likely to have already been met as of 2022,"" said OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann in the foreword to the latest report. But he added experts estimate that developing countries will need to spend about a trillion dollars a year by 2025 for climate investments, rising to roughly $2.4 trillion each year between 2026 and 2030. ""Although public finance can only contribute a share of these extensive needs,"" Cormann said, international donors would be crucial in helping to boost overall funding. He said that currently finance from rich countries was not effective enough in attracting additional private sector investments and funding. Finance focused on adaptation that countries must embark on to prepare themselves for an array of increasing climate impacts was also lagging, he said. Adaptation measures can include building coastal defences, or helping farmers become more resilient to increasingly ferocious floods, droughts and other climate extremes. Many developing economies least to blame for the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming are among the most exposed to the costly and destructive effects of worsening weather extremes and rising seas. World leaders meeting at the climate talks in the United Arab Emirates will face a tough reckoning over financial solidarity between rich polluters and vulnerable nations, as a failure to cut planet-heating emissions threatens the Paris Agreement's global warming limits. Adaptation is a key priority for developing countries and wealthy governments have promised to double adaptation finance by 2025, to $40 billion a year. But as the world warms, climate change impacts increase and so too do the costs of preparing for them. Earlier this month, a report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) projected that overall annual funding that developing countries need to adapt to climate impacts this decade had increased to as much as $387 billion. At the time, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned action was ""stalling"" even as the need to protect people increases.",-1.0,0.0

To meet climate goals, countries will have to get far more ambitious and quickly. Here's what to look for at COP28.   The world's premier  climate change  conference next month will be hosted by a country among those arguably with the most to lose from more ambitious climate action.   The global community is required to take ambitious actions to respond to climate change but host the United Arab Emirates might be one of those most challenged by the need to broker a faster shift away from high-emission fuels.   When COP28 - the United Nations Climate Change Conference - convenes in Dubai on 30 November, the crucial question will be how to balance the speed of energy transition and economic transformation against the needs of sustainable development and alternative energy sources.   After five years, the conference is returning to Asia, hosted by a country that is the eighth-largest global oil producer and is among the highest per capita emitters in the world.   But while the United Arab Emirates is happy to host COP28, it's too soon to say whether such a rich country would be willing to reduce its absolute dependence on oil resources.   It's also yet to be seen whether the  UAE  is willing to bring down its emissions in pursuit of a global goal, especially when many aspects of the Paris Agreement - a landmark climate treaty struck at COP in 2015 - are yet to become fully functional.   Although the UAE is a rich nation, it is connected to developing economies by climate change. It is a part of the Global South and a member of the G77 and China group.   The host nation's political and ideological leanings on climate change align with countries that see climate change as a global challenge resulting from cumulative emissions, and also as one that affects their economic resources and infrastructure hugely and harshly.   For such countries, addressing climate change means bearing a massive cost to their economies, sacrificing their development to support a clean energy transition.   Just energy transition is not the only issue that will cause agitation at COP28.   The UAE, as holder of the COP presidency, will have to deal with four other major tasks: getting agreements on the Global Stocktake of climate action; building consensus on Global Goal on Adaptation; setting up the Loss and Damage Fund; and advancing climate finance commitments beyond 2025.   Discussions on finance will likely move slowly. The New Collective Qualified Goal of finance under the Paris Agreement is set to be finalised in 2024 and implemented in 2025, and there are still issues over raising money from multilateral development banks and the private sector.   However, the host country will have to ensure that the talks go beyond just reaffirming the existing USD 100 billion pledge.   An estimated USD 4 trillion a year needs to be mobilised by 2030 to support the clean energy transition.   Achieving the net zero goal by mid-century requires much more than that. The UAE will need to work with governments, as well as multilateral development banks and financial institutions, to enhance the scope and scale of climate finance.   The Global Stocktake and the Loss and Damage Fund, both of which have big implications for developing economies, will test the ability of the presidency to remain neutral while adhering to the principles of the Paris Agreement.   UAE recently attended the G20 summit in  Delhi  as an invitee and climate change and energy transition were discussed at length.   The G20 does not set the terms of negotiations for climate conferences, but it is hard to imagine that the COP28 host countries and other major players in climate are not influenced by it, given the grouping's global power.   The G20 has recognised and supported the global emission reduction target reductions, as suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and called for a 43 per cent reduction in emissions from 2019 levels by 2030.   It has also endorsed a global peaking of emissions by 2025 and backed the demand for scaled up finance - USD 5.9 trillion a year to meet the global net zero goal.   The G20 has underscored the necessity of developed economies meeting their commitments on climate finance at previous COPs, exhorting them to scale up contributions from billions to the promised trillions.   The first synthesis report of the technical dialogue on the Global Stocktake of climate actions was released in September 2023 by the  UN Framework Convention on Climate Change  secretariat.   The report says the pace of global emissions does not meet desired global mitigation pathways laid out in the Paris Agreement to achieve the temperature goal of 2 degrees Celsius below the pre-industrial level.   To stay below that maximum temperature, every country needs to do a lot more and effectively transform all sectors of the world economy.   But the Global Stocktake dialogue report is silent on what might be done to bridge the widening gap between the existing efforts of countries and the options that can be adopted in time for the next cycle of Nationally Determined Contributions in 2025.   The fractured debate over future action and on the formulations that emerged from the G20's Delhi Declaration mean the presidency might find it difficult to seek more concessions on the fossil fuel phaseout beyond those agreed in Glasgow in 2021.   In Glasgow, parties agreed to phase down unabated coal-based energy but left other  fossil fuels  like oil and natural gas untouched beyond subsidy reduction targets. In 2022, the G20 adopted the same language.   There are no meaningful signs that developed economies have tweaked or peaked their emissions substantially since Glasgow. The strains on the global energy system and costs imposed by the Russia-Ukraine war make it doubly difficult to negotiate an immediate scaling down of conventional fuels. A reduction on conventional fuels would be difficult to achieve unless renewable energy is rapidly and significantly scaled up globally.   Both the Clean Energy Ministerial of major economies and the G20 have recently raised the possibility of setting new global targets. Options raised include tripling global renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030.   There is an expectation within the oil industry that the UAE might seek support for carbon capture storage technologies as a way of balancing its emissions from oil production and use it as a condition for agreeing to such targets.   India has been generally suspicious of carbon capture and storage technology because of its cost and doubts over technical feasibility.   Technological progress has been slow and is yet to make any dent on the energy system.   However, promising initiatives on clean technologies have emerged, including the Green Hydrogen Innovation Centre under the purview of the International Solar Alliance. A Global Biofuel Alliance has also been launched by the G20.   If recognised at COP28, these initiatives might boost international efforts to produce, trade and use low or zero-emission fuels. But all of these are likely to make an impact only in the medium or long term.   With the Global Stocktake sending a message that the world is not on track to meet the climate change challenge, the UAE as host of COP28 will have its task cut out.   It will need to assure the world that even as an oil producer it is willing to put its weight behind the technologies and policy choices key to achieving emission cuts and use its prestige as host to achieve consensus on increased climate finance for developing economies.

The increasing floods, tropical storms, atmospheric rivers, hurricanes and the temperature of the oceans in Miami should already have put you on high alert. Earth is warming at an alarming rate, and what we need now is to mobilize action and funding for climate solutions that can help prevent a global climate crisis. There is a crisis in funding for communities and climate. The research is clear: Host countries, companies, organizations and individuals that are leading on climate are stepping up their decarbonization efforts as well as mitigating carbon emissions in a variety of forms, with much of their effort coming through the purchase of carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market. The problem I see is that there's currently a small cohort of individuals and academic pundits in the climate space who are deciding what’s appropriate climate action and what’s not. This has caused massive uncertainty in the market and is holding back investment and climate action at a time when we need it most. I argue that these efforts to define the “chosen” path to climate success are killing ambition, not raising it. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has said it in many different ways: We need everything, and we need it now. This means that as business leaders and individuals, we must both reduce our emissions wherever possible and also draw emissions from the atmosphere. We may need to be better at how we measure success, but I’ll get to that. Reducing emissions of your NPO or your personal life takes a lot of forms: Reduce reliance on fossil fuels in whatever ways we can. Reduce road trips and flights, and take rail or public transport if possible. Reduce our reliance on plastics, and recycle and reuse where we can. Cut back on food waste. Switch to renewable energy. We also need to reduce illegal logging and deforestation, since a cut tree will eventually result in emissions. We need to provide electricity to off-grid communities to prevent emissions from alternative fuels such as kerosene. We must reduce methane emissions right now, as capturing or destroying this giga-pollutant is one of the fastest ways we have to make an immediate impact on global warming. Methane is 80 times worse for the environment in a 20-year time frame than CO2. Methane activities include reducing methane emissions from livestock and human sanitation or creating proper landfills to take the place of roadside dumps so that methane emissions can be measured, captured and used to create electricity or flared into a less offensive gas. We need to reduce emissions from old refrigerants or fire-fighting gases. Not all of these will apply to your NPO, but you can still be a steward for climate action by calling upon others who are contributing to these irresponsible emissions. We also need to remove CO2 already in the atmosphere. This means investments to plant new forests or replace ones that have been destroyed, or to support the development of new technologies for the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. I believe that a carbon market solution can accomplish all these things, and by investing in it, your NPO can make a tangible impact. The methodology, supply, interest, funding and demand are all in place and efficient. Still, nothing is moving because many academics and carbon experts have taken the view that these third-party verified and validated emission reductions must be overestimated. Unfortunately, carbon accounting has not—and, in my opinion, cannot—ever be an exact science. There is no doubt that not everyone agrees on the best way to count emission reductions. Some methods endorsed by critics are misguided or based on faulty research or conclusions, and most can easily be rebutted by the project if given equal exposure. Yes, I recognize that some methods put forth by the carbon market need newer science. However, it is important to note that the ability to measure and count emissions has improved over time as new science and methodologies become available. In fact, two initiatives I'm familiar with—the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (for which I serve as a board member) and the Voluntary Carbon Market Integrity Initiative—are now providing end-to-end accountability and oversight on emission reduction accounting, quality, integrity and the application of emission reductions to corporate goals. In addition, carbon crediting programs or carbon standards are enlisting help from experts to further review their (already) peer-reviewed and approved methodologies to see where immediate improvements can be made. My perspective is that carbon crediting standards must improve their methodologies, science must help guide better measurement of reductions and we must move quickly to adopt improvements at the project level. I think critics of the carbon market hope that by calling out problems with project accounting for specific projects, the world will walk away from a market-based solution to climate. What they fail to realize is that without this source of financing, solving the crisis with government or philanthropy alone will be impossible. It is only with a functioning market that we can raise ambition from the private sector. The knowledge that funding can be delivered effectively, efficiently and at scale to mitigate the worst effects of climate change should unlock a torrent of ambition. We should also take pride in what is being accomplished with a viable market: Millions of hectares of forest have been protected from deforestation and degradation, millions of dollars have landed in marginalized communities for adaptation and resilience, thousands of jobs have been created, hundreds of roadside dumps have been closed and countless people are now gathering less fuel for cooking. These are just a few of the examples of the impact a healthy voluntary carbon market can have that I’ve seen firsthand. So please don’t kill ambition—let’s raise it!

Called regenerative landscape design (RLD), the approach was recently developed by a multi-institution collaboration led by Penn State researchers to enhance sustainability and better address complex and interconnected environmental and social challenges, such as climate change, biodiversity loss and social inequality.Erica Smithwick, a distinguished professor of geography in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, is the lead author of the paper, which was published in the journalEcology and Society.""The socio-environmental challenges that we face today are intricately intertwined,"" Smithwick said. ""However, the existing frameworks that strive to bring about change in areas such as resilience,landscape ecology, architecture, agriculture and geography are often compartmentalized and disciplinary. They often fall short of adequately addressing the social and scientific intricacies. Regenerative landscapedesignintegrates a cross section of knowledge systems that guides solutions to resilient and stabilized answers that truly benefit people.""Smithwick said the three elements of RLD—regenerative systems, landscape approaches and collaborative design—have been individually explored in multiple disciplines, but this is the first time they were analyzed collectively. The research team's effort resulted in the development of RLD, a framework to guide intentional collaboration aimed at improving both the environment and society and to address the shortfalls of siloed approaches, according to Smithwick.The intention, Smithwick said, is that researchers can apply RLD to complex, interconnected environmental andsocial challengesto develop solutions that are inclusive, comprehensive and scalable.In a regenerative system, the changes that are made result in more giving than taking and a net positive toward a desirable outcome—it is a step beyond sustainability.Landscape approaches allow for managing social-ecological systems because landscapes are large enough to capture the relationships between people and the environment, but small enough to be manageable. Landscapes also display social patterns and connect different disciplines.Lastly, the focus on design—specifically co-design—emphasizes cooperation and facilitated teamwork. Landscapes are made up of various parts that work together, and they can be fashioned in a way that improves the environment.Co-author Lisa Iulo, associate professor of architecture and director of the Hamer Center for Community Design, said RLD allows people to create positive environmental and societal change together.""Regenerative landscape design works with affected communities to address complex and interconnected challenges,"" Iulo said. ""RLD defines a process for people to design collaboratively. It brings together multiple disciplines with community experts to ensure research questions are grounded in the reality of place, establishing local and globally applicable solutions for regenerative built environments. RLD is inclusive and enlightening, recognizing people as an integral part of the landscape.""Leland Glenna, a professor of rural sociology and science, technology and society in the College of Agricultural Sciences, is also a co-author on the paper. He said the deficit model, which suggests the public is disconnected from such work because they do not understand or know enough to support the science, is a top-down approach that can fall short when developing solutions.""Social and biophysical scientists are increasingly recognizing that the deficit model fails to capture why lay audiences might fail to understand or even resist efforts to promote societal change that would promote regenerative ecological outcomes,"" Glenna said. ""Regenerative landscape design operates on the premise that two-way communication is needed between experts and stakeholders to fully understand the social, ethical and biophysical dimensions of problems and to develop comprehensive strategies for solving problems.""In addition to changes toresearch methods, the structure that supports the research enterprise needs to evolve, according to Smithwick, who is also the associate director of the Institute of Energy and the Environment.""The mechanisms that are currently in place to review, fund and implement research are limited in how they can acknowledge or support co-design approaches such as RLD,"" she said. ""The system must be able to recognize that there are alternative ways of knowing, including Indigenous worldviews and alternative solutions outcomes.""In the paper, the team provided examples of how regenerative landscape design could be applied in practice around the world. In the Chesapeake Bay area, the framework could be used to restore oyster reefs and other coastal habitats. In the example, intertwined issues such as extreme weather and flooding, regional economic needs, cultural and historical values and water quality are addressed collectively.The research team explained how RLD could provide opportunities for collaborative design of optimal land-use plans that restore and enhance water quality while adding value to communities through flood protection. They also shared how participatory research with landowners could help identify the social, environmental and economic goals of potential restoration activities.In Kenya, the researchers said, RLD could be used to create more sustainable agropastoral landscapes, which is land that accommodates both growing crops and raising livestock. In this example, the research team described systems that not only withstand future challenges like locust plagues orclimate change, but also actively work towards a better state by addressing past land-use mistakes and considering both social andenvironmental factors.""Regenerativelandscapedesign is a new frontier in systems science, one that is rooted in collaboration, ethics and a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of social and natural systems,"" Smithwick said. ""It is a call to action for us to work together to create landscapes that are more resilient, equitable and sustainable.""",1.0,1.0

This causes brighter, whiter clouds to form. These low marine clouds reflect sunlight away from the ocean's surface, protecting the marine life below from the worst of climate change.Australia'sReef Restoration and Adaptation Program—a collaboration between several universities, CSIRO and the Australian Institute of Marine Science—is exploring whether cloud brightening couldreduce coral bleaching. As an oceanographer and engineer I lead the program's research intocooling and shadingtechniques.We started exploring cloud brightening after the mass bleaching event in 2016. First, we needed to develop and test the underlying technologies in the lab. Then we began pilot testing in the central Great Barrier Reef near Townsville during January 2020. After several iterations we have now moved beyond ""proof of concept"" to investigating the response of the clouds themselves.The Cloud Brightening Field Trip of 2021. Credit: Southern Cross UniversityA bright ideaBritish cloud physicist John Latham originally proposed cloud brightening in 1990 as a way tocontrol global warmingby altering Earth's energy balance. He calculated that brightening clouds across the most susceptible regions of the world's oceans could counteract theglobal warmingcaused by a doubling of preindustrial atmospheric carbon dioxide. That's a level likely to be reached by the year 2060.Recently, scientists have begun to consider regional rather than global application of cloud brightening. Could brightening clouds directly over the Great Barrier Reef for a few monthsreduce coral bleachingduring a marine heat wave?Modeling studies are encouraging and suggest it coulddelay the expected decline in coral cover. This could buy valuable time for the reef while the world transitions away from fossil fuels.Lowering the heat stress on the ecosystem would produceother benefitswhen combined with other reef interventions—such as improved control of invasive crown of thorns starfish and planting of corals with increased heat tolerance.But these studies also show there's a limit to what can be achieved. Long-term benefits are only possible if the cloud brightening activity occurs alongside aggressive emissions reductions.Cloud brightening does haverisks as well as benefits, but the prospect of intermittent regional use is very different to large-scale ""solar geo-engineering"" proposals for shading and cooling the whole planet.We expect the regional effect will be short-lived and reversible, which is reassuring. The technology must be operated continuously to modify clouds and could be stopped at any time. The sea salt particles sprayed in the process typically only persist in the atmosphere forone to several days.How do you brighten a cloud?A warm cloud (as opposed to an ice cloud) is a collection of small water droplets floating in the air.A cloud of many small droplets is brighter than one with fewer large droplets—even if both clouds contain the same amount of water overall.Every droplet begins with the condensation of water vapor around a nucleus, which can be almost any kind of tiny particle suspended in air.Typically, in the lower atmosphere over land there are thousands to tens of thousands of these tiny particles suspended in every cubic centimeter of air. We call these airborne particles ""aerosols.""Aerosols may be naturalsuch as dust, sea salt, pollen, ash and sulfates. Or they may come from human activity such as burningfossil fuelsor vegetation, manufacturing, vehicle exhaust and aerosol spray cans.In very clean maritime air, the aerosols available to form clouds are mainlysulfates and sea salt crystals. And they are few and far between, only afew hundred per cubic centimeter.When a cloud forms under these conditions, water vapor is forced to condense around fewer nuclei, creatinglarger droplets and fewer of them. Large droplets reflect less light for the same volume of cloud water.To brighten such clouds, we can spray large quantities of microscopic seawater droplets into the air. This process of atomizing seawater mimics the generation of sea salt aerosols by wind and waves in the ocean. If these are incorporated into a cloud and create extra droplets, the cloud will be brightened.Sea salt also provides additional shade bydirect scattering of light.Testing the theoryAlthough scientists have researched cloud brightening for more than 30 years, no one had ever directly tested the theory. In Australia, we have now developed technology to a point where we are starting to measure the response of the clouds.We are beginning such tests with the support and permission of Traditional Owners, who have sustainably managed their Sea Country for tens of thousands of years.Our research program involves more than 15research institutionsand has multiple levels ofgovernanceand oversight.Not so far-fetchedMost people probably don't realize we are already inadvertently brightening the clouds. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates humanity's unintentional release of aerosolsoffsets around 30%of the warming effect due to greenhouse gases.Sulfates in ship exhaust are such a potent source of aerosols for droplet formation, the passage of ships leaves cloud trails calledship tracks.When the International Maritime Organization introduced new rules limiting the sulfur content of marine fuels, the number and extent of ship tracksdrastically reduced, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Arecent studyeven suggests the devastating heat wave that swept the Northern Hemisphere earlier this year was worsened by the absence of ship tracks.The world-first research we are conducting in Australia aims to determine if we could harness the clouds in an effective, environmentally responsible and socially acceptable manner for the future conservation of one of our most precious ecosystems.",1.0,0.0

Humans are driving climate change. And that means we humans can change our trajectory. While governments and businesses have a key role to play in reducing planet-heating emissions, individual actions matter, too. Many solutions can feel overwhelming, or far beyond what one person can tackle (on top of the everyday challenges of life). Across the NPR Network we've been reporting on individual actions that can make a positive impact and what you need to do to get started. We've gathered a bunch here. Some require a little planning (think major home appliance replacement), while others might mean one less thing on your weekend to do (like skipping raking your leaves this fall). Some are suited for homeowners, others are doable if you're renting, and others still are general guidance for any stage of life. We've broken them down by indoor, outdoor and on-the-go actions to help you find what's right for you at this moment. INDOOR—OUTDOOR—ON THE GO Heat pumps can work for both heatingandcooling.

You can think of a heat pump as an air conditioner that can also work backward. If you've got AC, make sure you're using it right.Engineers saymost air conditioner systems are only designed to keep indoor temperatures about 20 degrees coolerthan outdoors. So the hotter the air, the more effort your unit is putting in to bring the temperature down and the more power it's consuming.Here are five ways to make sure you are getting the most out of your unit. Upgrade your gas furnace to a heat pump.Heat pumps both heatandcool your home, while reducing gas usage in your home and the risk for methane leaks. While they can help you cut down on energy costs, switching to a heat pump is a major investment. Make sure to check and see if there are any local rebates (likethis one for Washington residentsorthese incentives in California) you could be eligible for if you start to budget for one.There are also federal credits of up to $2,000for efficient heat pumps that could help with the investment. Renters might also be able to get credits. Keep your home safe from smoke.As smoke reaches new areas of North America, you may be wondering how to keep your air safe during wildfire season.Parts of the country that have been navigating wildfires for generations have some tips to share. Switch to electric cooking.Not only is gas-powered cooking releasing harmful chemicals into the environment, butit could be contributing to health problemsfor you if you're cooking indoors. Plus, research has shown gas stoves can leak pollutantseven when they're off. If replacing your stove seems out of reach, check to see whether your area might offer assistance to bring down the cost (Sacramento wants all gas appliances out by 2045) orswitch at least part time to an electric hot plate. There aresolutions gas stove makers could take toward reducing the risk — here's how.Plus,all your gas and induction stove questions, answered. Stay cool without an air conditioner.In many parts of the country central air is not common, especially in residential buildings. As climate change causes temperatures in many areas to rise, staying cool has required some creative solutions.Here are six life hacks from India on how to stay comfortable and safe even when temperatures rise. Save money on your utilities.Isn't it great when you can save money while helping the environment? For example, in Los Angeles the Department of Water and Power will help youcover the cost of adding a water-monitoring system to your homeso you can track usage by the hour vs. the bimonthly breakdown you get on your bill. Eat more sustainably.While it does depend on where you are and what's locally available, there are some general guidelines you can follow with the planet in mind when it comes to eating.First, be mindful of your meat.Cows create a lot of methane (a significant driver of global climate change). As WBUR reported: One study found swapping out beef with almost anything else for one meal a day cancut a person's dietary carbon footprint by 48%. Then, address your food waste. Cut down on what you throw away (wilted basil can become pesto; scraps can become compost). And watch out for single-use items like coffee pods thatgenerate greenhouse gases to produce the individual-serving packaging. Looking for more on sustainable eating?WBUR has a whole newsletter about it. Fix what you have instead of replacing it.Shoes, clothes, furniture and even some electronics can be repaired to extend their life and keep waste out of landfills.WUWM has a roundup of businesses that can help in the Milwaukee areaand can serve as inspiration to find resources in your community.

In parts of the country where water usage is a top concern, you can get paid to replace your lawn with native plants or shrubs (like this program in Utah). Ifyou're attached to the look, set your mower blade higher and leave the clippings where they are to help fertilize your grass. If you're in the mood for a change, add an edible garden orplants native to your regionthat will require less care. Some, like clover, help balance the soil and pull nitrogen out of the air.

Leverage your roof.Earlier this summer, the fire that devastated historic Lahaina in western Maui left a red-roofed house relatively unscathed. The owner credited the house's miraculous survival, in part,to the specially designed metal roofadded during a recent renovation. If cutting down cooling costs is a top concern in your area,research suggests painting your roof whitecould be a cost-effective way to reduce summer heat. And depending on your sun exposure, rooftop solar could be a long-term investment to lower energy costs and reduce your home's reliance on nonrenewable energy. Make sure to check local rebates and incentives that could lower the upfront costs.

In late November, the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) will be launched in Dubai. Coming at the end of a year which broke multiple heat records, the event is supposed to set the stage for a major push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and boost climate change adaptation globally. But ahead of the conference, there have already been warnings from climate activists and civil society that unless there is a marked change in the approach to climate policies, COP28 could fail to deliver any meaningful progress. In the Global South, there is persistent worry that wealthy nations and international corporations will push for policies that allow them to continue business as usual, with poorer nations, which are the least responsible for climate change, bearing the brunt of the climate crisis. Such tendencies have already been observed at previous climate events, including most recently at the Africa Climate Summit held in Nairobi in early September. The conference, which gathered thousands of representatives from governments, businesses, international organisations and civil society, was a chance for African peoples to agree on a common position on issues such as loss and damage compensation, climate mitigation and climate finance ahead of COP28. But the final document issued by the summit – the Nairobi Declaration – did not reflect a consensus and the best interest of African nations. This is not surprising, given that lobbyists for Global North countries and corporations were given the space and high-level access to push for false solutions. Meanwhile, many of the delegates – activists and members of civil society calling for clarity and solutions to support our continent ­– faced access difficulties during proceedings and were left feeling sidelined. As a result, instead of pushing for policies that would see the Global North compensate African nations for its historic greenhouse gas emissions, which have catalysed global warming, the summit embraced policies that will further hurt African nations. Its declaration focused heavily on – and legitimised – problematic practices like carbon credits, offsetting, and trading. These are false solutions and they are not what Africa needs. They constitute a neocolonial tactic that allows the Global North to continue to emit greenhouse gases whilе retaining control over African land and people and taking the credit for African emissions reductions. Carbon trading is based on the idea that emissions of carbon dioxide in one place can be “offset” by expanding carbon capture activities in another, such as planting new trees or protecting forests to allow for their natural regeneration. This allows the big carbon emitters of the Global North to pay nature-rich countries in the Global South to preserve or expand forested areas. But a lot of these areas are inhabited by local people who use forests and land for their livelihoods and food. Carbon trading schemes effectively banish the people from their homelands and dispossess them of their rights in the name of preservation and carbon capture. It has already beenwell-documentedthat such schemes are failing to address rising carbon emissions and enable the greenwashing of rich corporations and nations who refuse to reduce their emissions. If carbon trading is not the solution, then how can the Global North support African countries to finance loss and damage, adaptation and mitigation? Cap and share is one alternative model that is gaining popularity among climate activists and civil society. The system centres around an international carbon tax that would make polluters – including fossil fuel extractors and major consumers – in the Global North pay. This tax, applied to fossil fuel extraction, would raise trillions of dollars a year for a global Green New Deal fund, which would finance the transition to renewables and support energy access for all. The fund’s income would also provide grants for loss and damage, adaptation and mitigation in the Global South, as well as universal cash transfers to support ordinary people. Cap and share would establish a taxation system that operates beyond the nation-state; doing so is key for climate justice and in many ways, it is long overdue. Modellingsuggeststhat the economic effects of a global carbon tax would be highly progressive, with Africa seeing substantial gains, including the permanent eradication of extreme poverty in all participating nations. This policy can be applied along with universal basic income and tax justice measures. As we move towards COP28, the mistakes of the Africa Climate Summit and other similar climate events should not be repeated. The voices of climate activists and civil society from the Global South need to be heard. We say no to carbon markets. We say no to selling Africa’s carbon, forests, and land to the North. We say yes to climate justice, and to climate finance that comes without strings attached.

On about a third of days in 2023, the average global temperature was at least 1.5C higher than pre-industrial levels.  Staying below that marker long-term is widely considered crucial to avoid the most damaging impacts of climate change.  But 2023 is ""on track"" to be the hottest year on record, and 2024 could be hotter. ""It is a sign that we're reaching levels we haven't been before,"" says Dr Melissa Lazenby, from the University of Sussex. This latest finding comes after record September temperatures and a summer of extreme weather events across much of the world.  When political leaders gathered in Paris in December 2015, they signed an agreement to keep the long-term rise in global temperatures this century ""well below"" 2C and to make every effort to keep it under 1.5C.  The agreed limits refer to the difference between global average temperatures now and what they were in the pre-industrial period, between 1850 and 1900 - before the widespread use of fossil fuels. Breaching these Paris thresholds doesn't mean going over them for a day or a week but instead involves going beyond this limit across a 20 or 30-year average.  This long-term average warming figure currently sits at around 1.1C to 1.2C.  But the more often 1.5C is breached for individual days, the closer the world gets to breaching this mark in the longer term. The first time this happened in the modern era was for a few days in December 2015, when politicians were signing the deal on the 1.5C threshold.  Since then the limit has been repeatedly broken, typically only for short periods. In 2016, influenced by a strong El Niño event - a natural climate shift that tends to increase global temperatures - the world saw around 75 days that went above that mark.  But BBC analysis of data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service shows that, up to 2 October, around 86 days in 2023 have been over 1.5C warmer than the pre-industrial average. That beats the 2016 record well before the end of the year.  There is some uncertainty in the exact number of days that have breached the 1.5C threshold, because the numbers reflect a global average which can come with small data discrepancies. But the margin by which 2023 has already passed 2016 figures gives confidence the record has already been broken.  ""The fact that we are reaching this 1.5C anomaly daily, and for a longer number of days, is concerning,"" said Dr Lazenby. One important factor in driving up these temperature anomalies is the onset of El Niño conditions. This was confirmed just a few months ago - although it is still weaker than its 2016 peak. These conditions are helping to pump heat from the eastern Pacific Ocean into the atmosphere. This may explain why 2023 is the first year in which the 1.5C anomaly has been recorded between June and October - when combined with the long-term warming from burning fossil fuels. ""This is the first time we're seeing this in the northern hemisphere summer, which is unusual, it's pretty shocking to see what's been going on,"" said Prof Ed Hawkins, from the University of Reading. ""I know our Australian colleagues are particularly worried about what's going to be the consequences for them with their summer approaching [for instance extreme wildfires], especially with El Niño."" Days when the temperature difference has exceeded 1.5C continued into September, with some more than 1.8C above the pre-industrial average.   The month as a whole was 1.75C above the pre-industrial level, and the year to date is around 1.4C above the 1850-1900 average, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service. While 2023 is ""on track"" to become the warmest year on record, it is not expected to breach the 1.5C warming threshold as a global average across the full 12 months. The world's oceans have also been experiencing unusually high temperatures this year and in turn, releasing further heat into the atmosphere.  ""The North Atlantic Ocean is the warmest we've ever recorded, and if you look at the North Pacific Ocean, there's a tongue of anomalously warm water stretching all the way from Japan to California,"" said Dr Jennifer Francis from the Woodwell Climate Research Centre in the US. While greenhouse gas emissions are increasing average temperatures, the precise reasons for why these sea temperatures have surged is not fully known.  One theory - which is still uncertain - is that a fall in air pollution from shipping across the North Atlantic has reduced the number of small particles and increased warming.  Up until now, these ""aerosols"" had been partly offsetting the effect of greenhouse gas emissions by reflecting some of the sun's energy and keeping the Earth's surface cooler than it would have been otherwise. Another perhaps less well-known factor is the situation around Antarctica.  There have been ongoing concerns about the state of sea ice around the coldest continent, with data showing the levels far below any previous winter. But according to some experts, two spikes in temperature in recent months in Antarctica - triggered by natural variability - have boosted the global average. However, it's difficult to identify the precise influence of long-term human-caused warming. ""In early July, Antarctica got really warm, they saw record temperatures, which is still 20 or 30 degrees Celsius below zero,"" said Dr Karsten Haustein, from the University of Leipzig. ""And what we see with 1.5C and 1.8C anomalies we are seeing now, it is partially down to Antarctica again."" While the northern hemisphere will naturally cool in autumn and winter, there is a view that the large temperature differences from the pre-industrial period may persist, especially as El Niño reaches a peak at the end of this year or early next.  Researchers believe that these ongoing high temperature anomalies should be a wake-up call for political leaders, who will gather in Dubai in November for the COP28 climate summit.  Action on emissions is needed, they say, and not just in the long-term.  In March, the UN urged countries to accelerate climate action, stressing effective options to reduce emissions were available now, from renewables to electric vehicles. ""It's not just about reaching an end goal, of net zero by 2050, it's about how we get there,"" said Prof Hawkins. ""The IPCC [the UN's climate body] very clearly says we need to halve emissions over this decade, and then get to net zero. It's not just about reaching net zero at some point, it's about the pathway to get there."" And as this year's extreme weather events have shown - from heatwaves in Europe to extreme rainfall in Libya - the consequences of climate change increase with every fraction of a degree of warming.",0.0,0.0

Yet, oil and gas majors are taking advantage of the EUs unrealistic targets for green hydrogen in order … [+6207 chars]",Mauritania,"A look at the top 100 highest spenders on EU lobbying reveals that the hydrogen lobby is particularly extravagant, shelling out a whopping €75.75 million per year.   To give some context, this is substantially more than what big tech (€43.5m) and big finance (€38.75m) declare in the top 100 for their annual lobby spending. The ranking sheds some light on the IEA’s newly released figures showing that an astounding 99% of globally produced hydrogen is made from fossil fuels. Yes, we are talking about the very same fossil fuels that are stoking the climate crisis. In 2022, the total global hydrogen production of 95 million tonnes (Mt) was responsible for over 900 Mt of carbon emissions. This exceeded the nearly 800 Mt that was emitted by the entire global aviation industry. Although the EU’s targets for green hydrogen are trumpeted with great fanfare — 20 million tonnes per year by 2030 — the fact is that current green hydrogen production around the world remains negligible. In 2022, less than 0.1% of global hydrogen (less than 0.08 million tonnes) was produced from renewable electricity. Over the past few years, hydrogen has been transformed into a cornerstone of EU energy policy. Let's look behind the scenes to see who is profiting from today's inflated targets, massive subsidies and support schemes. Meet Big Hydrogen Unsurprisingly, oil and gas majors like Shell, Total, ExxonMobil, BP, Equinor and their lobby groups figure on the list of the top 100 spenders on EU lobbying,  drawn from LobbyFacts data .  These interests, fully aware that hydrogen will continue to be mostly fossil-based in the coming years, have successfully hyped hydrogen as a silver bullet solution to the climate crisis. They are taking advantage of the EU’s unrealistic targets for green hydrogen in order to sneak fossil-based hydrogen in through the back door. They are building on their campaign to sell the so-called ""blue"" hydrogen — produced from fossil fuels, mainly gas, with part of the carbon emissions ""captured"" — as clean.  Although it is often described as a low-carbon, low-emissions, and even CO2-neutral gas, blue hydrogen is a climate killer.  In fact, when their total CO2 and methane emissions are added up, the climate footprint of blue and other fossil hydrogen is greater than the direct burning of fossil fuels. Yet it has become a lifeline for the fossil fuel industry. Other polluting industries with a vested interest in the hydrogen economy have also jumped on the bandwagon, including chemical and fertiliser corporations such as BASF, Dow, and Yara, and big players from the transport sector like BMW and the powerful ACEA car lobby.  Manufacturers including Siemens and Bosch are along for the ride, as is the influential Hydrogen Europe lobby group. In the increasingly urgent context of the climate crisis, the hydrogen hype offers a perfect cover for polluting companies.  Why reduce traffic, or transition to agroecological farming, or decommission fossil gas pipelines when hydrogen allows you to continue your dirty business? The slippery slope towards neo-colonialism The continuation of the fossil fuel era is not the only risk posed by the hydrogen hype. The EU’s hydrogen plans deepen neo-colonial extractivist practices, including the large-scale appropriation in producing countries of land, water, and energy that could otherwise be used to meet local electricity needs. in  a new report  by Corporate Europe Observatory, we look at projects with a planned production capacity of more than 1 gigawatt of green hydrogen. We found that 41 of the proposed 109 projects are planned in countries already facing high water stress, including Spain, Namibia, Chile and Morocco. According to industry figures, the production process consumes around 10 litres of ultra-pure water (requiring 20-30 litres of seawater or 12-13 litres of fresh water) for every produced kilogram of hydrogen.  This places additional demands on water in a context where food production and drinking water are already under stress. The wind and solar farms needed for the hydrogen economy also require vast areas of land. For example, with an area of 8,500 km2, the Aman project in Mauritania — one of the world’s biggest planned green hydrogen projects — covers more territory than many global megacities. Additionally, many of the countries that the EU considers as potential candidates for hydrogen imports produce little green energy.  For example, in the Gulf countries, less than 1% of the electricity came from renewables in 2022 (the exception is the United Arab Emirates, with 4.5%). A vision away from the resource-grabbing corporate economy of today For similar reasons, the African People’s Climate and Development Declaration, signed by over 500 African civil society groups in September 2023, rejects green hydrogen as a “false solution”, stating that “green hydrogen for export does nothing to increase access for the 600 million Africans without access to energy. Instead, it turns our African renewable energy into an exportable commodity and ships our energy overseas.” This is not to say that there is no role for green hydrogen. Mohamed Adow, who leads the climate think tank Power Shift Africa, outlines what he considers as a “socially, ecologically and economically appropriate use of hydrogen” in Africa: “small to medium scale, for domestic use (not for export), not in water-stressed regions, and to produce fertilisers for food sovereignty rather than for cash crops for export”. His vision could not be further from the resource-grabbing and corporate-controlled hydrogen economy currently under construction in the EU.  Yet, it seems that nobody is hearing him, or many others who might have a much healthier, resilient, and mindful vision for our joint future.

This differs from previousstudieson Great Barrier Reef corals, which found that naturally heat-tolerant symbionts could enhanceheat resistancein adult corals, but at a cost to its growth.Symbionts are the tiny cells of algae that live inside the coral tissue, providing corals with energy to grow. The survival of reef-building corals depends on this mutually beneficial relationship.The symbionts used in this study had their heat tolerance bolstered in the lab by exposing multiple generations to elevated temperatures for 10 years. Adult coral fragments of a single species called Galaxea fascicularsis, that had been chemically bleached, were then offered the heat-evolved symbionts. The scientists found that the symbionts were able to maintain a symbiosis with adult corals for two years, promoting faster coral recovery from bleaching and enhancing their heat tolerance without trading off on growth.Lead author on the study Dr. Wing Yan Chan from AIMS and the University of Melbourne said the new findings suggest that heat-evolved algal symbionts are a potentially valuable resource for reef restoration applicable across coral species and life stages.""These symbionts were still detected in the corals in moderate abundance two years after the corals were first inoculated, suggesting long-term stability of this symbiosis and potential long-term benefits to coral heat tolerance,"" she said.""Strategies to enhance coral heat tolerance can buy time for reefs, which are threatened by climate change-driven marine heat waves causing bleaching and sometimes mortality.

Such a united effort is desperately needed, even though the war in Ukraine and the latest Israel-Hamas war are taking away much of the international focus and hamper global unity and cooperation, Macron said.  The French leader spoke at the  Paris Peace Forum , an annual event involving governments, nongovernmental groups and others seeking dialogue around global problems such as climate change, children's exposure to online violence and threats to human rights.  The world, Macron said, is witnessing ""the collapse of the cryosphere under the impact of climate change,"" referring to parts of the Earth where water is in solid form, including glaciers.  ""The most immediate and visible effect is the melting of the ice caps ... it represents an unprecedented challenge for humanity,"" Macron said.  Melting ice surfaces worldwide have an impact on biodiversity, rising sea levels and coastlines, they contribute to scarcity of drinking water, migration, greater release of CO2 and risk of a new pandemic, he added.  ""All these threats are real,"" Macron said and called for urgent cooperation.  ""Conflicts are once again on the agenda, in the  Middle East  and elsewhere and this making our relations fragile, but we have to do our best to work closely together, in a peaceful way,"" he added.  Heads of states, governments and diplomats from about 40 states are attending the summit in Paris, including China. Russia has not been invited, even though the country is an Arctic neighbour.  In mountains from the Alps to the Himalayas, glaciers are disappearing at alarming rates due to warming temperatures, with many predicted to disappear entirely by the end of the century, according to studies.  While human-caused climate change means the loss of glacier mass is irreversible in the short-term, scientists say drastically reducing the burning of planet-warming coal, oil and gas could minimize the melt in the future.  It's a similarly stark picture on the Earth's poles. The Artic is rapidly losing sea ice as  global warming  causes the ice to weaken and disappear. The frozen  Antarctic  has also seen dramatic ice sheet melt, disappearing glaciers and unusually high temperatures as the world heats up. Experience Your Economic Times Newspaper, The Digital Way!

The summit had two main objectives: to build a global coalition to speed up the transition to clean energy, and to strengthen collaboration between these basins, which are considered the world's ‘ecological lungs’. A seven-point plan to protect tropical forests was announced by the participating countries. Various financing mechanisms were explored by the heads of intergovernmental organizations to help developing countries conserve their vital ecosystems. The participants emphasized the importance that tropical forests play in fighting back against global climate change. ""We have realized that joining forces is an absolute necessity, and we have recognized that the initiative to unite the three basins is part of an inevitable dynamic,"" Arlette Soudan-Nonault, the Republic of the Congo's environmental minister claimed. The World Wildlife Fund pointed out that it’s essential to engage in more efforts to cement and enhance collaboration between the three regions in order to foster real action to halt deforestation. According to the WWF director for the Congo Basin, Dr. Martin Kabaluapa Kapinga, the leaders of the Three Basins have to ""use this renewed momentum to foster concrete action to restore forests, bolster scientific and technical cooperation, stop and reverse biodiversity loss and adopt measures to address the climate crisis.” The Republic of the Congo signed a roadmap for partnership with the EU in forestry during the summit. The objective is to expand the area of protected, rehabilitated, or sustainably managed forests by 2030, generate more jobs in the industry, and decrease forest loss. These basins are responsible for approximately three-quarters of all global biodiversity and 80% of the world's forest cover. Over 3,000 participants, including government representatives, international organizations, NGOs, researchers, scientists and others, took part in this event. Among the African leaders present were the leaders of the DR Congo, Kenya, Sao Tome and Principe, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Burundi, Ghana, Comoros, the Central African Republic and Gabon. The Ministers of Foreign Affairs from Colombia and Venezuela were also present. The initiative was applauded by French President Emmanuel Macron, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and former Brazilian President Lula via video conference. The journey to Brazzaville was made by none of the heads of state from the Amazon Basin. The ‘Three Basins Summit’ was held ahead of COP28, which is scheduled to take place in November in the United Arab Emirates.",1.0,0.0

Nearly a third of that renewable energy should come from wind and solar power, said the report by researchers of Berlin-based Agora Energiewende. A fifth would be hydropower and other clean sources and the remainder, fossil fuels. The study analyzed energy plans of both developing nations like Indonesia andVietnam, where demand for energy is growing rapidly, and wealthier places likeJapanand South Korea, which have among the highest burdens of per capita greenhouse gas emissions. It did not include China, the world's biggest emitter of carbon, or India, another major contributor. A global temperature increase of 1.5C (2.7F) since pre-industrial times is considered a critical climate threshold beyond which risks of catastrophes rise. The world will likely lose most of its coral reefs, a key ice sheet could kick into irreversible melt, and water shortages, heat waves and death from extreme weather may surge, according to an earlier United Nations scientific report. Agora Energiewende researchers found that Asian nations are united in their heavy reliance on fossil fuels and national plans are not aligned with ambitious climate pledges announced by their governments. By using proven technologies like wind and solar power, countries can avoid exceeding limits they have set and also limit investment in fossil fuel infrastructure they won't need, said Mathis Rogner, the Southeast Asia project lead for Agora Energiewende and a co-author of the report. To conform with 1.5C (2.7F) limit, the nine countries included in the study need to add 45 to 55 gigawatts of solar energy and 20 gigawatts of wind energy every year. In 2021, they had installed a total of just 11.9 gigawatts of solar energy and 1.5 gigawatts of wind energy. The study reviewed energy plans of Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Taiwan. As of the end of 2022, the U.S. had installed capacity of more than 144 GW of wind power and 110 GW of solar photovoltaic power. The need for urgent action was echoed by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called for a “climate ambition supernova” after a U.N. analysis released Tuesday found that countries’ climate plans still lagged far behind what was needed. Much of the clean energy capacity the world has added since 2016 has been concentrated in the U.S., China and India. Even though wind and solar technologies have been getting cheaper every year, among other Asian nations, only Japan and Vietnam derive more than a tenth of their capacity from the wind and the sun. The vast increases in Chinese and Indian renewable energy capacity are an example for other Asian countries that lag behind. They also show how such transitions can create jobs and improve energy security, said Kanika Chawla, chief of staff at Sustainable Energy for All, the United Nations’ sustainable energy unit, who was not involved in the report. Many countries still rely heavily on large hydropower dams, which can involve hefty social and environmental costs and are vulnerable to drought. The report estimates that South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia each should add between 8 and 14 gigawatts of solar power annually. Indonesia now gets less than 1% of its power from wind and solar energy, according to a study by the U.K.-based thinktank Ember. South Korea and Thailand also still mostly depend on fossil fuel. Japan needs to add an average of 9 gigawatts of solar power a year and Vietnam, around 10 gigawatts, to meet end-of-the-decade targets. But the report says the goals are achievable since both countries have managed similar increases in the past. The report says Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines need to add between 1 and 3 gigawatts of energy from the sun each year to their grid. South Korea needs the biggest spurt in wind power — an average increase of 8 gigawatts each year — while Japan needs to add about 3 gigawatts. Vietnam should be deploying around 4 gigawatts in new wind power capacity, the report said. Lower potential for wind power in other countries means they should target between one and 2 gigawatts each year. The report calls for a “paradigm shift” to speed up the transition to wind and solar power. That would include removing subsidies for oil and gas that make renewables less competitive, simplifying bureaucratic hurdles such as permits and facilitating investments. At the same time, power grids need to be upgraded to allow for the variability and unpredictability of wind and solar power, it said. Despite a common misconception that wind and solar are more expensive and less stable than fossil fuel-powered generation, “Our analysis shows that often much higher shares of wind and solar can be reliably integrated into the power system than the operators expect,” Rogner of Agora said. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Months of … [+2402 chars]",Climate,"The global average temperature on Friday was more than two degrees Celsius hotter than pre-industrial levels for the first time on record, Europe's Copernicus climate monitor said Monday. Months of extraordinary heat is expected to make 2023 the hottest year in history, with droughts, massive wildfires and fierce storms ravaging swathes of the planet. According to provisional data, global temperatures on November 17 were 2.06C above the pre-industrial average, Samantha Burgess, Deputy Head of the EU's Climate Change Service (C3S) said on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""This was the first day when global temperature was more than 2C above 1850-1900 levels,"" she added. The 2015 Paris Agreement enshrined the goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels and to aim for a safer 1.5C. One day above 2C does not mean that the Paris threshold has been breached -- the deal instead refers to change measured over decades. Climate experts have since urged the world to aim for the lower limit to avoid major climate impacts, such as heatwaves, super hurricanes and melting ice caps. They defined warming as ""the increase in the 30-year global average"" relative to the average from 1850 to 1900. The current climate is considered to have warmed by nearly 1.2C compared to that reference period. The first day to exceed the 2C target is part of a series of records this year: October was the warmest ever recorded globally, as was every month since June, according to Copernicus, which said that 2023 would with ""near certainty"" surpass the hottest year on record set in 2016. Beyond these official records, scientists say proxy data for the climate going back further -- like tree rings or ice cores -- suggests the temperatures seen this year could be unprecedented in human history, potentially the warmest in more than 100,000 years. October was 1.7C warmer than an estimate of that month's average for the pre-industrial era, Copernicus said earlier this month. And global average temperatures since January have been the highest in records going back to 1940, the monitor added, registering 1.43C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average. Leaders meeting November 30 to December 12 in the United Arab Emirates for the COP28 conference will have to respond to a damning progress report on the world's Paris pledges after major scientific studies have made clear the world is far off track. The conference is expected to draw up the first official assessment of the Paris Agreement and, if possible, corrective measures.",-1.0,0.0

In a world where the impact of  climate change  is becoming increasingly evident, it's crucial to educate the younger generation about environmental issues. The challenge lies in making these serious topics accessible and engaging for children. Traditional methods often fall short, but a fresh approach is emerging to tackle this dilemma – blending education with entertainment. According to a recent study, children are more likely to grasp complex concepts when they're presented in a fun and interactive manner. The study highlights the importance of incorporating humor, play, and creativity into educational content to capture children's attention and sustain their interest.  Kids  are naturally curious, and when you tap into that curiosity with engaging and enjoyable activities, they absorb information effortlessly. This new strategy aligns with the concept of ' edutainment ,' where education meets entertainment. By integrating entertaining elements into the educational process, we can create an environment that not only educates but also fosters a genuine interest in serious topics such as  climate  change. ""Combining education and entertainment is a powerful tool to raise awareness and inspire action among the younger generation. Kids are more likely to remember important information when it's presented in a way that resonates with them,"" Tamseel Hussain, CEO of creator platform PlucTV and Colin Butfield, of Studio Silverback said. ""We all know about the climate and nature crisis. We hear the warnings and we live with its effects. But how inspired are we to do something about it? It is easy and indeed human nature to focus on the bad news, the pessimism, especially when the worst effects of climate change are an awful daily reality. But when words like “crisis” are used so often they become white noise — they lose their power, we become overwhelmed, lose our motivation to act, and we give up. This is not the time to give up. This is the time to act, to be creative, to bring forward solutions, to double down on our resolve to do everything in our power to save the planet,"" Hussain said. Experts suggest that incorporating interactive games, animated videos, and hands-on activities into the curriculum can make a significant difference. Interactive experiences allow children to connect with the information on a personal level, making it more likely to leave a lasting impression. ""Relaying the climate crisis is both a communications challenge as well as a scientific one. The climate story needs to evolve from its current narrative of overwhelming disconnection. The future of our planet — and how it is possible to save it — is a story worth telling. We need stories that show real life — and real life as it could be,"" Hussian emphasised.  The out of box approach doesn't just stop at schools; parents and guardians play a pivotal role in reinforcing these lessons at home.  Indians have, for long, functioned on principles of flexibility and resilience, commonly known as  Jugaad , which pervades the response of many Indian citizens to the climate crisis as well.  This jugaad philosophy is inspiring innovations across the country, from finding innovative ways to save an endangered species, supplying electricity using renewable sources to remote communities, or a new kind of ecotourism, young Indian innovators are at the forefront of a movement that deserves greater focus – because it is this creativity that has the ability to inspire others to action. The Studio Silverback has launched a campaign Planet India, a visual storytelling campaign which aims to inspire climate action by sharing the stories of the amazing people across India who are taking action to protect their natural environment.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said it was the largest federal investment ever in grid infrastructure, supporting projects that will harden electric systems and improve energy reliability and affordability. The federal spending, combined with money promised by private partners, could result in up to $8 billion in investments nationally to upgrade the grid, Granholm said. “The grid, as it currently sits, is not is not equipped to handle all the new demand” and withstand natural disasters and extreme weather worsened byclimate change, Granholm said at a news conference Wednesday. “We need it to be bigger, we need it to be stronger, we need it to be smarter” to bring a range of renewable energy projects online and meet the Biden administration’s goal of reaching 100% clean electricity by 2035, she said. Projects funded by the federalGrid Resilience and Innovation Partnershipsprogram will increase the flexibility, efficiency and reliability of electric power systems, with a particular focus on spurring solar, wind, and other renewable energy, Granholm said. The projects also are aimed at fixing problems that may contribute to wildfires and other disasters and will improve reliability by deploying innovative approaches to electricity transmission, storage and distribution, she and other officials said. Projects to be funded include $249 million each for rural areas in Georgia and Louisiana and $250 million for a Native American tribe in Oregon. The largest grant, $464 million, will go to improve five transmission projects across seven Midwestern states, from Iowa to North Dakota. The money includes $95 million previously announced for Hawaii in the wake of devastating wildfires this summer, and $150 million to PacifiCorp to upgrade the grid in California, Oregon, Utah and other states. “Our outdated grid has been in need of an update for a long, long time,″ said Mitch Landrieu, a White House senior adviser who coordinates implementation of the2021 infrastructure lawsigned by President Joe Biden. The grid “is especially vulnerable to the increasing impacts of the climate crisis,” Landrieu added. “Older equipment can overload during extreme heat and cold when power is needed most. And it’s more likely to fail when communities are washed out by historic floods and decimated by stronger storms.'' The nation's existing power grids are not built to handle the growing energy demand, a fact that is complicated by the intermittent nature of renewables, since energy isn’t generated when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind isn’t blowing. “As we sadly saw in California, aging electricity infrastructure can cause catastrophic loss of life, property, natural areas and forest fires,” said Jonathan Foley, executive director of Project Drawdown, a San Francisco-based group that publicizes climate solutions. The projects announced Wednesday are “exactly the kind of thing that we should be doing: promoting renewables, better storage and better electrical grids for a better, greener, more resilient future,” Foley said. In Georgia, the state's environmental finance authority and companies that supports Georgia's electric cooperatives will team up on a project to upgrade the grid, including investments in battery storage, local microgrids, grid reliability and new transmission lines. The project will focus on remote, historically underinvested communities, Granholm said, including rural Locust Grove, Georgia, where she visited Wednesday as part of the grant rollout. In Louisiana, two projects will focus on helping disadvantaged communities withstand extreme weather and develop microgrids to work with local utilities and back up existing assets. Entergy New Orleans also will enhance the local grid’s resilience to severe weather, including hardening existing transmission lines and distribution systems to reduce outage frequency and duration. CPS Energy in San Antonio will receive $30 million for a resiliency program, and Minnesota-based Xcel Energy will receive $100 million for projects in Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Minnesota and Wisconsin to improve wildfire risk mitigation, including thousands of fire-resistant poles, tree clearing and wind strength testing. Texas has faced repeated challenges, from sweltering heat this summer to a winter blackout in 2021 that knocked out power to millions of customers for days and resulted in hundreds of deaths. In Michigan, DTE Energy will deploy adaptive microgrids in the Detroit area to enhance reliability and reduce outages. In southeastern Pennsylvania, PECO Energy Co. will increase grid reliability and resilience through substation flood mitigation and replacing aging infrastructure. In Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs Reservation will work with Portland General Electric to upgrade transmission capacity and improve service east of the Cascade Mountains, including the reservation. ___ Associated Press writer Isabella O'Malley in New York contributed to this story.",1.0,0.0

Nelson will also meet with space officials in both countries to deepen  bilateral cooperation  across a broad range of innovation and research-related areas, especially in human exploration and Earth science, the American space agency NASA said in a release. Nelson's visit to India will fulfil a commitment as part of the US and India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology initiated by President Joe Biden.  In the India leg, Nelson will visit several locations, including the Bengaluru-based facilities where the  NISAR spacecraft , a joint Earth-observing mission between NASA and its Indian counterpart  ISRO , is undergoing testing and integration for launch in 2024.  NISAR is short for NASA ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar. As the first satellite mission between NASA and ISRO, NISAR is a revolutionary Earth-observing instrument, the first in the Earth System Observatory, that will measure Earth's changing ecosystems, dynamic surfaces, and ice masses, providing information about biomass, natural hazards, sea level rise, and groundwater, key information to guide efforts related to climate change, hazard mitigation, agriculture, and more. Laurie Leshin, director, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),  National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA), recently told that scientists from both space agencies -- ISRO and NASA -- are working closely on the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission to help make sure that they make the most out of the data that will be coming down from the spacecraft. ""We are so excited to be working between NASA and ISRO on NISAR, which is a radar machine to looks at the surface of the earth and how it is changing. In India, they are interested in understanding how the mangrove environment at the coasts is changing. We will understand how ice sheets are changing and how earthquakes and volcanoes are happening all over the world...There are many different aspects to understanding our earth better,"" Leshin told ANI in Bengaluru earlier this month. NISAR is an equal collaboration between NASA and ISRO and marks the first time the two agencies have cooperated on hardware development for an Earth-observing mission. About the size of an SUV and partially wrapped in gold-coloured thermal blanketing, the satellite's cylindrical radar instrument payload contains two radar systems. While in the UAE, Nelson will also participate in the 2023  United Nations Climate Change Conference . It will be the first time a NASA administrator has attended the conference. Also, during the visit, students in each country will have the opportunity to meet with Nelson to discuss science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and their roles as members of the Artemis Generation.

Scientists worry that climate change -triggered melt from Antarctica and Greenland will cause dangerous and significant sea rise over many decades and centuries.""Knowing exactly how, and how much, ice is being lost from these protective floating shelves is a key step in understanding how Antarctica is evolving,"" said University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos, who wasn't part of the study.Scambos said the study gives insight intofresh waterthat's melting into the Amundsen Sea—""the key region of Antarctica for sea level rise""—that not only adds height to the ocean, but makes it less dense and salty.The biggest culprits were giant icebergs breaking off in 1999, 2000 and 2002 that were the size of Delaware, he said. The study also looks at ice melting fromwarm waterbelow.Ice shelves are floating extensions of glaciers that act ""like the gatekeepers"" and keep the larger glacier from flowing more quickly into the water, the study's lead author said.This satellite image provided by NASA, shows icebergs that formed through an ice shelf collapse. Dozens of Antarctica’s ice shelves, floating extensions of glaciers, showed significant shrinking between 1997 and 2021, a study published Thursday, Oct. 12, 2023, found. Credit: Dr. Christopher A. Shuman, UMBC/NASA via AP, FileAll told, Antarctic ice shelves lost about 8.3 trillion tons (7.5 trillion metric tons) of ice in the 25-year period, the study found. That amounts to around 330 billion tons (300 billion metric tons) a year and is similar to previous studies.But the overall total is not the real story, said study lead author Benjamin Davison, a glaciologist at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom.What's most important, he said, are the patterns of individual shelf loss. The new study shows the deep losses, with four glaciers losing more than a trillion tons on the continent's peninsula and western side.""Some of them lost a lot of their mass over time,"" Davison said. ""Wordie is barely an ice shelf anymore.""The Wordie ice shelve, which holds back four glaciers near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, had a big collapse in 1989, but has lost 87% of its remaining mass since 1997, Davison found. Neighboring Larsen A has lost 73% and Larsen B 57%. The largest of the Larsen ice shelves, Larsen C, has lost 1.8 billion tons (1.7 trillion metric tons) of ice, about one-eighth of its mass.The biggest loss of all is in the Thwaites ice shelf, holding back the glacier nicknamed Doomsday because it is melting so fast and is so big. The shelf has lost 70% of its mass since 1997—about 4.1 trillion tons (3.7 trillion metric tons)—into the Amundsen Sea.The ice shelves that grew were predominantly on the continent's east side, where there's a weather pattern isolates the land from warmer waters, Davison said.

More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm. Some children, like 10-year-old Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim, are already on the move. Her family left their home in Somalia after dawn prayers on a Saturday morning five months ago. The worst drought in more than 50 years scorched the once-fertile pastures the family relied on, leaving them barren. So, bundling only a few clothes and some utensils into sacks, they moved to a camp in the capital Mogadishu, where Ibrahim, who dreams of being a doctor, is now going to school for the first time. That’s a plus, but the camp lacks proper shelter and sanitation, and food is scarce. “We need something that can protect us from the heat during the day and the cold at night,” Ibrahim said. Read more:U.N. Climate Warning Also Comes With Clear Steps To Cut Emissions The miseries of long, drawn-out disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report — more than half of them in Somalia — but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no pre-emptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide,climate changehas already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines; storms are battering megacities and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. “The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in (the) future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify,” said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the report's authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 2016-21 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. Floods displaced children more than 19 million times in places like India and China. Wildfires impacted children 810,000 times in the U.S. and Canada. Data tracking migrations because of weather extremes typically don't differentiate between children and adults. UNICEF worked with a Geneva-based nonprofit, the International Displacement Monitoring Center, to map where kids were most impacted. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. Those countries also have vast populations and strong systems to evacuate people, which makes it easier for them to record data. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring “overlapping crises” — where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. During unprecedented flooding of the Yamuna River in July in the Indian capital New Delhi, churning waters washed away the hut that was home to 10-year-old Garima Kumar’s family. The waters also took her school uniform and her school books. Kumar lived with her family on sidewalks of the megacity and missed a month of school. “Other students in the school teased me because my house had been flooded. Because we don’t have a permanent home,” Kumar said. The floodwaters have receded and the family began repairing their home last month — a process Garima’s mother Meera Devi said they are having to do over and over again as floods are becoming more common. Her father, Shiv Kumar, hasn’t had any work for over a month. The family's only income is the mother’s $2 daily earnings as a domestic helper. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnam-based expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasn’t involved with the report. “When you’re desperate, you do things that you normally wouldn’t do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they don’t have the ability to stand up for themselves,” she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become “shock-responsive, portable and inclusive,” to help children and their families better cope with disasters. This would mean considering children’s needs at different stages, from ensuring they have opportunities to study, that they can stay with their families and that eventually they can find work. “We have the tools. We have the knowledge. But we’re just not working fast enough,” Healy said.",-1.0,-1.0

 Ev… [+4570 chars]",United Arab Emirates,"Every year since 1995, the Conference of the Parties, or COP, has brought together the member states of the United Nations to discuss climate issues.  And in 2015, during COP21, the Paris Agreement marked a turning point in the fight against global warming.  For the first time, all of the United Nations member states committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, with the ambitious goal of keeping global warming below 2°C by 2100. It was no longer a question of debates, observations or declarations of intent, but a real commitment, with figures, made in front of the whole world, for observers and future generations to see. It was also a great success for European and French diplomacy, which managed to get the world's most polluting nations to sign up for the agreement. Yet, here we are But eight years have passed. Successive COPs have made little meaningful progress, and most of the progress in the fight against global warming is now being organised elsewhere, in other institutions, at other events, in bilateral relations between states, or simply under pressure from public opinion. The framework set by governments is blatantly clear: it is up to them to implement it, and it is up to businesses to rise to the challenge.   Meanwhile, COP became emblematic of a format of major diplomatic symposia that have run out of steam, and its inherent limitations are about to be demonstrated by the upcoming event in the United Arab Emirates. The model — bringing together all the world's nations, which is inherently laborious and complex — may have been effective in 2015, but it is now showing its limits: no global agreement has been signed since. Worse still, the COP model now appears to be counterproductive, gradually becoming the symbol of a grand diplomatic rave against a backdrop of greenwashing. COP28, to be held in Dubai in November and December, is the most caricatured example of this. Emirates as organisers, Emirates as polluters It will be difficult to convince European, Asian, African or American public opinion to opt for a more sober growth model coming from the United Arab Emirates.  The small Gulf petro-monarchy, with a population of just ten million, is the sixth largest per capita emitter of CO2 in the world, at 22 tonnes per person per year.  The UAE is also the world's seventh-largest oil producer, producing and exporting nearly 4,000 barrels a day. It is difficult to give one's blessing to an event dedicated to the fight against global warming organised by one of the world's biggest polluters and, to add insult to injury, chaired by one of the country's biggest polluters, Sultan Al-Jaber, who is both President of COP28 and CEO of ADNOC, the national oil company of the UAE. In an open letter to world leaders and the UN on 23 May, hundreds of European and US parliamentarians called for the withdrawal of Sultan Al-Jaber as president of COP28, yet to no avail. Turning an ecological aberration into a historic opportunity Under these conditions, and in order to avoid fuelling future diplomatic and ecological disillusionment, we urgently need to move on.  It's time to opt for new political models to advance the fight against global warming and break our dependence on fossil fuels. Different, more flexible and more regional summits and organisations must emerge to collectively achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Europe was in the driving seat in 2015, helping COP21 to deliver a framework to structure our climate goals for the coming century.  From this point onward, French and European diplomacy must continue to assume their responsibilities by promoting the emergence of new institutions that will eventually replace the repeated COP agreements, which combine meaninglessness with impotence. Let's not give our blessing to this COP28, which will discredit the fight against global warming.  On the contrary, let's help the states, companies and NGOs of the five continents to set up new forms of organisation, adapted to their regional realities and genuinely effective in achieving our climate objectives.  Europe has the opportunity to show its difference, to demonstrate its values and to make its citizens proud. Let's make history and serve the planet.

At the event, Lassila & Tikanoja’s President and CEO Eero Hautaniemi and other members of the Group Executive Board will provide up-to-date information about the company’s business operations, renewed strategy and plan for achieving the confirmed financial targets. Growth from circular economy business The Environmental Services and Industrial Services divisions are seeking new growth especially by investing in the circular economy of materials. Growth will be sought from business development and potential complementary acquisitions. The Environmental Services division’s strong market position, broad customer base and significant material volumes provide a good basis for growing the materials business. As for material streams, the division will continue to focus on plastic, wood waste and metals, but opportunities related to other streams are also being explored. In the Industrial Services division, new business opportunities are emerging around the processing and value increase of industrial flows, as well as the restoration of the built environment. Growth is also sought in the Swedish market in industrial services and material value chains. Facility Services Finland and Facility Services Sweden will focus on improving profitability. In October 2023, Lassila & Tikanoja announced that the company’s Board of Directors had decided to evaluate the strategic alternatives for Facility Services Finland and Facility Services Sweden as part of the company’s business portfolio development. The sale of operations is one possible option. “To slow climate change and biodiversity loss, society and companies must take circular economy action, and this provides opportunities for L&T’s business. We will focus on improving profitability and building growth in the circular economy of materials. By moving forward in the materials value chain, we can create value for both our customers and our shareholders,” says Eero Hautaniemi, President and CEO of Lassila & Tikanoja. Long-term financial targets remain the same Financial targets Lassila & Tikanoja does not consider the long-term financial targets as guidance for any fiscal year. Sustainability and stakeholder targets In October 2023, L&T updated its environmental sustainability target. The target is to halve the emissions of our own operations by 2030 from the level in 2018 and to reduce indirect (Scope 3) emissions by 18% by 2030 from the level in 2022. The company has set itself a net-zero emissions target by 2045. Sustainability and stakeholder measures are reported as part of the Group’s quarterly and annual reporting.

Follow him on Twitter at @DanLambe.   As the fight against climate change has grown increasingly urgent, so has the need for innovative leaders to step up and help implement nature-based solutions. Thankfully, more and more private sector leaders are taking a seat at the table, leveling up their engagement. Many have started with a look inward, changing the way they do business to prioritize sustainability and lessen negative impacts on the environment. The effect of these decisions can ripple out and influence the behavior of consumers. We want private sector leaders to know their impact can extend beyond the sphere of their business. Corporations have the power to alter the trajectory of conservation initiatives by leveraging their platform of influence. By steering public attention and funding toward a wide spectrum of sustainability work, companies can create real, lasting change all over the world. At the Arbor Day Foundation, we’ve found that a growing number of companies are using a seemingly simple solution to make an impact while simultaneously meeting their sustainability goals. That solution? Trees. Often used as a method to capture and store carbon, trees are a scalable and cost-effective tool in the fight against climate change. Researchers have repeatedly lauded trees as a solution to tackling the climate crisis. In one study, scientists estimated that new forests could capture two-thirds of all human carbon emissions. And the power of a tree doesn’t stop there. Trees can also advance biodiversity, reduce life-threatening heat, filter air pollution and improve the mental and physical health of the people living near them. Though rooted in a single spot, the impact of a tree reaches much further. By helping to plant trees in the right place and at the right time, companies can maximize the potential of their investment to yield the most benefits for the climate and the world. Trees also help bring people together. Planting trees is a unifying, impartial act, devoid of prejudice and politics. They are a meaningful contribution to the health of future generations and an honest indication of hope. Whether it’s through urban forestry in massive city centers or reforestation in a faraway forest, trees add value. There are tangible, unignorable results tied to tree planting. This is not a “greenwashing” promise. Companies that choose to support tree planting can witness the living proof of the real impact they’re making. For someone who believes that their company values and sustainability objectives align with tree planting, it’s crucial to start the process with a sense of intention. You know you want to plant trees. Now, the next step is to ask: What do you hope to achieve with those trees? Are you striving to foster critical wildlife habitat, assist in reforesting scorched land after a wildfire, reduce life-threatening heat in underserved communities or something else entirely? The most successful tree-planting projects are focused on the desired outcome right from the very beginning. At times, private sector leaders eager to boast big pledges may focus too much on the number of trees planted rather than the positive impact those trees can bring. While we do need millions and millions of more trees, to fully realize the power of those trees we must consider where to plant them and how they’ll positively impact communities and the environment. Sometimes, companies know exactly where and how they want to use trees to make a difference. Sometimes, they have no idea where to start. And that is perfectly okay. I urge private sector leaders to remember they don’t have to know exactly how to make it happen. Forestry is a team sport. Corporate leaders should seek out conservationists and foresters to help guide them on where they can make the most impact. Companies should also look to each other. For those new to tree planting, it’s advisable to engage in knowledge-sharing sessions with like-minded corporate peers. These conversations can assist in identifying the most impactful way for you to participate in tree planting. Over time, you will be able to carve out a clearer sense of purpose behind your desire to plant trees. Eventually, you'll be able to progress from “I want to plant trees” to “I want to plant trees in an international forest” to “I want to plant trees in Madagascar to help preserve critical habitat for endangered lemurs.” There are endless directions to take in a corporation's journey, and no matter the path selected, defining the objective is a key part of establishing a legacy of impact. Because then, the work is not just about planting trees in the ground; it's about using trees as a vehicle for change.

The research, by a team of British and Brazilian scientists, led by Dr. Edward Butt at the University of Leeds, suggests that tropical forests play a critical role in cooling the land surface—and that effect can play out over considerable distances.It is known that when tropical forests are cleared, the climate in the immediate vicinity gets warmer.In this latest study, the researchers wanted to know if deforestation in the Amazon was resulting in climate warming further afield, and the study examined the impact of forest loss on sites up to 100 kilometers away.Critical importanceDr. Butt, a research fellow based in the School of Earth and Environment at Leeds, said, ""Understanding the impact of forest loss in the Amazon is of critical importance.""The world is getting warmer as a result of climate change. It is important that we understand how deforestation of the Amazon ecosystem is contributing toclimate warming. If deforestation is warming surrounding regions, this would have big implications for people living in those areas.""As part of the study the researchers combined satellite data ofland surfacetemperature and forest loss in the Amazon for the period 2001 to 2020. The study, ""Amazon deforestation causes strong regional warming,"" was reported in the journalProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Data was analyzed at 3.7 million locations across the Amazon basin. The researchers compared the warming that had occurred over regions with varying amounts of local and regional deforestation.The researchers classed deforestation within 2km of a data collection point as local. If it was further afield, between 2 and 100 kilometers away, it was classed as regional.Cumulative impact of regional forest lossAnalyzing the data, the scientists found that in those areas where there was little deforestation both locally and regionally, the average change in land temperature over the 2001 to 2021 period was 0.3°C. Locations with 40% to 50% local deforestation but little regional deforestation, warmed by an average of 1.3°C.In comparison, in areas with both local and regional deforestation, the average temperature rise was 4.4°C.Writing in the paper, the researchers added, ""The regional warming due to Amazon deforestation will have negative consequences for the 30 million people living within the Amazon basin, many of whom are already exposed to dangerous levels of heat.""Impact of Amazon deforestationThe scientists also analyzed how future deforestation might further warm the Brazilian Amazon over the 30 years from 2020. They looked at two scenarios, one where the Forest Code is ignored and protected areas not safeguarded. The second, where there is some protection in place.In the southern Amazon, where forest loss is the greatest, reducing deforestation would have the biggest benefit reducing future warming by more than 0.5°C in Mato Grosso state.Professor Dominick Spracklen, from the University of Leeds and a co-author in the study, said, ""It is well known that protectingtropical forestsis crucial in the fight against global climate change. Our work shows that protecting forests will also have big benefits at a local, regional and national scale.""We show that reducing deforestation would reduce future warming across the southern Amazon. This would benefit people living across the region through reducing heat stress and reducing the negative impacts on agriculture.""Dr. Celso von Randow, a researcher from the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research and a co-author of the study, said, ""In Brazil, studies on the importance of conserving forests for carbon storage are common, but we still lack studies on their biophysical effects. This is important because the Amazon is warming rapidly due to climate change, and now exacerbated by deforestation.""New efforts to control deforestation across the Brazilian Amazon have been successful and deforestation rates have declined over the last year, and now we see benefits of possibly reducing the warming affecting people living in this region. Recognizing such benefits will hopefully result in more widespread support for continued efforts to reducedeforestationand protect forests.""",-1.0,0.0

Atos to develop responsible IT solutions for WWF and its partners Atos and WWF have defined the following projects by which conservation organizations and other stakeholders could benefit from Atos’ technological expertise. Atos and WWF to help advance decarbonization initiatives for industries Atos and WWF have envisioned to analyze every year, an industry which has a significant carbon footprint, to identify its main decarbonization levers and provide recommendations to accelerate their decarbonization efforts. The first report focuses on shipping, which accounted for around 80% of global trade by volume in 2022, and is responsible for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions*. Since the publication of the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee's new greenhouse gas (GHG) strategy in July 2023, Atos and WWF teams have compiled the literature devoted to the decarbonization of shipping into a comprehensive report. They found that most research focuses on new fuels and ship design, initiatives that could take a long time to have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions. In order to provide sustainability leaders with a clear and more achievable mid-term roadmap, the research focuses on energy efficiency, operational levers and concrete use cases where digital technology can help the shipping industry decarbonize its operations. Atos to support on-site WWF France biodiversity projects As part of the partnership, Atos supports two carbon capture and restoration projects managed by WWF France: Atos and WWF to encourage employee involvement in sustainability projects driven by WWF Many of Atos employees are already regularly involved in volunteer work and environmental preservation. Atos and WWF aim to facilitate and encourage their commitment with a dedicated program that will integrate onsite and digital volunteering opportunities in one platform compliant with CSR reporting frameworks. The first engagement programs for Atos employees will be launched in pilot countries in 2024. Kirsten Schuijt, Director General WWF,said “The devastating impacts of climate change and nature loss are felt everywhere. This dual crisis requires urgent, innovative and scalable solutions. Technology, if channeled in the right way, has the enormous potential to help address some of the pressing challenges we face today. We're excited about this new partnership with Atos as it will enable us to collaborate on advancing much-needed technological tools to support our efforts to stop and reverse nature loss at a policy level and in the field.” Véronique Andrieux, CEO WWF France,said ""We are very excited to announce our partnership with Atos, which is already delivering results on optimizing and increasing the reach of some of WWF's conservation projects. Helping us better identify changes in the habitats of Key Biodiversity Areas or modernizing some of the data collection and analysis tools used by our wildlife conservation teams are some of the outcomes already achieved by our common work. Our partnership with Atos represents a significant step forward, enabling us to harness technology for helping deliver our conservation objectives."" Nourdine Bihmane, Deputy CEO Atos and CEO Tech Foundations,said“We are excited to announce this strategic partnership with WWF which is in line with our respective ambitions and expertise. Atos has been committed for over 12 years to decarbonize its own operations as well as accompany its customers in their own efforts. I am extremely proud that our technological expertise is being put to work to accelerate decarbonization strategies and support WWF's conservation practices and biodiversity projects worldwide.” The Atos Group has been committed to minimize the environmental impact of its activities across the value chain worldwide for over 12 years. Atos’ main ambitions are to fully contribute to a more decarbonized and sustainable world by reducing and offsetting its own carbon emissions and to promote digital solutions that support its supply chain and clients in their own decarbonization journeys. The partnership with WWF, run by the Tech Foundations business line, is fully aligned with these objectives. The Atos Group has been a member of both the 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability Index World and Europe for 8 years, and ranks among the first 3 European companies in the IT services sector. Atos has been listed A for more than 10 years by the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), which rewards actions to fight global warming. * Source : https://sciencebasedtargets.org/news/sbti-launches-world-first-roadmap-for-net-zero-shipping-by-2040 *** About Atos Atosis a global leader in digital transformation with 105,000 employees and annual revenue of c. € 11 billion.

Extreme heat, air pollution and the increasing spread of deadly infectious diseases are just some of the reasons why the World Health Organization has called climate change the single biggest health threat facing humanity. Global warming must be limited to the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees Celsius ""to avert catastrophic health impacts and prevent millions of climate change-related deaths"", according to the WHO. However, under current national carbon-cutting plans, the world is on track to warm up to 2.9C this century, the UN said this week. While no one will be completely safe from the effects of climate change, experts expect that most at risk will be children, women, the elderly, migrants and people in less developed countries which have emitted the least planet-warming greenhouse gases. On December 3, the COP28 negotiations in Dubai will host the first ""health day"" ever held at the climate negotiations. This year is widely expected to be the hottest on record. And as the world continues to warm, even more frequent and intense heatwaves are expected to follow. Heat is believed to have caused more than 70,000 deaths in Europe during summer last year, researchers said this week, revising the previous number up from 62,000. Worldwide, people were exposed to an average of 86 days of life-threatening temperatures last year, according to the Lancet Countdown report earlier this week. The number of people over 65 who died from heat rose by 85 percent from 1991-2000 to 2013-2022, it added. And by 2050, more than five times more people will die from the heat each year under a 2C warming scenario, the Lancet Countdown projected. More droughts will also drive rising hunger. Under the scenario of 2C warming by the end of the century, 520 million more people will experience moderate or severe food insecurity by 2050. Meanwhile, other extreme weather events such as storms, floods and fires will continue to threaten the health of people across the world. Almost 99 percent of the world's population breathes air that exceeds the WHO's guidelines for air pollution. Outdoor air pollution driven by fossil fuel emissions kills more than four million people every year, according to the WHO. It increases the risk of respiratory diseases, strokes, heart disease, lung cancer, diabetes and other health problems, posing a threat that has been compared to tobacco. The damage is caused partly by PM2.5 microparticles, which are mostly from fossil fuels. People breathe these tiny particles into their lungs, where they can then enter the bloodstream. While spikes in air pollution, such as extremes seen in India's capital New Delhi earlier this month, trigger respiratory problems and allergies, long-term exposure is believed to be even more harmful. However it is not all bad news. The Lancet Countdown report found that deaths from air pollution due to fossil fuels have fallen 16 percent since 2005, mostly due to efforts to reduce the impact of coal burning. The changing climate means that mosquitoes, birds and mammals will roam beyond their previous habitats, raising the threat that they could spread infectious diseases with them. Mosquito-borne diseases that pose a greater risk of spreading due to climate change include dengue, chikungunya, Zika, West Nile virus and malaria. The transmission potential for dengue alone will increase by 36 percent with 2C warming, the Lancet Countdown report warned. Storms and floods create stagnant water that are breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and also increase the risk of water-borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid and diarrhoea. Scientists also fear that mammals straying into new areas could share diseases with each other, potentially creating new viruses that could then jump over to humans. Worrying about the present and future of our warming planet has also provoked rising anxiety, depression and even post-traumatic stress -- particularly for people already struggling with these disorders, psychologists have warned. In the first 10 months of the year, people searched online for the term ""climate anxiety"" 27 times more than during the same period in 2017, according to data from Google Trends cited by the BBC this week.",-1.0,0.0

<li>My work vividly depicts the effects of the climat… [+5655 chars]",News," Throughout history, art has been a powerful tool for addressing the most pressing issues of the day. Today's social movements are no different: Younger generations are turning to art to create change just like their predecessors. With creativity and expression, young people around the world are making significant strides in raising awareness of society's carbon footprint and driving the climate-action conversation. As anartist and climate activist, I've seen firsthand how art is used to slow the climate crisis. In my work, I craft large-scale art installations, paint murals, and curate exhibits that vividly depict the impacts of the climate emergency. These techniques serve as a bridge from apathy to empathy, triggering emotions and inspiring action. Humanity has been apart from nature for generations, versus a part of nature, which I believe has spurred a macro-emotional disconnection from the earth that underpins the climate crisis. By engaging the public in a tangible way, art can create a sense of urgency, prompt a collective call to action, and motivate a reconnection with the planet. Fashion designers arestarting to embracesustainable and green materials in their work, moving away from harmful chemicals and dyes by weaving sustainability into the production process — from sourcing fabric to manufacturing the garments to extending the life cycle of clothes when they leave the shelves. This shift reduces the environmental footprint of the fashion industry and shows what's possible with alternative products. For example, Pangaia, a clothing and materials-science company, is turning away from harmful polyesters, which contribute to textile waste. The brand makes its sweatsuits out of 20% lyocell SeaCell, or seaweed fiber, and 80% organic cotton. It also uses a biowicking treatment made from microalgae, a dye made from inedible fruit and vegetable waste. Pangaia isjust one example of this work. By championing eco-conscious practices across fashion, design, and elsewhere, artists set an example for our peers and audiences by encouraging wider adoption of sustainable approaches. Art gives us the opportunity to portray nature and the environment in various forms to cultivate a sense of environmental stewardship and build a deeper connection and appreciation for the natural world. For instance, Olafur Eliasson is an artist who creates immersive, ecologically minded experiences that focus on the global environmental crisis and how art can offer solutions. His work, titled ""The Weather Project,"" which debuted at the Tate Modern in London in 2003, depicts the dynamic, all-absorbing nature of the weather. Building cultural narratives such as Eliasson's can create a more environmentally conscious society where individuals are empowered to use their voices for good, in the workplace, in the streets, and beyond. The Western world, which produces many sustainability-related resources, centers the English language, thereby limiting global accessibility to research papers, information delivered in speeches, and other needed data and guidance. Art plays a crucial role in making climate action accessible to all by pushing past language barriers and triggering emotions. Through its universal language, art can convey complex ideas and solutions, allowing people from different backgrounds and cultures to connect to issues surrounding the climate crisis. Graphic design and advertising offer opportunities for art to play a role in combating the climate crisis. Through captivating visuals and innovative messaging, companies and nonprofit organizations can generate awareness of the need for climate action and motivate people to take action on various social-justice issues across media platforms. For example, Pussy Riot, a Russian feminist punk band and activist group, took to Trafalgar Square billboards in London this year with their ""Cultural Institute of Radical Contemporary Arts"" project, a visual project that used graphic design and art to convey the lasting need for gender equity. This kind of visual media can reach an audience and shape perception and behavior among people who may not typically be engaged in civic issues. As an artist, I believe in the transformative potential of art to curb our climate catastrophe. I will continue to use my creativity as a force for positive change, reminding myself and others that a paintbrush can be stronger than any number of words. Through visual storytelling, continuous practice, advocacy, education, and fostering a deeper connection to nature, art stands as a beacon of hope in our collective efforts to combat the climate emergency.

Calculate Now",India,"Daren Tang, DG of World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), a forum which promotes invention and creativity, feels that innovation doesn't just happen in Silicon Valley, but also in New Delhi. Tang, who is half-way in his term, having joined the Geneva-based organisation three years back, plans to make intellectual property more inclusive, diverse and sustainable.In an interview with TOI, he says India can offer much to the developing world in innovation, particularly in climate change-related technologies.Considering you are the first Asian DG and aim to serve the 'underserved', what is your strategy?The vision of this administration with me as the DG is to build a more inclusive IP (intellectual property) ecosystem. One that is not just for IP specialists and experts, but a catalyst for growth and development, especially for developing countries and the Global South. I think it's so important that IP is seen as not just something for advanced industrialised nations, but also can accompany the journey of developing countries. And India is one example of how it's really taken advantage of IP to harness the innovative and creative potential of its people. Consider these three facts: Arijit Singh out-streamed Beyonce last year. Bollywood continues to produce more films than Hollywood. And major streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney are investing record-breaking amounts in Indian content. In all, India's creative economy is now a $30 billion industry and creative exports are up 20% last year, generating over $11 billion. All this is reflected in India's performance in the Global Innovation Index.How do you plan to make the world more inclusive, diverse and more sustainable?As part of building a more inclusive IP ecosystem, our priority at WIPO will be to focus especially on the underserved. First is women. Right now, only 16% of international patents are filed by women. We need to close that gender gap in patent filings globally. Second is youth, because young people, and especially in developing countries need to know and feel that innovation doesn't just happen in Silicon Valley, but also in New Delhi. Third is SMEs and startups because the big companies have the knowledge and the pockets to employ the best consultants and to advise them on IP. SMEs make up 90% of companies in many countries, including India, where you've got 70 million SMEs - so this is the biggest SME country in the world. And yet, many SMEs don't know how to use IP as part of their business journey. So we need to help them. The fourth is indigenous communities. As someone from Singapore, a country which has many immigrants coming from Asian civilisations, I know that the knowledge, heritage and wisdom of our ancestors is a very important part of who we are. And this is true not just in Asia, but also in many other parts of the world. So, we are reaching out to support all these traditionally underserved groups.Do you think that AI will create challenges for policy makers dealing with intellectual property rights?Let me zoom out a bit first. One-third of all patents are now connected to digital technologies. Not just AI, but also quantum computing, IoT, machine learning. So, AI should be seen in this larger context that digital is really transforming the innovation landscape. Hardware is now merging with software, and the line between the two are blurring. India is not just a strong player in software, but also in hardware and deep technology. As the two start to come together, India is very well poised to take advantage of the synergies that arise from when you combine digital with deep tech. Of course, AI presents a particularly disruptive force, not just in IP, but in many, many other areas. A lot of the AI-related issues are difficult issues. So at WIPO, one of things we do is to bring people together to talk about the issues that they face. We want to be the global forum where best practices are discussed.",0.0,0.0

And a good deal of that comes from wind energy — from turbines like those behind him.Amanda Aronczyk/NPRhide caption Ramón Méndez Galain was Uruguay's National Director of Energy from 2008 to 2015. His plan for the energy sector led to 98% of Uruguay's grid being powered by green energy. And a good deal of that comes from wind energy — from turbines like those behind him. Back in 2007, Uruguay had a massive problem with no obvious fix. The economy of this country of 3.5 million people was growing, but there wasn't enough energy to power all that growth. There was energy rationing, and people's power bills kept going up. ""It was difficult for us to cope,"" Ramón Méndez Galain remembers. ""It was difficult to get electricity. For some time, we were beginning to have blackouts."" Méndez Galain had trained as a particle physicist. ""When you are trained as a scientist,"" he says, ""you are trained to see an unsolved problem, and [to try] to find an explanation and a solution. So I used, if you wish, my scientific skills I had developed in order to face this difficulty with the same strategy."" He started researching different potential paths for Uruguay's energy future and reaching out to experts he knew around the world. Ultimately, he wrote up an entire plan for how Uruguay could change its energy mix so that it relied almost entirely on renewable energy. There would be less pollution, it would be better for the climate, and, he thought, in the long run, it would be the most economical choice Uruguay could make. And then one day, Méndez Galain received a phone call in his office. Ramón Méndez Galain in his living room in Montevideo.Amanda Aronczyk/NPRhide caption Ramón Méndez Galain in his living room in Montevideo. ""He said, 'Oh, hi Ramón,"" Méndez Galain recalls. ""I've been reading what you said. I'm talking with the president, and we wanted you to implement that strategy.'"" The president of Uruguay had seen Méndez Galain's plan and was now inviting him to become Uruguay's new national director of energy. Méndez Galain accepted. Countries all over the world have spent the last decade announcing lofty goals to reduce the emissions that cause climate change. In the United States, President Biden has set a goal to reach100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. But Uruguay has almost reached that goal already. In a typical year,98% of Uruguay's grid is powered by green energy. Méndez Galain's plan was built around two simple facts about his country. First, while there wasn't a domestic supply of fossil fuels like coal or oil, there was a great deal of wind. Second, that wind blew over a country that was, to a great extent, composed of uninhabited agricultural land. His vision for Uruguay's energy future was to cover that empty land with hundreds of wind turbines. Today, wind power accounts for around 40% of Uruguay's energy production. And, according to a 2008 law, all the wind in the country officially belongs to the Uruguayan people.Amanda Aronczyk/NPRhide caption Today, wind power accounts for around 40% of Uruguay's energy production. And, according to a 2008 law, all the wind in the country officially belongs to the Uruguayan people. To solve the question of how to pay for all those turbines, Méndez Galain came up with a variation on an approach used by some electric utilities in neighboring Brazil. Those utilities were run via public-private partnerships, in which the utilities handled energy generation, while private companies were in charge of power distribution and customer service. Méndez Galain's scheme involved reversing that relationship, so that private companies would be in charge of setting up and maintaining the wind turbines that would power Uruguay's grid, while the public utility would continue to distribute that energy to its customers His scheme had the built-in advantage of pushing the billions of dollars in upfront cost to construct all those wind turbines onto the private companies. In exchange, the public utility would agree to buy all the energy those turbines produced at a set rate for 20 years. ""Investors need to have the security that their investment will be paid back,"" explains Méndez Galain, ""and for that they need a certain amount of time."" In 2009, Uruguay started holding auctions in which different wind companies from around the world came to bid on how cheaply they'd sell renewable energy to the country. In 2011, Uruguay held an auction intended to secure 150 megawatts of new wind power, which would have represented about 5% of the country's energy generating capacity. After more than 20 different companies threw in their bids, Méndez Galain and his team decided to radically accelerate their timeline for the country's energy transition. They accepted far more bids than they had originally planned, signing contracts that increased Uruguay's capacity to generate electricity not by 5%, but by more than 40%. Within a few years of Méndez Galain receiving that phone call inviting him to become the national director of energy, he had achieved what he had set out to do. Uruguay's energy grid was powered almost exclusively by domestically created, renewable energy, and, adjusted for inflation, consumer prices had gone down. Today, there are more than 700 wind turbines installed across Uruguay's countryside. ""It was absolutely a complete transformation,"" says Méndez Galain. ""So many people talk about what happened as an Uruguayan energy revolution. Because really it was a revolution."" Today's show was hosted by Erika Beras and Amanda Aroncyzk.

Pakistan’s World Cup campaign remained unsuccessful with four wins and three losses. Even as people agree that Azam’s batsmanship is par excellence, his captaincy may not be so. Dawn (November 16)says, “Babar has divided opinion but there remains no doubt that he remains Pakistan’s batting mainstay. There were questions over his decision-making as captain but there are no questions about his class.” News International (November 16) comments on the overall state of Pakistan’s cricket team saying, “For Pakistan cricket to bounce back, it will take much more than a mere resignation of a failed captain… The upside for Pakistan cricket is that, despite all odds, it keeps on finding exciting new talent…players like Babar, who despite his failure as captain, is a major asset for Pakistan cricket.” Express Tribune (November 17)agrees, saying, “Good managers and coaches do have their importance, but what brings sustained change in players’ performance is the work done at the grassroots… Unless we focus on improving the domestic cricket structure, we will never be able to abandon the tag of being unpredictable.” Good news for the economy Pakistan successfully completed the first review of its short-term loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Fund has agreed to release the next installment amounting to $710 million, as part of the $3 billion Standby Arrangement with Pakistan. The Nation (November 17)celebrates this development, saying, “Beyond being a financial lifeline, this endorsement positions Pakistan favourably in the eyes of international investors, emphasising the nation’s unwavering commitment to essential elements such as fiscal consolidation, energy sector reforms, and a market-determined exchange rate — all vital for sustained economic growth.” Express Tribune (November 16),however, warns, “The international lender, which is closely monitoring the trajectory of reforms, has called for transparency and accountability in business deals. This means a perfect institutional mechanism is desired in decision-making, and no more ad hocism as is the case.” Moreover, on the question of the economy’s future, Tribune asks, “will the economy be glued to the Fund in years to come or there is a plan to become self-reliant?” Lahore’s smog problem Lahore is at the top of the global pollution chart with an AQI of 470 during the day. Lahore, likeDelhi, witnesses a massive decline in air quality in the winter due to “vehicle and industrial emissions, smoke from brick kilns, burning of crop residue and general waste, and dust from construction sites” (Dawn, November 15). Earlier this week, the Punjab government imposed an “environmental and health emergency” with schools, malls, parks and other public spaces shut down. Authorities are even considering artificial rain to curb air pollution. The Nation (November 16)comments on the feasibility and accuracy of measures implemented saying, “Lockdown’s decision to keep the citizens safe and let the city breathe had its own complexities. Under economic strain… business and service sectors cannot agree to suspend activity four days a week… human activity that is piling up the hazardous, long-last­ing pollutants in the air, need to be checked.” Dawn (November 16),however, believes, “The government’s response, while well-intentioned, seems to lack a long-term vision. The focus on punitive measures, such as fines and demolitions, and the deployment of teams to monitor industrial units, are necessary steps but they scratch only the surface of a multifaceted problem.” Climate change impact on children On November 14, Unicef released a report titled ‘The climate-changed child’, which found that one billion children are at “extremely high risk” from the climate crisis with 436 million living in areas of “high or extreme water vulnerability”, which includes Pakistan, and largely, South Asia. This is concerning because one-quarter of the world’s children reside in South Asia. News International (November 16)speaks to the reason for this in Pakistan saying, “the expansion of urban areas and a rise in vertical living have increased water demand. And while the governments fail to meet people’s needs, they have allowed private water companies to exploit the country’s resources and sell the utility at higher rates. The editorial points out the disparities in living standards that contribute to the abysmal number of children being deprived saying, “On the one hand, densely populated low-income areas have to store water in jerry cans and drums as they receive ‘line water’ once or twice a week, and on the other, residential buildings in posh areas maintain large swimming pools that require an extensive amount of water.” Dawn (November 15)comments on the larger need to “refocus our climate strategies and policies on children”. It points out that “only 2.4 per cent of climate finance is dedicated to child-focused activities.” Hence, “In addressing climate change, we must not forget to secure our children’s future. Amplifying their voices and needs in the climate conversation is not just an environmental imperative but also a moral one.” adya.goyal@expressindia.com",-1.0,0.0

Upon his arrival, dozens of people waving British flags welcomed him with loud cheers. William, 41, shook hands, signed autographs and sportingly took selfies with many of them during a walkabout.""It's fantastic to be back in Singapore for this year's Earthshot Prize ceremony, after eleven years,"" he said in a statement upon landing. ""Singapore's bold vision to be a leader for environmental innovation sets the standard for others to follow."" At Singapore's Changi Airport and before greeting the crowd, William stood on an upper floor for a stunning view of the 40-meter high Rain Vortex, the world's largest indoor waterfall that was illuminated green to mark his arrival. He was also shown a tree planted in his honor in the indoor garden at the foot of the waterfall. The heir to the British throne last visited Singapore with his wife Princess Catherine in 2012. Traveling solo this time, William's focus is on the Earthshot Prize that he and his Royal Foundation charity launched in 2020 to promote innovative solutions and technologies to combat global warming and mitigate its impact on the environment.  William will name five winners at the award ceremony on Tuesday, who will each get a million pounds ($1.2 million) to help them scale up their projects for wider global reach. Fifteen finalists representing six continents were selected from 1,300 nominees this year. The winners are from five categories: nature protection, clean air, ocean revival, waste elimination and climate change. It will be the first time the award ceremony is held in Asia. The inaugural ceremony was held in London in 2021, followed by Boston last year. The prize's name refers to the late President John F. Kennedy's 1962 ""moonshot"" speech, which challenged Americans to reach the moon by the end of that decade. That inspired the prince and his partners to set a similar goal for finding solutions to pressing environmental problems by 2030. Singapore's Foreign Ministry said William will call on Singapore President Tharman Shanmugaratnam and meet Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loon at The Istana Palace - one of Singapore's oldest heritage sites - during his four-day trip. William, a keen sportsman, will also try his hand at dragon boating, a popular sport in Singapore and many parts of the world. He will also meet Singaporeans to see how local organizations are working to protect and restore the planet.  William's office at Kensington Palace has said that Singapore was chosen to host this year's awards ceremony because of its role as a ""hub for innovation"" in Southeast Asia.  William will also attend the United for Wildlife global summit, featuring representatives of law enforcement agencies, conservation groups and corporations working to combat trade in illegal wildlife products, estimated at $20 billion annually.",1.0,0.0

""As we've seen in other fields, incorporating sex analysis into the environmental sciences can lead to new discoveries about the natural world—both its resilience and its vulnerability in face of the ever increasing climate catastrophe,"" Schiebinger said.For several populations of the black-vented shearwater, a coastal seabird that nests along Baja California, Mexico, a 2014 marine heat wave led to behavioral differences between males and females. A large mass of warm water known as ""The Blob"" upended ocean food webs and prompted male and female shearwaters, which typically forage in the same area, to avoid competition with one another by feeding separately. Males flew north and females flew south.This observation matters for conservation managers in Baja. For example, a marine protected area could unintentionally protect the foraging grounds of only one sex of the near-threatened seabird during warmer years, with cascading impacts on the overall population.""One million species are at risk of extinction due to human impacts, jeopardizing thenatural worldthat makes our life possible and beautiful,"" said global change biologist Elizabeth Hadly, a co-author of the study and professor of biology in the School of Humanities and Sciences. ""By considering biological sex in climate change studies, we can better predict what's to come and better protect marine andterrestrial species.""Varying responsesInpolar regions, where global warming impacts are most extreme, years with earlier snowmelt can be a boon for Arctic wolf spiders. An earlier spring kick-starts the growing season. Given the extra time to mature, both sexes grow larger, with females increasing in size even more than males, improving their odds of getting and staying pregnant and their ability to nourish their offspring. For female caribou, on the other hand, which bulk up in the spring to care for their young, accelerated snow melt forces them to migrate north as springtime warms the pole. Their search for greening vegetation is often rewarded by nutritious food, but the journey exposes them to predators like wolves that roam the higher latitudes.In the Southern Hemisphere, hotter sands in Australia threaten the survival of six sea turtle species that nest on the beaches. The environment determines a sea turtle's sex. For the loggerhead species, if the sand incubates the eggs at around 29°C (84°F), hatchlings will be female. Below that temperature, males hatch.""In order for sea turtle populations to survive into the future, they need to have an appropriate ratio of males to females,"" said co-author Larry Crowder, a marine ecologist and professor of oceans. ""If we overlook the different vulnerabilities of each sex to rising global temperatures, we risk losing thirty years of conservation efforts within one generation ofsea turtles.""Incorporating biological sexIn many cases, researchers don't gather sex-specific data simply because it's logistically difficult, said Gissi. Among some bird species like blue jays and mourning doves, males and females can be difficult to distinguish by appearance alone. Other researchers may lack awareness that these data are relevant for study results or policy outcomes, she said.But change is afoot. In an effort to produce more male hatchlings, the Queensland Government's sea turtle conservation strategy, published in 2021, prioritized tactics like shading nests and relocating eggs to cooler locations. Gissi also pointed to steps being taken by funding agencies and scientific journals. In 2022, the National Science Foundation hosted workshops on how best to integrate sex analysis into their funding guidelines, the same year that the journalNatureannounced guidelines that require authors to state how they included or excluded sex in their study design, and to clarify why.""Potentially, biological sex has something to do with every experiment involving living organisms,"" said Gissi. ""Including sex analysis in research design should become the default. To enhance the rigor and reproducibility of science, it's valuable to report when sex plays an important role and also to report null results, when sex is not a determining factor. If we want to safeguard the future of life on Earth, we need to assess what role sex plays in our rapidly changing world.""Taking action to reverse biodiversity lossScientists, funding agencies, and policymakers, particularly those working in conservation, can all play a role in enabling sex-specific science when considering how species respond to climate change. The study authors recommend the following:For scientists:Study the relative contribution of sex and climate drivers in organisms' response to climate changeExamine how sex-specific responses to climate change at an individual level will affect species populations and communitiesIncorporate analysis ofbiological sexinto lab and field experimentsFor funding agencies:Support basic research on sex-specific responses to climate changeFor policymakers:Consider sex-specific responses of species to climate stressors before designating new protected areas, and coordinate management and monitoring based on sex-specific knowledge for climate adaptation and mitigation",0.0,0.0

Last month also had the warmest October day for 97 years. Armagh Observatory, one of dozens of weather stations around Northern Ireland has recorded daily rainfall at its meteorological station since 1838. It recorded a total of 195.4mm rainfall in October, exceeding the 193.8mm observed 153 years ago. County Armagh was affected by severe flooding in some areas at the end of October and start of November. The Met Office has also said county Down had its wettest October ever. As well as being the warmest October day for almost a century, the temperature of 21.7C is the third highest October temperature ever recorded at the observatory. Its director Prof Michael Burton said the data sent a clear signal. ""There's no doubt in the pattern we're all seeing - these are all evidence of the world's changing climate,"" he said. ""Essentially the extreme will become more often and so you get more hot days, more wet days, you even get cold days as well. ""But it's the extreme - it's no longer an oddity, it's a regular event that these things are happening and they're happening everywhere."" It comes as communities in counties Down, Armagh and Antrim start to assess the damage after flooding this week. While Professor Burton said no single measurement should have too much read into it, he explained that a warmer atmosphere does hold more water and that means we are likely to experience more warmer, wetter winters. ""That's physics,"" he added. When it comes to discerning climate change in action, the more evidence you can gather, the better. And more than 200 years' worth of consistent records make for a lot of evidence. It allows patterns and changes to be clearly detected. The records at Armagh Observatory show definitively that climate change is affecting our lives here and now. As well as more rainfall as the result of a warming atmosphere, the increasing temperature can also be seen in the data and these all present challenges for us to adapt to. But they are also a signal that time to mitigate the impact of climate change is running out.",0.0,0.0

But its agribusiness industry also faces criticism, especially over destruction of the Amazon rainforest.Here is an overview of the South American ag giant, which, more than a decade after passing the United States as the world's biggest soy and beef exporter, is set to overtake US corn exports this year and is now eying the cotton crown.Big and growingBrazil's agriculture ministry triumphantly announced recently the sector's output will hit a record 1.15 trillion reais ($230 billion) this year.The country—the world's fifth-largest by surface area—is the top producer and exporter of sugar, coffee and soy.It is also the world's top supplier of chicken and beef, and second in cotton, after the United States.Agribusiness accounts for nearly one-fourth of Brazil's economy, and half its exports in the first half of the year.Roots of the boomBrazil's emergence as an agricultural giant goes back to Portuguese colonial times. Fortunes were made here on a succession of commodities: sugarcane, then cotton, rubber and finally coffee, which reigned supreme for more than a century.But the turning point came in the 1960s and 70s, when Brazil's then military regime ushered in the so-called ""green revolution"" and encouraged the expansion of agriculture to the Amazon and Cerrado savanna.Fueled by Chinese demand, Brazil would go on to become the dominant producer of soy, a widely used ingredient in animal feed worldwide.""Research on genetic improvements, techniques to correct soil acidity and fertilizers""—plus pesticide development—have allowed Brazil to expand soy, corn andcotton productionintotropical regions, state agricultural research company Embrapa told AFP.Brazil is able to harvest two and sometimes three crops a year, thanks to its climate and the development of zero till planting and genetically modified (GMO) crops—which today account for 80 to 90 percent of the country's soy, corn and cotton output.Production of all three has tripled in the past two decades.Price of successBut the boom has come with controversy.The agribusiness industry has helped fuel deforestation in the Amazon, which President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has vowed to halt.Polemics over high rates of deforestation, pesticides and GMO use have hurt Brazil's brand in some places, including the European Union, which has held off ratifying a free-trade deal with South American bloc Mercosur over environmental issues.The agro sector's image has also paid a price internationally for its close association with controversial far-right ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, who was in office from 2019 to 2022.Under pressureLula will have to come to terms with the powerful agribusiness lobby if he wants to keep his promise to stop Amazon deforestation by 2030, after a surge in destruction under Bolsonaro.The veteran leftist, who needs the sector's help to keep the economy growing, is looking to open new markets for Brazilian producers via trade deals, notably with top buyer China.For its part, the ag sector is keen to polish its image, with international clients increasingly demanding deforestation-free products.""Meat companies are working particularly hard to make their supply chains traceable, which is fundamental for export value,"" said Luiz Carlos Correa Carvalho, president of the Brazilian Agribusiness Association.Grain producers meanwhile tout the recent adoption of a sustainable farming deal aimed at protecting the Cerrado.Environmentalists say that is not enough.""Real progress would be zero deforestation,"" said Cristiane Mazzetti of Greenpeace Brazil, who called for new production models that protect biodiversity.The issue is urgent, especially since climate change is already starting to hit agricultural output.""We have to evolve toward a more sustainable model,"" said Britaldo Soares Filho, a researcher on environmental modeling at the University of Minas Gerais.""When agribusiness harms the environment, it's shooting itself in the foot.""",-1.0,0.0

The rainforest in the eastern part of South America is one of the most threatened tropical forest areas and is home to more than 50% of the amphibian species found in Brazil.In their study, published in the journalPerspectives in Ecology and Conservation, the scientists show that even a moderateclimate changetrend will have an enormous impact on the future diversity of amphibians—and that economic interests are putting frogs and their ilk under additional pressure.The effects ofclimatechange are being felt on a global scale: Forest fires, dried-up water bodies, or extreme weather events are the order of the day. ""In our recent study, we investigated how climate change will affect the amphibians of the Mata Atlântica, one of the most threatened tropical forest areas in the world,"" explains PD Dr. Raffael Ernst of the Senckenberg Natural History Collections Dresden.""Amphibians are highly dependent on specific microclimatic parameters and occupy very different ecological niches. Thus, they are ideal model organisms to study the effects of anthropogenic climate change on biodiversity.""The Atlantic rainforest of Brazil is facing heavy pressure, which has led to unprecedented deforestation and degradation in recent decades. Originally, the Mata Atlântica covered an area of about 150 million hectares, extending from southern to northeastern Brazil. In addition to dense forests, the area also contains open areas such as clearings, fields, swamps, and ponds.""Currently, only 12% to 16% of the original ecosystem remains, and what is left is heavily fragmented. Yet, this habitat hosts nearly 20% of all known South Americanamphibian speciesand more than 50% of those found in Brazil,"" explains Dr. Paula Ribeiro Anunciação, lead author of the study from the Federal University of Lavras.Ribeiro Anunciação joined Ernst and other researchers in a two-year research fellowship to look at the future of amphibians, birds, anddung beetles—ecologically important indicator groups—in the study area. For amphibians, the team examined two scenarios concerning their development through the years 2050 and 2070, respectively: the scenario RCP 4.5 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects moderate climate change, while RCP 8.5 is based on largely uncontrolled warming.""For both scenarios and time periods, we predict a significant decline in taxonomic and functional amphibian diversity in the future—that is, we will not only lose individual species irretrievably, but the entire ecosystem will change,"" says Ernst. According to the modeling results, this will affect species that thrive in closed forests as well as animals that prefer open habitats.Only in the eastern coastal region and in high-altitude habitats is it likely that the original diversity of frogs and other animals will be largely preserved despite climate change. ""However, it is precisely these areas—due to their proximity to Brazil's most developed urban and industrial locations—that are at the center of current real estate speculation,"" warns the herpetologist from Dresden.""Therefore, it is not enough to identify such biodiversity refuges and then hope that they will contribute to the long-term preservation of biological diversity in times of global climate change. Rather, it is important to sustainably and effectively combat the underlying cause—i.e., climate change. This is the only way we can also preserve the unique ecosystem and theamphibiandiversity of the Mata Atlântica.""",-1.0,0.0

This led many detractors of the self-styled ""anarcho-capitalist"" to call his candidacy a ""leap into the void"". Now, with the mop-haired president-elect only two weeks away from taking over Latin America's third-largest economy, many are asking, how will his policies and positions face the test of reality? Javier Milei had proposed to dollarise the economy and eliminate the Argentine Central Bank as a strategy to ""kill"" hyper-inflation. This meant making the US dollar the national currency in place of the Argentine peso, whose value, Mr Milei said, had been ""melting like blocks of ice in the Sahara"".  One obstacle is that ditching the Central Bank and making the US dollar legal tender would need approval from Argentina's Congress and could even require changing the constitution. Although Mr Milei convincingly won the presidency, his Libertad Avanza (Freedom Advances) movement is barely the third largest political force in Congress. This suggests difficult negotiations might be in store. Some economists have also questioned whether Mr Milei's plans are feasible, saying they would weaken his government's ability to manage domestic monetary policy. Having the US dollar as the Argentine currency would effectively leave interest rate policy in the hands of the US Federal Reserve. Argentina's economy would be more vulnerable to external shocks involving the US dollar, for example sudden rises in prices for oil and fuel imports, which could make internal adjustments even more painful inside the country.  Sceptics also point out that Argentina would need to have in hand the US dollars to replace the pesos. Experts believe this could require anywhere between US $35bn to $50bn which indebted Argentina currently does not have and may not be able to borrow easily. Mr Milei himself has admitted his ""shock adjustment"" economic stabilisation recipe could actually take up to two years to bring down inflation. ""Saying anything else is lying,"" he said. Another topic that had made media headlines was Mr Milei's apparent declaration of himself as a climate change ""sceptic"", that is, someone who denies the role of humans in global warming. ""I do not deny climate change. What I am saying is that there is a temperature cycle in the history of the Earth... Therefore, all those policies that blame humans for climate change are false,"" Mr Milei said during a presidential debate last month, causing much commentary and criticism. In his proposed government programme, one of the numerous ministries he had said he planned to axe would be the existing environment ministry.  Such apparent climate scepticism risked putting Mr Milei sharply out of tune with an international majority of governments and leaders who plan to gather at the COP28 climate conference in Dubai soon to seek urgent solutions to the problems of climate change and global warming. Before he was elected, Mr Milei virulently attacked Argentine Pope Francis, calling him a ""Jesuit who promotes communism"", and even the ""representative of the evil one [the Devil] on Earth"".  Such statements caused frictions with the local Catholic Church and the Vatican.  However, this antagonism appeared to miraculously dissipate only days after his election win, when Mr Milei had what he called a ""very friendly"" phone call with the Pope, whom he addressed as ""Your Holiness"", inviting him to visit Argentina in 2024. Asked in a TV interview about this change of heart, Mr Milei conceded that, when one is president, ""there are some things that require greater doses of pragmatism"". Before his election, Milei had signalled he could freeze ties with Brazil and China, Argentina's two top trading partners, on the grounds that he did ""not make pacts with communists"".  ""I am going to be aligned with the United States, Israel, and the free world,"" he said.  Not surprisingly, this assertion caused consternation in Beijing and Brasilia, as well as in Argentina. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson was quoted as warning that it would be a ""huge foreign policy mistake"" for Argentina to cut ties with countries such as China and Brazil.  Mr Milei's predecessor, outgoing left-wing President Alberto Fernández, had carefully nurtured ties with Beijing and had welcomed an invitation to join Brics, the China-led group which also comprises Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa. Experts questioned the wisdom of dismantling a relationship that clearly brought benefits to Argentina, and not only by China being a top market for Argentina's soybean, meat and grains. China was also helping to prop up Argentina's financial reserves with a major currency swap deal - significant support for a country already heavily indebted to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Days after the election, however, there seemed to be clear signs that no major break in relations was planned. The president-elect received a personal letter of ""congratulations and good wishes"" from Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mr Milei himself made a point of thanking Xi on social media. Mr Milei's pick for foreign minister, Diana Mondino, also dismissed as ""nonsense"" any suggestion that there would be a rupture in ""commercial relations"" with China or Brazil. In Brazil, Mr Milei's invitation for former President Jair Bolsonaro to attend his 10 December inauguration was interpreted as ""unfriendly"" towards Brazil's current left-wing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.  But Milei has since said Lula would be ""well-received"", if he wanted to come. Mr Milei and his vice-presidential running-mate Victoria Villarruel also ignited intense controversy during the campaign with their position regarding Argentina's 1976-83 military dictatorship. Defying traditional positions held by Argentina's government and society for the last 40 years, Mr Milei caused outrage by contesting the generally accepted estimate of those abducted and ""disappeared"" in the dictatorship - 30,000 - asserting the actual number was closer to 9,000. The candidate argued that the political violence of the 1970s in Argentina was a two-sided ""war"" in which ""the forces of the state committed excesses but the terrorists [anti-government guerrillas] ... [also] committed crimes against humanity"". This equivalence of presentation of the two sides raised howls of protest from groups like the Plaza de Mayo mothers and grandmothers of disappeared persons. This was just another striking way in which the Milei-Villarruel duo were trying to shake up the political status quo in Argentina. The next four years will show if they can do it.",0.0,0.0

Aotearoa New Zealand is a biodiversity hotspot for deepwater coral—approximately one sixth of the known deep-water coral species of the world have been recorded in our waters.Deep-water corals are under threat due to ocean warming and acidification due to climate change as well as from the physical impacts of bottom trawling. Deep-water corals are ecologically important because they provide critical benthic structure for other species. Fish live inside their reefs and some of these reefs can extend large distances, covering hundreds of square kilometers. These reefs are also significant sites of carbon and nitrogen mineralization.New researchfrom Sustainable Seas National Science Challenge, published inJournal of Environmental Management, looks atmarine conservationfor deep-water corals to assess the impact of bottom trawling oncoralhabitats now and the effectiveness for protecting these habitats in the future. The findings show that bottom trawling impacts all coral taxa, but particularly reef-forming corals. Habitats will also decline in the future due to a changing climate.""When designing protection for these coral with the usual approach, our study found that spatial marine protection is unlikely to provide enough conservation for deep-water corals in the future, due to shifts associated with climate change and fishing,"" says lead researcher Fabrice Stephenson.The research identifies new areas for spatial marine protection that can provide protection for corals against a changing climate while still giving refuge to current populations. This is particularly important given the predicted reduction in coral habitat due to the cumulative effects ofclimate changeand bottom trawling.""Our results demonstrate the considerable risks associated with developing effective marine protected areas that do not account for combining current and future stressors,"" says Fabrice. ""While deep-water corals in New Zealand illustrate this, the same approach is equally applicable to othermarine speciesand for other locations.""It takes decades, if not centuries, for some species of deep-water coral to recover.",1.0,0.0

[+] kilometres northeast of the capital Kampala is seen checking on his solar panels that he uses for home purposes on December 12, 2016.  Residents of the town, surrounded by thatched huts, rivers and grasslands, hope a new solar plant, which went into operation last week, will bring an end to their electricity woes. A USD 19 million (18-million euro), 33-acre solar plant — the first of its kind in East Africa — can produce 10 megawatts of power that is fed into Uganda's national power grid. The project is crucial as Uganda seeks new ways to bring electricity to the 80 percent of its 40 million-strong population that does not have access to power.  / AFP PHOTO / ISAAC KASAMANI        (Photo credit should read ISAAC KASAMANI/AFP via Getty Images) According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), empowering cities to take climate action is essential to achieving ambitious net-zero emissions goals. The World Bank reported that although cities generate over 80% of global GDP, they consume over two-thirds of the world’s energy and account for over 70% of global CO2 emissions. With projections indicating that by 2050, over 70% of the world’s population will reside in urban areas, the demand for sustainable urban energy infrastructure is poised to surge, which means energy systems that enable cities to grow sustainably in a net-zero future are needed. The IEA report emphasizes the importance of digitalization and climatetech solutions for establishing resilient and sustainable urban energy systems, as they can accelerate the energy transition and facilitate smarter, more informed decision-making to meet cities’ energy needs. However, achieving a high level of digitalization and integration of new technologies that significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in cities will require strategic planning, execution, and alignment across all levels of government, as well as adequate funding and infrastructure to address capital shortfalls, lengthy project timelines, and cost overruns. According to Deloitte, cities must focus on identifying viable business projects and leveraging innovative financing strategies to attract private capital and partners that advance sustainable urban energy systems within their regions. In a series of interviews, leading experts shed light on how well-designed policies and coordinated infrastructure development can bring new climatetech solutions to the market and attract private capital for developing and deploying sustainable projects more efficiently in cities worldwide. The World Resource Institution emphasizes electrification to reduce CO2 emissions in cities, focusing on two key areas: the transition to electric transport and the adoption of heat pumps, which can significantly reduce buildings’ GHG emissions. However, to fully harness the decarbonization benefits of electrification, it is essential to shift electric generation to low-carbon sources, such as renewables, and expand capacity and flexibility to accommodate cities’ increasing demands for electricity (Figure 1). Three Steps to Zero-Carbon Cities Recognizing the need to decarbonize cities, governments have started implementing targeted policies and programs to electrify the transport and building sectors, as well as encourage consumers and businesses to become sustainable through new policies. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill have put forward various incentives to promote decarbonization and electrify city buildings and transport in the United States. Meanwhile, in the European Union, 112 cities have been selected to participate in the EU mission for 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030, where these cities will receive funding for projects and assistance from the EU mission platform. Laura Fox, Co-Founder and Managing Partner Laura Fox, co-founder and managing partner at Streetlife Ventures, said, “Globally, governments are using a combination of sticks and carrots to promote electrification in cities. Whether through incentive-driven strategies like those in the United States or implementing carbon pricing solutions like in Europe, these multifaceted approaches are helping bring new climatetech solutions and creative approaches into the market that can enable cities to reduce their carbon footprints.” For example, in Ithaca, a small city in upstate New York, the City Council adopted the Efficiency Retrofitting and Thermal Load Electrification Program to transition homes' energy sources from fossil fuels to electric technologies and decarbonize all of its buildings by 2030. To finance this program, Ithaca has been working with Alturus, a private equity firm and BlocPower, an energy efficiency company, to bring in investors and pay the upfront costs of the buildings project, securing $100M in 2021. Meanwhile, in London, UK, an Ultra-Low Emission Zone (U.L.E.Z.), which charges $135/day to enter, has led 73.5% of Londoners to change their modes of transportation and create new opportunities for micro-mobility and electric minibuses. For cities to best leverage these emerging technologies and the benefits from digitalization to electrify their buildings and transport sectors, Fox said, “Cities, investors and startups will need to work more closely, especially when capital is tight, and new solutions are in demand. For instance, post-pandemic, New York City’s NYCEDC
EDC
 and the city’s ‘New New York’ program have brought together climatetech startups, regulators and investors to advance new solutions, combined with dedicated hubs such as Governors Island and the Brooklyn Navy Yard to create an ecosystem for urban climate solutions.” In addition, as cities worldwide adopt measures to reduce their GHG emissions, Fox highlights, “the ‘M.O.R.E.’ framework (a term she coined in 2022) can be a valuable concept because it helps key stakeholders focus on the different layers required to execute their GHG reduction strategies—particularly in the urban mobility space—and factor in the city’s unique needs.” According to the United Nations, the world’s population growth has become increasingly concentrated in developing countries, with the share of people living in developing countries increasing from 66% in 1950 to 83% now and projected to reach 86% by 2050. The OECD has noted that the path toward net-zero emissions by 2050 will require emerging markets to transform their energy systems, as they are amongst the worst affected by climate change and have the most to gain from collective climate ambition. C40’s analysis has shown a greater proportion of petroleum fuel usage in the Global South vs. North (Figure 2), with the Rocky Mountain Institute advocating for full-scale deployment of commercially proven clean energy technologies to meet growing demand and replace uneconomical fossil fuel generation. Energy Use in the Global South and North Nancy Pfund, Founder and Managing Partner Given the importance of rapidly transitioning the energy system across the Global South, Nancy Pfund, founder and managing partner at DBL Partners, said, “Cities in these regions are fast growing and critical to mitigating the impacts of climate change. As much of the energy infrastructure is yet to be built, we need to bring cost-effective renewable and reliable sources of electricity to prevent new installations of fossil fuel infrastructure and the associated carbon emissions that are locked into place for decades.” With many cities in the Global South facing significant grid stability and reliability challenges, the World Bank notes that distributed energy resources (DERs), such as mini-grids that use renewable energy and combine storage technology, are crucial for driving inclusive growth and decarbonizing the economy. For these reasons, Pfund said, “As large-scale decarbonization efforts are closely connected with a clean and reliant grid, cities and towns that incorporate DERs to enable the installation of reliable, renewable charging and storage infrastructure will stand to benefit—not only in terms of reducing their GHG emissions but also enabling broader sustainable economic development goals.” For example, Pfund noted that in Haiti and South Africa, Zola Electric rolled out its end-to-end grid management solution called “Vision” to partner with Haiti Green Solutions, a local solar developer, and Digicel, a telecommunication company, to provide more reliable and cost-effective electricity access in regions where blackouts are common and manage demand spikes, which can overload the grid. To fully scale these DER solutions that use software and monitoring solutions to manage energy demand with supply, Pfund underscores, “More investment is needed, and, over time, better digital connectivity in emerging markets will facilitate the financing of new infrastructure that can enable these projects to deliver a return.” Since DERs, like mini-grids, are best suited to servicing mid-density communities (Figure 3), USAID notes that integrating the national grid with DERs can provide more cost-effective power to a larger base of consumers. Mini-grid space is optimal for mid-density However, financing the updates and integration of privately owned mini-grids to the central/national grid requires additional capital and the development of substations (including transformers). As a result, Pfund recommends that “countries adopt policy clarity and ownership rights for integrating DERs with the national grid. In countries like Nigeria that have adopted such measures, electrification is taking place more quickly and enabling communities to access clean electricity in the process.” According to the Royal Bank of Canada, high-tech and smart city solutions can enable urban sustainability and foster growth in cities as environmental pressures and infrastructure needs mount. However, despite the potential of these solutions, Marsh Mclennan’s report noted that, of the cities with a smart city roadmap, only 16% have mature projects running, and 30% of current smart city projects will likely be discontinued by 2023. Aside from constructing sustainable projects, managing and building trust among residents remains a constant challenge. For example, the New York Subway’s farebox revenue has fallen 37% from pre-pandemic levels due to a fall in ridership and service bottlenecks. Meanwhile, projects like Sidewalk Labs have faced hurdles in rolling out the full project due to data privacy issues. Michael Tremblay, President and CEO As a result, Michael Tremblay, President and CEO at Invest Ottawa, said, “A multifaceted approach is often required to build, manage and scale sustainable smart city projects that meet growing demand and capitalize on global market opportunity. To address these challenges, mutually beneficial collaboration among regulators, corporations, academia, and technology developers is essential. This is particularly important to manage the complexity, cost, and risk of visionary initiatives with the potential to achieve long-term economic, social, and environmental benefits.” AreaXO Winter Testing 2021 Sonya Shorey, VP of Strategy For example, Invest Ottawa-led AreaX.O has been evaluating autonomous electric vehicle (A-VE) safety at road intersections and battery consumption. To demonstrate the project’s findings, Sonya Shorey, VP of strategy at Invest Ottawa, said, “Area X.O partnered with the University of Warwick to share their data and enable project stakeholders, which includes regulators, technology developers, and corporates, to access the Safety Pool™ Initiative, a global database of Automated Driving System (ADS) data to evaluate the outcomes against those from similar global tests, and bring more transparency into decision making.” Through this collaborative approach, Shorey adds, “Project partners such as Transport Canada and other regulatory bodies are better equipped to shape policies and regulatory frameworks to facilitate the safe adoption of these new technologies and devise a roadmap to bring these new solutions to the market, like Ottawa’s low-speed automated shuttle (LSAS) trials on public roads.” To address data security challenges that are often critical to deploying connected solutions like A-VE charging and route planning, Tremblay recommends “starting the development in private gated innovation sites that enable safe and secure experimentation and risk management. At AreaX.O, we have several smart mobility projects leveraging advanced communications systems that are iterated, tested and validated by government regulators and BlackBerry QNX, a V2X data and cybersecurity partner who is part of the end-to-end process.” By adopting a phased approach that enables the project development in private gated sites followed by carefully managed introduction into public spaces with the community, Tremblay said, “Cities will be better positioned to implement smart city solutions that reduce GHG emissions, gain trust from residents and deliver long-term economic and social benefit.”",1.0,0.0
