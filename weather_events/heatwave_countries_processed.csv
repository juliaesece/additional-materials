Ocean eddies are enormous. They're usually hundreds of kilometers across (100–300km), up to 2km deep and can be visible from space.It turns out these eddies drive change underwater by spawning marine heat waves. Ournew research, published inCommunications Earth & Environment, demonstrates the link between a warm ocean eddy and a record-breaking marine heat wave which struck off Sydney from December 2021 to February 2022.Now it's happening again. An even bigger eddy is forming about 50km off Sydney. We have just returned from a 24-day research voyage on CSIRO's research vesselRV Investigatorto explore this monster eddy.Our estimates suggest this 400km wide beast holds 30% more heat than normal for this part of the ocean. Its currents are spinning at 8km per hour. And the temperatures deep underwater are up to 3°C above normal. If it moves close to shore, it could trigger another coastal marine heat wave.How can an eddy current make a heat wave?Eddies are the ocean equivalent of storms in the atmosphere. Likeweather patterns, they can be warm or cold. But ocean eddies can shape the ocean's patterns of life.Warm eddies are like ocean deserts with little life, while cold eddies are typically much more productive. That's because they draw up nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous from the deep sea, which become food for plankton.Just as storms can in the atmosphere, ocean eddies can drive extreme ""ocean weather."" That's because warm eddies can bring in masses of warm water and keep it there for months. Sea life is often very finely attuned to temperature, so a sudden heat wave like this can heavily impact ecosystems.It's important to better understand how eddy currents grow, move and decay better. That's because they can store large amounts of heat and can temporarily increase coastal sea levels.What we do know is that warm eddies along Australia's east coast can be fed by the East Australian Current when it becomes unstable. The current wobbles back and forth until eventually the wobbles form a coherent circle—an eddy—or adding to an existing one. It's like a garden hose thrashing around on the grass when the flow is too great. These unstable currents can be small, on the kilometer scale, or huge.Our research pinpointed the root cause of the 2021 marine heat wave off Sydney. A large warm eddy formed. But it couldn't spiral away intodeeper waters, because there were cold eddies to the north and south preventing it. That's very similar to what can happen in the atmosphere, where a high pressure system can be held in place by other weather systems.Now, it looks as if history is repeating.Over the past month, an enormous eddy—fully 400km wide and 3km deep—has been spinning up just off southeastern Australia. It's being fed by the warm East Australian Current, which bringswarm waterfrom the tropics down to more temperate waters. This eddy is bigger and warmer than most eddies in the region, especially at this time of year. It has been growing over the past month, and is pushing up against cold waters to the south. Where the two systems meet there are very strong temperature differences—up to 5°C over just 4km.You can get some insight into howeddy currents behave from satellites.Our trip on the research vessel RV Investigator made it possible for us to grasp how this powerful current was behaving—in three dimensions.We also released drifters, GPS-tracked buoys which float around the eddy center in a massive circle. Some have been carried more than 2,000km in the last month, passing where they originally started. Others have escaped the eddy and headed east into the Pacific.These sensors and instruments have given us vital information. Now we know the water in the eddy is flowing at a fast walking pace, around 8km per hour. And we know that while the currents within the eddy are rotating quickly, the eddy itself has remained fairly stationary off the NSW coast, growing with warm waters from further north.We also deployed five divingArgo floats. Satellite data shows ussurface temperaturesin the eddy have hit 23°C, 2° above average for a month. But Argo floats show us the temperatures are even more extreme 500m below the surface, more than 3°C above average.What happens to eddies? Like atmospheric systems, these are effectively heat engines. They transport heat to new areas as they whirl in the ocean. While they hold heat a long time, eventually it's lost to the atmosphere and through mixing at the edges of the current. Eventually, they disappear.But as we head into summer, the mega eddy is unlikely to go anywhere. If it moves towards the coast, where marine life is concentrated, we will see water temperatures spike—and possibly, underwater disaster for many species.We would like to thank the RV Investigator's Master, Captain Andrew Roebuck, Deck Officers and crew and the CSIRO technical staff.","['australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia']",gb,False,False

Research has shown that heat waves have become longer, hotter and more frequent over the last half a century because of human-induced climate change.The 2021 Pacific Northwestheatdome, the Central Plains' summer from hell the following year and this year's Southwest sizzler are the most familiar recent examples in this country. But extreme heat has touched every continent over the last few years: Temperatures have regularly exceeded 122° (50° Celsius) across the Asian subcontinent, and London's thermometers reached 104° (40°C) for the first time last year, much earlier than climate models predicted.But will such extended periods of heat and humidity come to regularly test the limits of human tolerance in places where much of the world's population lives? It could happen sooner than we think.We can study this question using the wet-bulb temperature, which combines the influence of heat and humidity on the human body. It denotes the temperature to which a parcel of air would cool by evaporating water into the environment, analogous to the cooling effect of sweat evaporating from skin.Scientists previously theorized that a wet-bulb temperature of 95°—equivalent to an air temperature of 95 at 100% relative humidity—was the highest at which humans could cool themselves without the aid of fans or air conditioning. But lab testing of young, healthy, non-heat-acclimated people at Pennsylvania State University indicated that the wet-bulb limit was closer to 88.Unfortunately, the hot spots for exceeding this wet-bulb temperature threshold include some of the most populous parts of the world: the Indus River Valley in India and Pakistan, eastern Asia, the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. These regions comprise many low- tomiddle-income countrieswith vulnerable populations that will bear the brunt of climate change even though they contributed relatively little to its causes.Ifglobal warming, currently at 1.2°C (2.2°F) above the preindustrial baseline, is kept to 1.5°C (2.7°F), the extent and duration of temperatures exceeding the threshold can be limited. At 3°C (5.4°F) of warming, however, the duration of exposure in the world's hot spots begins to increase exponentially, and physiologically intolerable conditions also begin to appear in the Americas.Breaking the wet-bulb temperature threshold once, it's worth noting, does not inherently make a place ""too hot for humans."" Chicago, for example, would experience an average of one hour a year above the threshold at 2° of warming, but one has to be exposed to these conditions for six continuous hours without taking precautions to reach dangerous core temperatures.On the other hand, at the same 2° of warming, the city of Hudaydah, Yemen, with a population of about 700,000, will experience an average of 340 hours a year of physiologically intolerable heat and humidity, putting the entire population at increased risk of dying. Divided into six-hour increments, that's equivalent to 56 days a year of these extreme conditions.Other populous globalhot spotsat 2° of warming would include Aden, Yemen, with about 34 days a year of such conditions; Dammam and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with 37 and eight days, respectively; Bandar Abbas and Ahvaz, Iran, with 29 and three; Lahore, Pakistan, with 24; Dubai, with 20; and Delhi and Kolkata, India, with six and five.Even in our current climate, extreme heat is already associated with dire health consequences. A Midwestern heat wave killed 700 people in Chicago in 1995. More than 70,000 died in Europe in the summer of 2003, and in 2010, 55,000 perished due to heat in Russia. More recently, an estimated 1,400 died across Oregon, Washington and British Columbia during the 2021 heat dome, and about 60,000 lost their lives due to extreme heat across Western Europe last year.Thousands more have probably lost their lives in theheat wavesthat have afflicted the Global South, where the lack of public health capacity and reporting obscures the toll. Vulnerable populations die not only of heatstroke but also of complications related to cardiovascular, respiratory and renal illnesses.The results of our study suggest that we need to prepare for, adapt to and mitigate extreme heat right now.How do we put the brakes on the worst consequences of extreme heat? During these ever-worsening summer heat waves, we can prevent heat-related illnesses by opening cooling centers, monitoring vulnerable communities and shifting high-exertion activities to cooler parts of the day. To better prepare for future heat waves, we should also invest in adaptation and mitigation measures to deal with the warming that past emissions have already baked into our future climate.Ultimately, a global effort to reduce the use of fossil fuels and bring net carbon emissions to zero as quickly as possible is the only way to avoid intolerable conditions for billions.Daniel Vecellio is a postdoctoral research scholar at George Mason University's Virginia Climate Center.

Hop yields could decline by as much as 18% by 2050, and their alpha acid content – which makes beer bitter – could decrease by up to 31% due to hotter and drier conditions, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. The findings add toa growing list of thingstheclimate crisis threatensyet people take for granted, said Miroslav Trnka, co-author of the study and researcher at the Global Change Research Institute. “One of the side motives of this study was to illustrate how climate change might be important for even those who think it doesn’t matter,” Trnka told CNN. “We are really seeing changes that are affecting things that we value, like the taste of beer. Climate change really can have an effect on it, or at least have an effect on commodities that are critical for production.” Coffee is in danger. Starbucks is working on solutions Beer brewing has been around since at least 3100 BC, the study notes. Now, each of the basic ingredients of today’s beer — water, barley, yeast and hops – are threatened by global warming. “With climate change affecting a vast number of agricultural crops, I’m not surprised,” said Douglass Miller, a senior lecturer in food and beverage management at Cornell University who is not involved in the study. “Hops are also finicky plants and there might be some crop failures,” Miller said, which could lead brewers to work with different flavor profiles from other types of hops. Researchers used weather data and climate models to analyze how European hops have been and will be affected by climate change between 1970 and 2050, assuming precipitation decreases and temperature increases. Scorching temperatureshave already shifted the start of hop growing season by 13 days from 1970 to 2018, according to the study. The growth of new shoots from the hop plant typically occurs during the spring, but since 1995, the researchers found it’s happening earlier in the regions analyzed than years prior. This early onset triggers earlier harvests, which could make it more difficult for hop growers to schedule harvesting and processing operations. In recent years, more consumers are preferring beer aromas and flavors that require higher-quality hops, according to the study. Since these hops are only grown in smaller regions, researchers say they’re put at even higher risk from climate change-fueled heat waves and droughts. “Hop farmers have changed the locations of hop fields in response to changes in temperature and precipitation and that is likely to continue,” said Mark Sorrells, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Integrative Plant Science who is not involved with the study. Why the climate crisis may be coming for your margarita next And while craft brews with aroma hops may be popular now, consumer preferences could change as growers adapt, Sorrells added. While this study only focused on major hop-growing European countries – which cover nearly 90% of the total area of aromatic hop fields in the continent – Trnka said it’s also representative of what could happen in beer-producing regions in the US such as the Pacific Northwest, where record-shattering heatwaves are occurring more often than usual. “They are facing similar problems like European (countries), perhaps a slightly different timing and different frequency but climate change is cumulatively affecting both regions in very similar ways,” Trnka said. Beer remains one of the world’s most widely consumed beverages. Even in a hotter future, people will still find ways to brew it, Trnka said – but it may not taste the same.","['germany', 'czechrepublic', 'slovenia', 'us']",us,True,False

As climate change pushes temperatures higher around the world, billions of people could be pushed beyond these limits.Since the start of the industrial revolution, when humans began to burn fossil fuels in machines and factories, temperatures around the world have increased by about 1°C, or 1.8° Fahrenheit (F). In 2015, 196 nations signed theParis Agreementwhich aims to limit worldwide temperature increases to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.The researcher team modeled global temperature increases ranging between 1.5°C and 4°C—considered theworst-case scenariowhere warming would begin to accelerate—to identify areas of the planet where warming would lead to heat and humidity levels that exceed human limits.""To understand how complex, real-world problems like climate change will affecthuman health, you need expertise both about the planet and the human body,"" said co-author W. Larry Kenney, professor of physiology and kinesiology, the Marie Underhill Noll Chair in Human Performance at Penn State and co-author of the new study.""I am not a climate scientist, and my collaborators are not physiologists. Collaboration is the only way to understand the complex ways that the environment will affect people's lives and begin to develop solutions to the problems that we all must face together.""A threat to billionsThe ambient wet-bulb temperature limit for young, healthy people is about 31°C, which is equal to 87.8°F at 100% humidity, according to work published in 2022 by Penn State researchers.However, in addition to temperature and humidity, the specific threshold for any individual at a specific moment also depends on their exertion level and other environmental factors, including wind speed and solar radiation. In human history, temperatures and humidity that exceed human limits have been recorded only a limited number of times—and only for a few hours at a time—in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, according to the researchers.Results of the study indicate that ifglobal temperaturesincrease by 2°C above pre-industrial levels, the 2.2 billion residents of Pakistan and India's Indus River Valley, the one billion people living in eastern China and the 800 million residents of sub-Saharan Africa will annually experience many hours of heat that surpass human tolerance.These regions would primarily experience high-humidity heat waves. Heat waves with higher humidity can be more dangerous because the air cannot absorb excess moisture, which limits sweat evaporates from human bodies and moisture from some infrastructure, like evaporative coolers. Troublingly, researchers said, these regions are also in lower-to-middle income nations, so many of the affected people may not have access to air conditioning or any effective way to mitigate the negative health effects of the heat.If warming of the planet continues to 3°C above pre-industrial levels, the researchers concluded, heat and humidity levels that surpass human tolerance would begin to affect the Eastern Seaboard and the middle of the United States—from Florida to New York and from Houston to Chicago. South America and Australia would also experience extreme heat at that level of warming.At current levels of heating, the researchers said, the United States will experience more heat waves, but these heat waves are not predicted to surpass human limits as often as in other regions of the world. Still, the researchers cautioned that these types of models often do not account for the worst, most unusual weather events.""Models like these are good at predicting trends, but they do not predict specific events like the 2021 heat wave in Oregon that killed more than 700 people or London reaching 40°C last summer,"" said lead author Daniel Vecellio, a bioclimatologist who completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Penn State with Kenney.""And remember, heat levels then were all below the limits of human tolerance that we identified. So, even though the United States will escape some of the worst direct effects of this warming, we will see deadly and unbearable heat more often. And—if temperatures continue to rise—we will live in a world where crops are failing and millions or billions of people are trying to migrate because their native regions are uninhabitable.""Understanding human limits and future warmingOver the last several years, Kenney and his collaborators have conducted 462 separate experiments to document the combined levels of heat, humidity and physical exertion that humans can tolerate before their bodies can no longer maintain a stable core temperature.""As people get warmer, they sweat, and more blood is pumped to their skin so that they can maintain their core temperatures by losing heat to the environment,"" Kenney said. ""At certain levels of heat and humidity, these adjustments are no longer sufficient, and body core temperature begins to rise. This is not an immediate threat, but it does require some form of relief. If people do not find a way to cool down within hours, it can lead to heat exhaustion,heat strokeand strain on the cardiovascular system that can lead to heart attacks in vulnerable people.""In 2022, Kenney, Vecellio and their collaborators demonstrated that thelimits of heat and humiditypeople can withstand are lower than were previously theorized.""The data collected by Kenney's team at Penn State provided much needed empirical evidence about thehuman body's ability to tolerate heat. Those studies were the foundation of these new predictions about where climate change will create conditions that humans cannot tolerate for long,"" said co-author Matthew Huber, professor of Earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences at Purdue University.When this work was published, Huber, who had already begun work on mapping the impacts ofclimate change, contacted Vecellio about a potential collaboration. Huber had previously published widely cited work proposing a theoretical limit of humans' heat and humidity limits.The researchers, along with Huber's graduate student, Qinqin Kong, decided to explore how people would be affected in different regions of the world if the planet warmed by between 1.5°C and 4°C. The researchers said that 3°C is the best estimate of how much the planet will warm by 2100 if no action is taken.""Around the world, official strategies for adapting to the weather focus on temperature only,"" Kong said. ""But this research shows that humid heat is going to be a much bigger threat than dry heat. Governments and policymakers need to re-evaluate the effectiveness of heat-mitigation strategies to invest in programs that will address the greatest dangers people will face.""Staying safe in the heatRegardless of how much the planet warms, the researchers said that people should always be concerned about extreme heat and humidity—even when they remain below the identified human limits. In preliminary studies of older populations, Kenney found that older adults experience heat stress and the associated health consequences at lower heat and humidity levels than young people.""Heat is already the weather phenomenon that kills the most people in the United States,"" Vecellio, now a postdoctoral researcher at George Mason University's Virginia Climate Center, said. ""People should care for themselves and their neighbors—especially the elderly and sick—when heat waves hit.""The data used in this study examined the body's core temperatures, but the researchers said that during heat waves, people experience health problems from other causes as well. For example, Kenney said that most of the 739 people who died during Chicago's 1995 heat wave were over 65 and experienced a combination of high bodytemperatureand cardiovascular problems, leading to heart attacks and other cardiovascular causes of death.Looking to the futureTo stop temperatures from increasing, the researchers cite decades of research indicating that humans must reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, especially the carbon dioxide emitted by burning fossil fuels. If changes are not made, middle-income and low-income countries will suffer the most, Vecellio said.As one example, the researchers pointed to Al Hudaydah, Yemen, a port city of more than 700,000 people on the Red Sea. Results of the study indicated that if the planet warms by 4°C, this city can expect more than 300 days when temperatures exceed the limits of human tolerance every year, making it almost uninhabitable.""The worst heat stress will occur in regions that are not wealthy and that are expected to experience rapid population growth in the coming decades,"" Huber said.""This is true despite the fact that these nations generate far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than wealthy nations. As a result, billions of poor people will suffer, and many could die. But wealthy nations will suffer from thisheatas well, and in this interconnected world, everyone can expect to be negatively affected in some way.""","['pakistan', 'india', 'china', 'china', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'australia', 'unitedkingdom', 'yemen', 'yemen']",gb,True,False

On about a third of days in 2023, the average global temperature was at least 1.5C higher than pre-industrial levels. Staying below that marker long-term is widely considered crucial to avoid the most damaging impacts of climate change. But 2023 is ""on track"" to be the hottest year on record, and 2024 could be hotter. ""It is a sign that we're reaching levels we haven't been before,"" says Dr Melissa Lazenby, from the University of Sussex. This latest finding comes after record September temperatures and a summer of extreme weather events across much of the world. When political leaders gathered in Paris in December 2015, they signed an agreement to keep the long-term rise in global temperatures this century ""well below"" 2C and to make every effort to keep it under 1.5C. The agreed limits refer to the difference between global average temperatures now and what they were in the pre-industrial period, between 1850 and 1900 - before the widespread use of fossil fuels. Breaching these Paris thresholds doesn't mean going over them for a day or a week but instead involves going beyond this limit across a 20 or 30-year average. This long-term average warming figure currently sits at around 1.1C to 1.2C. But the more often 1.5C is breached for individual days, the closer the world gets to breaching this mark in the longer term. The first time this happened in the modern era was for a few days in December 2015, when politicians were signing the deal on the 1.5C threshold. Since then the limit has been repeatedly broken, typically only for short periods. In 2016, influenced by a strong El Niño event - a natural climate shift that tends to increase global temperatures - the world saw around 75 days that went above that mark. But BBC analysis of data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service shows that, up to 2 October, around 86 days in 2023 have been over 1.5C warmer than the pre-industrial average. That beats the 2016 record well before the end of the year. There is some uncertainty in the exact number of days that have breached the 1.5C threshold, because the numbers reflect a global average which can come with small data discrepancies. But the margin by which 2023 has already passed 2016 figures gives confidence the record has already been broken. ""The fact that we are reaching this 1.5C anomaly daily, and for a longer number of days, is concerning,"" said Dr Lazenby. One important factor in driving up these temperature anomalies is the onset of El Niño conditions. This was confirmed just a few months ago - although it is still weaker than its 2016 peak. These conditions are helping to pump heat from the eastern Pacific Ocean into the atmosphere. This may explain why 2023 is the first year in which the 1.5C anomaly has been recorded between June and October - when combined with the long-term warming from burning fossil fuels. ""This is the first time we're seeing this in the northern hemisphere summer, which is unusual, it's pretty shocking to see what's been going on,"" said Prof Ed Hawkins, from the University of Reading. ""I know our Australian colleagues are particularly worried about what's going to be the consequences for them with their summer approaching [for instance extreme wildfires], especially with El Niño."" Days when the temperature difference has exceeded 1.5C continued into September, with some more than 1.8C above the pre-industrial average. The month as a whole was 1.75C above the pre-industrial level, and the year to date is around 1.4C above the 1850-1900 average, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service. While 2023 is ""on track"" to become the warmest year on record, it is not expected to breach the 1.5C warming threshold as a global average across the full 12 months. The world's oceans have also been experiencing unusually high temperatures this year and in turn, releasing further heat into the atmosphere. ""The North Atlantic Ocean is the warmest we've ever recorded, and if you look at the North Pacific Ocean, there's a tongue of anomalously warm water stretching all the way from Japan to California,"" said Dr Jennifer Francis from the Woodwell Climate Research Centre in the US. While greenhouse gas emissions are increasing average temperatures, the precise reasons for why these sea temperatures have surged is not fully known. One theory - which is still uncertain - is that a fall in air pollution from shipping across the North Atlantic has reduced the number of small particles and increased warming. Up until now, these ""aerosols"" had been partly offsetting the effect of greenhouse gas emissions by reflecting some of the sun's energy and keeping the Earth's surface cooler than it would have been otherwise. Another perhaps less well-known factor is the situation around Antarctica. There have been ongoing concerns about the state of sea ice around the coldest continent, with data showing the levels far below any previous winter. But according to some experts, two spikes in temperature in recent months in Antarctica - triggered by natural variability - have boosted the global average. However, it's difficult to identify the precise influence of long-term human-caused warming. ""In early July, Antarctica got really warm, they saw record temperatures, which is still 20 or 30 degrees Celsius below zero,"" said Dr Karsten Haustein, from the University of Leipzig. ""And what we see with 1.5C and 1.8C anomalies we are seeing now, it is partially down to Antarctica again."" While the northern hemisphere will naturally cool in autumn and winter, there is a view that the large temperature differences from the pre-industrial period may persist, especially as El Niño reaches a peak at the end of this year or early next. Researchers believe that these ongoing high temperature anomalies should be a wake-up call for political leaders, who will gather in Dubai in November for the COP28 climate summit. Action on emissions is needed, they say, and not just in the long-term. In March, the UN urged countries to accelerate climate action, stressing effective options to reduce emissions were available now, from renewables to electric vehicles. ""It's not just about reaching an end goal, of net zero by 2050, it's about how we get there,"" said Prof Hawkins. ""The IPCC [the UN's climate body] very clearly says we need to halve emissions over this decade, and then get to net zero. It's not just about reaching net zero at some point, it's about the pathway to get there."" And as this year's extreme weather events have shown - from heatwaves in Europe to extreme rainfall in Libya - the consequences of climate change increase with every fraction of a degree of warming.","['france', 'france', 'france', 'japan', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'unitedarabemirates', 'libya']",gb,False,False

This year had already registered 38 such days by mid-September.The more ambitious Paris Agreement target of 1.5C will be measured over decades.But lead author William Ripple, professor at Oregon State University, said we are likely entering a period where annual temperatures will reach that level or higher, risking danger from climate feedback loops and tipping points.""Once crossed, these tipping points could change our climate in ways that may be difficult or impossible to reverse,"" he told AFP.These could include the meltdown of the ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica, thawing of large areas of permafrost and widespread coral reef die back.With sometipping points""we're not going to avoid them now, it's more about slowing the damage"", said co-author Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of ExeterTo do that, emissions must be slashed and temperature rise curbed.Change in carbon emissions in Canada since 2003.Every fraction of a degree matters, Lenton told AFP: ""There's still a lot to play for.""That includes the number of people who might face intolerable conditions in coming decades, like severe heat, limited food availability and climate extremes.The report said three to six billion people could be ""confined beyond the livable region"" by century's end.""Many world leaders have generally continued to support business as usual, rather than enacting policies to curb climate change and sustain life on Earth,"" said Ripple.""We hope recent extreme weather events will help motivate policymakers at the upcoming COP28 climate conference to support massive cuts in fossil fuel emissions and increased funding forclimateadaptation, especially in the world's most vulnerable regions.""","['unitedarabemirates', 'brazil', 'us', 'china', 'india', 'canada', 'canada', 'canada', 'greenland']",gb,False,False

Unrelenting heat waves this summer resulted in heat-related deaths and knocked out power, leaving many without air conditioning.In order to better understand what communities are most affected by the impacts of climate change, researchers from the Environmental Defense Fund and Texas A&M University recently collaborated on a project to illustrate how climate threatens neighborhoods across the United States.TheClimate Vulnerability Index—a comprehensive tool that analyzed more than 70,000 tracts in the U.S.—allows people to search by location and learn what conditions shape their level of vulnerability. The study examined 184 indicators, including health, social economic impact, environment, extreme weather events and infrastructure, to draw its conclusions.""We created this tool, the CVI, the climate vulnerability index because we wanted to understand where the most disadvantaged communities are across the nation,"" Grace Lewis, a health scientist at EDF said adding the tool is a ""scientific approach"" to learning about the root of climate vulnerability.For example, the health factor included data on the number of adults diagnosed with long-term health conditions, the number of infectious diseases as well as access to affordable care. It took scientists about a year to conduct their research and collate the data onto a map.Lewis said this national tool initially came out of a research project in Houston that assessed the city's vulnerability to climate change. After realizing the benefit of a tool like this, scientists and economists embarked on a larger project to make this data available to everyone in the country.Another goal for the project is to help underserved communities secure funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act, according to a statement released by EDF earlier this month. The IRA is a climate and clean-energy bill signed by President Joe Biden last fall.""I think we've got this historic opportunity, and we can't let it pass us by,"" Lewis said. ""We need to think forward also about how we [invest] in electric vehicles and charging stations and energy.""Lewis said she hopes the map serves as a ""wake-up call"" to city planners and other decision-makers on how to build more resilient and sustainable communities.Where does Texas rank?Out of all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, Texas ranked No. 8 for overall climate vulnerability, placing it among the most vulnerable states.The main drivers behind this ranking include poor chronic-disease prevention, an abundance of food deserts and poor land use. When it comes to climate change impact, Texas ranked high in vulnerability for the costs of climate disasters, flooding and economic and productivity losses.The darker-colored areas on the map indicate places of higher climate vulnerability, while the lighter-colored regions indicate lower vulnerability. Texas is a larger, heterogenous state that has pockets of both, said one of the study's researchers, Dr. Weihsueh A. Chiu, who is also a professor at A&M's veterinary school.This type of shading indicates a pattern found across the U.S. that is linked to the socio-economic standing of different neighborhoods, Chiu explained. Affluent areas, which tend to have better health care and more robust infrastructure, can respond more easily to climate disasters, resulting in a lower vulnerability score. Meanwhile, less affluent areas, home to more factories and poor infrastructure, tend to rank higher in terms of their climate vulnerability.""Climate then becomes an equity issue because those communities are less able to respond to these new emerging threats from climate change,"" he said, adding many low-income areas lack the financial resources and proper infrastructure to help them in the face of climate threats.Unlike other climate screening tools, the CVI map accounts for infrastructure in addition to health and climate. Lewis said many maps illustrating the effects of climate change take into account two factors; it's typically rare for trackers to examine the intersection of health, environment, climate and infrastructure.""We take a very holistic and broad view ofvulnerabilityand recognize those infrastructures, social determinants of health,"" she said. ""They play a really important role in a community's ability to be adaptable.""The data indicates that the country's 10 most vulnerable counties are in the South, with several in Louisiana and Mississippi. St. John the Baptist, a parish in Louisiana, ranked as the most vulnerable county in the U.S.However, Lewis said she hopes people see the map as a way to instill positive change into their communities, rather than dwell on the negatives of climate change.""What areas do we need to fortify in order to foster resilience, because we know that climate is really having an immense impact?"" she said.She said she hopes people recognize from the study thatclimate changedoes not operate in a vacuum; instead,healthand environmental factors work together withclimateto impact a community's well-being.2023 The Dallas Morning News.

Nonetheless, little is known about the relationship of water use by sectors and the occurrence of drought-heat-wave events, particularly at the large scale.To explore this issue, a group of researchers from the Department of Physical Geography from Utrecht University evaluated the responses of sectoral water use during droughts, heat waves and compound (combined) events at a global scale. The study, ""Sectoral water use responses to droughts and heat waves: analyses from local to global scales for 1990-2019,"" published inEnvironmental Research Letters, shows that stronger sectoral water use responses are found for heat waves compared to impacts during droughts.The research is the first global study quantifying sectoral water use responses under extremes droughts, heat waves and compound events. Sectoral water use responses are understood as how the water use practices of sectors (namely domestic, irrigation, thermoelectric energy, manufacturing and livestock) are affected by the occurrence of droughts, heat waves and compound events, which could lead them to increase or decrease their use of water or to show no particular reaction to these hydroclimatic extremes.A large amount of data of sectoral water use at global, country and local scales during the last 30 years were analyzed. ""We focused on the water used by various sectors, namely irrigation, livestock, domestic, energy and manufacturing, because we expected particular responses to the occurrence of differentextreme events,"" says Gabriel Cardenas Belleza, Ph.D. candidate at Utrecht University and lead author of this publication.The analysis shows that extreme events over the last thirty years had substantial impacts on water use patterns, but these responses highly differ per sector and region across the world.""Socio-economic factors and public water management plans strongly influence water use responses, and even more so during extreme events. For instance, while Western continental United States decreases its water use during extremes, the central US increases it,"" says Cardenas. In addition, the results reveal that the domestic and irrigation sectors, in general, have the highest priority for water use worldwide, however, stricter measures are taken in favor of the domestic sector during extremes.The analysis also shows that heat waves and compound drought-heat wave events overall have stronger impacts on water use in comparison to solely droughts. ""Heat waves and compound events can lead to higher water use as a consequence of the temporary increase in water demand under high temperatures, which can still be satisfied due to the short duration of such extremes, compared to longer-lasting events like droughts,"" says Cardenas.The results of the study demonstrate the urgency of collecting more water use data to better understand the implications of extreme events andclimate changeon different water use sectors and for improved assessments of future water scarcity.""Our research provides a first step to evaluate multi-sectoral water use behavior during extremes. However, more local-scale information from data-scarce areas, like Africa and parts of Asia and South America, is needed to better understand sectoral water use behavior and improve water management strategies,"" Cardenas says.","['unitedstates', 'us']",gb,False,False

SAN DIEGO — Col. Thomas Bedell had been commanding Marine Corps Air Station, Miramar in San Diego for just one day, in July 2021, when he got a message from the base energy management director. The city power system was straining under a heatwave, and it was time to start up the microgrid. ""So I said, yes! Start up the microgrid! And then I texted, what is the microgrid?"" Bedell recalled with a laugh. It fell to Mick Wasco, who has been energy management director at Miramar since 2010, to explain to Bedell that Miramar was set up to run the base without using power from the city of San Diego in the case of a local or national power grid failure. ""By 2012, we started producing landfill gas electricity specifically for MCS Miramar,"" Wasco said, ""Keep in mind, this is the size of a small city.""

Using energy sources including solar and methane gas from the rotting garbage in a massive San Diego city landfill located inside the base, Miramar can go 21 days in a self-contained state that's called ""island mode."" Or as Col. Bedell says, aircraft carrier mode. ""I half-jokingly refer to Miramar as the USS Miramar. If you think about the installation as an aircraft carrier, suddenly the need to have redundant power to have energy-resilience, water, food-resilience makes complete sense,"" he said.

It makes enough sense that it's official Department of Defensepolicy: The Pentagon's stated goal is that all bases be ""power resilient."" The best path to resilience in case of a disaster is often a local renewable source, and that pairs well with another Pentagon goal — for bases to becarbon neutral by 2050. That will keep key defense capabilities intact in the case of an attack on the U.S. power grid, or more likely an extreme weather event, as climate change worsens droughts, heatwaves, wildfires and storms.

The rebuild is incorporating a microgrid built for the base by the local utility. ""Florida Power & Light provides us the ability to 'island' that critical headquarters building and its functions from the rest of the installation, should there be a power loss,"" says Mike Dwyer, deputy chief of the Air Force Natural Disaster Recovery Division. Getting industry partners involved made funding and building the microgrid faster than the Pentagon's normally glacial procurement process. In the next big storm, Dwyer said, the base will be able to keep up critical defense operations. ""It's designed to operate the first Air Force or Air Force's North Headquarters building completely independently for up to four and a half hours,"" he said. Dwyer said Tyndall is still at least 3 to 5 years away from having a grid that could run the whole base. A Pentagon spokesperson said 90% of key bases worldwide have at least a plan on becoming energy independent, and the Defense Department currently gets 15.9% of its energy from renewable sources, and expects to be at 25% renewable by 2025.

The DoD is among the world'slargest emitters of carbon dioxide,so it's exciting to see them take an interest in renewables, said Lisa Cohn with the site Microgrid Knowledge. ""The military's interest in microgrids is really, really important — because the military does tend to deploy new technologies before anyone else,"" she said. The progress is mostly driven by the fact that it makes tactical sense. It can save soldiers' lives at war. Producing energy on base means trucks don't have to haul in fuelfor generators to power bases in war zones, a vulnerability that proved deadly in Afghanistan and Iraq. Brandon Newell was a Marine artilleryman in 2003. He remembers rushing north from Kuwait into Iraq, only to run out of fuel. ""It was about speed and agility and moving fast to attack Baghdad. We outran our logistics and it was ... a pause for four days sitting on side of the road so that our logistics could catch up,"" he said. That experience marked him. Newell firstspoke to NPR in 2011at a remote combat outpost in Helmand, Afghanistan where he was setting up small-scale renewable power for the Marine Corps. Detail of diesel engine at MCAS Miramar.Alan Nakkash for NPRhide caption Newell says the troops don't really care if it's a carbon-neutral solution — as long as it helps them fight and survive. In Afghanistan, resupply convoys hit by roadside bombs were making up a huge share ofU.S. military casualties. ""We have these distributed forces that are constantly requiring bullets, band aids, food and fuel,"" he said, ""These huge convoys make you even more of a target."" Newell retired as colonel, and started a company promoting the mobile combat energy solutions he says will be even more important in the next war. He spent his last years in the Marine Corps helping stand-up the microgrid at Miramar Air Base. Miramar is also demonstrating how microgrids in the military can make the civilian power-grid more resilient. It can provide a working headquarters during storms or heatwaves for the state or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), according to Col. Bedell. ""Our ability to be able to continue to operate and provide that base from which we could help the local community or the state is really important,"" he said. It makes sense for every state to have disaster-resilient grids on military bases, he said, and Miramar has already helped out. During a heatwave in 2022, the state energy grid was under theheaviest load in California's history. This time, Bedell got a surprise text from San Diego Gas & Electric asking if Miramar could go off city power to reduce the load and avoid outages. ""At the request of SDG&E, we turned on the micro grid to support our own utility requirements during peak hours for 10 days in a row. And that that prevented about 3,000 homes from having to go into potential blackout,"" said Bedell. The Navy even ""unplugged"" its docked ships from the city's power grid to help. While the military tends to focus on the use of microgrids against tactical threats, Bedell says climate change itself is also one of those threats. ""We need to be part of this solution. And if we are negatively impacting the climate change that is causing societal disruption, that's not working ourselves out of a job. That's creating the problem that we're wanting to solve,"" he said.

[+] hardened their plants and taken steps to reduce flooding. They’ve also worked to improve communications between retailers and suppliers to anticipate disruptions, but storms still impact production. With three months left in 2023, the U.S. has already set a record for the most billion-dollar weather events in one year and, globally, the hottest summer on record. This kind of extreme weather plays a significant part in the volatility in the oil and gas sector, resulting in prices, supply and demand often swinging drastically from hour to hour. While shorter than recessions, weather events have super-sized effects on the entire oil and gas supply chain. Hurricanes Many kinds of weather can affect supply, from blizzards and ice storms to tornadoes and flooding, but most notable are tropical systems. Nearly half of the total petroleum refinery capacity and 51% of the total natural gas processing plant capacity in the United States is along the Gulf Coast, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This area is also historically in the path of many tropical storms and hurricanes. These storms don’t just impact land operations but also up to hundreds of miles out to sea, where extreme storms can disrupt everything from shipping routes to drilling platforms. According to the EIA, a “high impact” hurricane that disrupts Gulf of Mexico crude production by 80pc could increase monthly average retail gasoline prices by up to 30¢/USG. This year’s Hurricane Idalia put pressure on the Gulf operations, with three platforms evacuating employees, and traders watching the impending storm drive oil prices up in the days before landfall. In the past, other notable storms have impacted the industry, including Hurricane Zeta in 2021, which drove an 8-million-barrel drop in regional oil stocks that affected the broader U.S. supply. In response to the growing threats from these extreme storms, many refineries have hardened their plants and taken steps to reduce flooding. Extreme Temperatures We are already seeing cooler temperatures as we move into autumn, which is a relief from the months of unrelenting high temperatures. Extreme temperatures—hot or cold—have a significant impact beyond consumer demand. Refineries, which are typically designed to operate between 32 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit, can experience equipment malfunctions, reduce production capacity and create unsafe working environments, which can further delay operations under extreme heat conditions. Although tropical systems are typically associated with oil and gas disruption, extreme temperatures can cause more production loss. For example, in February 2021, frigid temperatures shut down more U.S. refinery capacity than Hurricane Harvey. The extended cold spell caused 5.6 million b/d of outages along the U.S. Gulf Coast and Midwest compared to Hurricane Harvey, reducing production of nearly 4 million barrels of oil per day. The bitter cold brought about by the 2021 Polar Vortex was a stark reminder of the cascading effect extremely low temperatures have on the oil and gas industry. The storm caused wellhead freeze-offs and power outages that debilitated gas producers, leading to a shortage of gas when demand was spiking. Gas shortages combined with iced-down processing units led to individual unit outages and entire closures at 25 refineries in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Tennessee. Freezing temperatures can cause malfunctions that might require a shutdown, such as flow control equipment failure or frozen product within the piping system. It can also create a hazardous situation when the weather warms up. When the temperature drops, the liquid freezes in the pipe and expands. This expansion can cause the pipe to crack, and once the temperature rises, the pipe will start to leak, creating a potential fire hazard. And even though we have moved beyond extreme high temperatures for now, it is important to note that extreme heat affects a refinery’s ability to run at full capacity and can limit the electricity supply refiners need to run their operations. For example, this year the utilization rate in the Gulf Coast fell in June and July, with several sizable outages in the region in July and August. The Increase of Extreme Weather Events As most research points to extreme weather events increasing in frequency and intensity, the oil and gas industry is already improving its preparation and response. The introduction of new standards, processes and hardened equipment indicates the industry is preparing for current weather impact and future climate changes. One area that can further build resilience is by tapping into integrated real-time weather insights. From optimizing shipping routes for vessels carrying natural gas and petroleum to protecting employees on offshore platforms, or proactively planning for unavoidable weather events, weather intelligence can enhance efficiencies and support safe operations. Further, when these weather insights, such as what regions, terminals and refineries are likely to be affected, are coupled with fuel demand data, supply chain players can plan ahead to make strategic supply, pricing and purchasing decisions.","['us', 'us', 'us', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",us,True,True

It was so bad that Austin Mayor Kirk Watsonwarned people to stay inside. ""People sometimes think, 'Well, I can beat the heat,'"" Watson said during a news conference in June. ""But with this heat, in this humidity, it's dangerous, and we need to pay attention to that."" It seems people across the state did stay home, and tourists stayed away as well, per recent research from theDallas Federal Reservethat found heat melted away $24 billion from Texas' economy. The Lone Star State's punishing andrecord-breaking heat wave,coupled with an unyielding drought, significantly affected local businesses and, by extension, thestate's economy. The ripple effects of the climate crisis were felt far and wide, echoing the urgent need for adaptive measures to mitigate future repercussions. Analyses used 20 years of datato demonstrate Texas' vulnerability to rising temperatures. For every 1-degree increase in average summer temperature, Texas sees a 0.4% slowdown in its annual nominal GDP growth. That is about twice as much as other states. A study from theJournal of Money, Credit and Bankingshowed a dip of 0.15% to 0.25% for the average state, with southern states impacted more. Whilerising temperatureshave impacted much of the country, Texas' already hot baseline summers are the reason for the difference, according to the Dallas Fed. ""The impact of an increase in summer temperatures on Texas GDP growth is twice as pronounced as the change in the rest of the US because summers are generally hotter relative to the rest of the country,"" the analysts wrote. In other words, an increase from 90 to 91 degrees is more costly than an increase from 70 to 71. The summer of 2023 was particularly harsh in Texas, with temperatures soaring 2.5 degrees above the state's post-2000 average. This anomaly, as the estimates suggest, may have cut annual nominal GDP growth by 1% for 2023, translating to a $24 billion loss. The Dallas Fed'sTexas Business Outlook Surveysin August found that 24% of 352 Texas businessesreported lower revenue or lower production due to the heat. Some industries were hit harder than others, notably leisure and hospitality. Notable establishments likeSchlitterbahn,SeaWorld, and Six Flagsblamed their dips in summer visitors on the heat wave. ""The extreme heat definitely kept people home,"" one respondent to the surveywrote. ""That, coupled with the economy and people leaving Texas to go on vacation in cooler climates like Colorado and Utah, also provides a decrease in revenue."" Austin, known for its vibrant social scene, witnessed an uncharacteristic lull this summer. One brewery owner in Austintold My San Antoniothat the summer heat ""crushed"" the city as several local breweries were forced to close their doors. To be sure, other factors may have had some of the breweries struggling already, including aboom in the local industrycreating more competition. And small businesses across industries may have been feeling the end of pandemic-era assistance programs like thePayroll Protection Program loansandEmployee Retention Credits. Many cities in Texas experiencedrecord-high temperaturesthis year, with some breaking decades-old records multiple times. The Dallas Fed did note that if the rise in temperatures is consistent year-round, some of the summer losses could be offset by a boost to the economy in the spring and fall. However, it would likely not compensate for the loss of out-of-state visitors more likely to travel during the summer months. Unfortunately for the tourism industry and places like breweries that often depend on outside seating for customers, there is no relief in sight. Projections by Texas A&M University'sOffice of the Texas State Climatologistpaint a grim future, with 100-degree days expected to nearly double by 2036, especially in urban areas. To put that in perspective,Austin averaged73 100-degree days in the last two years. The Dallas Fed concluded that the escalating frequency and severity of heat waves necessitate adaption. ""The economy can adapt,"" the analysts wrote. ""Theme parks such as Six Flags in Arlington are implementing new ways to protect customers from the heat byadding cabanasto provide additional shade. ""Communities may also adopt new technology to become more sustainable, create walkable neighborhoods or retrofit existing buildings to improve energy efficiency and seasonal ease of movement.""","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us']",us,True,True

This causes brighter, whiter clouds to form. These low marine clouds reflect sunlight away from the ocean's surface, protecting the marine life below from the worst of climate change.Australia'sReef Restoration and Adaptation Program—a collaboration between several universities, CSIRO and the Australian Institute of Marine Science—is exploring whether cloud brightening couldreduce coral bleaching. As an oceanographer and engineer I lead the program's research intocooling and shadingtechniques.We started exploring cloud brightening after the mass bleaching event in 2016. First, we needed to develop and test the underlying technologies in the lab. Then we began pilot testing in the central Great Barrier Reef near Townsville during January 2020. After several iterations we have now moved beyond ""proof of concept"" to investigating the response of the clouds themselves.The Cloud Brightening Field Trip of 2021. Credit: Southern Cross UniversityA bright ideaBritish cloud physicist John Latham originally proposed cloud brightening in 1990 as a way tocontrol global warmingby altering Earth's energy balance. He calculated that brightening clouds across the most susceptible regions of the world's oceans could counteract theglobal warmingcaused by a doubling of preindustrial atmospheric carbon dioxide. That's a level likely to be reached by the year 2060.Recently, scientists have begun to consider regional rather than global application of cloud brightening. Could brightening clouds directly over the Great Barrier Reef for a few monthsreduce coral bleachingduring a marine heat wave?Modeling studies are encouraging and suggest it coulddelay the expected decline in coral cover. This could buy valuable time for the reef while the world transitions away from fossil fuels.Lowering the heat stress on the ecosystem would produceother benefitswhen combined with other reef interventions—such as improved control of invasive crown of thorns starfish and planting of corals with increased heat tolerance.But these studies also show there's a limit to what can be achieved. Long-term benefits are only possible if the cloud brightening activity occurs alongside aggressive emissions reductions.Cloud brightening does haverisks as well as benefits, but the prospect of intermittent regional use is very different to large-scale ""solar geo-engineering"" proposals for shading and cooling the whole planet.We expect the regional effect will be short-lived and reversible, which is reassuring. The technology must be operated continuously to modify clouds and could be stopped at any time. The sea salt particles sprayed in the process typically only persist in the atmosphere forone to several days.How do you brighten a cloud?A warm cloud (as opposed to an ice cloud) is a collection of small water droplets floating in the air.A cloud of many small droplets is brighter than one with fewer large droplets—even if both clouds contain the same amount of water overall.Every droplet begins with the condensation of water vapor around a nucleus, which can be almost any kind of tiny particle suspended in air.Typically, in the lower atmosphere over land there are thousands to tens of thousands of these tiny particles suspended in every cubic centimeter of air. We call these airborne particles ""aerosols.""Aerosols may be naturalsuch as dust, sea salt, pollen, ash and sulfates. Or they may come from human activity such as burningfossil fuelsor vegetation, manufacturing, vehicle exhaust and aerosol spray cans.In very clean maritime air, the aerosols available to form clouds are mainlysulfates and sea salt crystals. And they are few and far between, only afew hundred per cubic centimeter.When a cloud forms under these conditions, water vapor is forced to condense around fewer nuclei, creatinglarger droplets and fewer of them. Large droplets reflect less light for the same volume of cloud water.To brighten such clouds, we can spray large quantities of microscopic seawater droplets into the air. This process of atomizing seawater mimics the generation of sea salt aerosols by wind and waves in the ocean. If these are incorporated into a cloud and create extra droplets, the cloud will be brightened.Sea salt also provides additional shade bydirect scattering of light.Testing the theoryAlthough scientists have researched cloud brightening for more than 30 years, no one had ever directly tested the theory. In Australia, we have now developed technology to a point where we are starting to measure the response of the clouds.We are beginning such tests with the support and permission of Traditional Owners, who have sustainably managed their Sea Country for tens of thousands of years.Our research program involves more than 15research institutionsand has multiple levels ofgovernanceand oversight.Not so far-fetchedMost people probably don't realize we are already inadvertently brightening the clouds. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates humanity's unintentional release of aerosolsoffsets around 30%of the warming effect due to greenhouse gases.Sulfates in ship exhaust are such a potent source of aerosols for droplet formation, the passage of ships leaves cloud trails calledship tracks.When the International Maritime Organization introduced new rules limiting the sulfur content of marine fuels, the number and extent of ship tracksdrastically reduced, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Arecent studyeven suggests the devastating heat wave that swept the Northern Hemisphere earlier this year was worsened by the absence of ship tracks.The world-first research we are conducting in Australia aims to determine if we could harness the clouds in an effective, environmentally responsible and socially acceptable manner for the future conservation of one of our most precious ecosystems.","['australia', 'australia', 'australia']",gb,False,False

Marine protected areas and similar conservation measures on land connect habitats fractured by generations of human development or erratically carved up by wildfires and heat waves.""Until now, marine protected areas have been designed for biodiversity conservation, but not necessarily for climate resilience,"" said Arafeh-Dalmau, a postdoctoral scholar in the Oceans Department at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and an honorary fellow at The University of Queensland. ""They suffer from climate impacts but aren't designed to endure them.""Enter the southern California bightAs acase study, the authors used the 21 biological and physical guidelines presented in their framework to map out protections for giant kelp ecosystems and species across the Southern California Bight. This vast region is distinguished by a gradual bend in the southerly trajectory of California's coastline where it curves to the southeast along the peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.Here, giant kelp forests provide nursery areas, shelter from predators and storms, and food to hundreds of commercially and culturally valuable species. In recent years, marine heat waves and prolonged periods of low dissolved oxygen have led to thecollapseof commercially valuable fisheries like jumbo squid and abalone, jeopardizing the livelihoods of local communities.Though Baja California is home to large marine protected areas and in the process of designing more, less than 1% of coastal waters are fully protected and prohibit extractive activities like fishing or drilling. In California, marine protected areas comprise 16% of state waters, half of which are fully protected. According to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, these protected waters make up the largest ecologically connected marine protected area network in the world.However, the network doesn't account for how species move between the U.S. and Mexico, which means even if one country protects species' nurseries, those benefits are lost if protections end a short drift into the neighboring country where larvae might settle and grow into adults.""We designed a systematic approach to help resource managers stay ahead of the curve and anticipate rather than react toclimate change,"" said co-lead author Adrian Munguia Vega, a genomics researcher at The University of Arizona and the Applied Genomics Lab in Mexico.""A big part of that is showing how entire marine ecosystems and the species that inhabit them are connected byocean currentsthat do not stop at the international border. Thus, we need coordinated efforts and protections across political boundaries.""A seal swims through a giant kelp forest in Baja California earlier this summer. Credit: Mission Blue/Eduardo SorensenIntegrating climateGovernment agencies charged with establishing new marine protected areas typically refer to biological and physical criteria developed by scientists over the past two decades. The study authors expanded these guidelines from acknowledging the need to address climate adaptations to explicitly planning for how various future climate scenarios might play out.For example, conservation planners today try to provide enough time for threatened species to recover from overfishing or habitat loss before allowing extractive or harvesting activities, but few models have considered how worsening marine heat waves will lengthen that recovery period. The new framework requires marine resource managers to evaluate whether proposed timelines will facilitate recovery ofvulnerable speciesover the next decade or even century.Management authorities also currently consider whether protected areas include the full range of habitats that regional species need to thrive. In the Southern California Bight, they might prioritize conserving a variety of sandy beaches, tidal flats, rocky reefs, and kelp forests. In addition to habitat diversity, the researchers prioritized habitat persistence or a habitat's presence over time.Considered ""climate refugia,"" these habitats often experience natural temperature swings from local currents and can provide consistent relief for species faced with extreme thermal shocks.""Climate extremes don't stop at the boundary of a marine protected area,"" said co-author Fiorenza Micheli, chair of the Oceans Department and co-director of the Center for Ocean Solutions. ""If California's network of marine protected areas had been designed with climate considerations, it would look different.""Putting the framework into practiceThe researchers examined decades of satellite imagery to map giant kelp persistence along 1,678 miles (2,700 kilometers) of continuous coastline in the Southern California Bight and quantify how many safe havens they provide for larvae spawned by sea cucumbers, sea urchins, abalone, and California sheephead.They found that under current protection schemes, marineheat wavesexpected over the next 50 years will splinter the suitable habitat for these larvae. The authors estimate ecological connectivity, a measure of the animals' ability to move freely from place to place, will fall by about half, while population density could decline by as much as 90%. This would mean smaller gene pools and greater risk of population collapse.Conventional assessment methods prioritize protection of areas that have the greatest number of kelp species. The new framework, by contrast, identified sites where kelp have the highest chance of survival and are more likely to provide a stable habitat for other marine species to reproduce. They recommended a series of protected areas thatlink isolated populationslike beads of a necklace along the Southern California Bight.""This stepping stone strategy can be very cost-effective and cheaper for everyone,"" said Arafeh-Dalamu, who documentedMexico's worst marine heat wavefrom 2014 to 2016. ""Maybe you need fewer areas to be protected if you are protecting the important areas."" Plus, he added, the collaboration between countries can strengthen research capacity, and ideally, diplomacy.""We have the information and tools to design and implement marine conservation in a way that explicitly and proactively accounts for climate change,"" said Micheli. ""Now is the time to understand where we strategically invest in expanding and strengthening protection so these ecosystems have a future.""","['us', 'us', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'australia', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'hungary']",gb,False,False

South America - which is coming out of its winter - also saw record high temperatures. This summer's record-breaking heat has extended to September.A new reportfrom theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, found that September 2023 was the hottest in its 174 years of climate records. The striking thing was just how abnormally hot September was, says Ellen Bartow-Gillies, a NOAA climatologist and the lead author of the report. ""This was the warmest September on record, but it also beat out the previous record September, which was in 2020, by 0.46 degrees Celsius, or 0.83 degrees Fahrenheit,"" Bartow-Gillies says. ""A pretty significant jump."" She said another way to think about it is that compared to the average July from 2001-2010, ""September 2023 was actually warmer than that."" Two things are primarily driving this. The first is climate change, which is mostly caused by humans burning fossil fuels. And Bartow-Gillies says this heat is also driven byEl Niño, a natural, cyclical climate pattern which drives up global temperatures. The September heat affected people all over the world– even in the Southern hemisphere which is coming out of winter, not summer. The NOAA report found North America, South America, Europe, and Africa had their warmest Septembers on record. A recent report from the World Weather Attribution Group, a research organization that partners with Imperial College, London and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, among others, found a link between the recent heat in South America and human-caused climate change. ""Across the world, we're seeing this trend of heat staying around longer than climatologically it should,"" Bartow-Gillies says. The NOAA report also found that Antarctica endured its warmest September to date, contributing torecord low sea ice. And the report found that ocean surface temperatures were unusually high. The warmer oceans helped fuel more intense storms fromNew York CitytoLibya, where dam failures caused thousands of deaths. Ultimately, these numbers have proved shocking to many, even climate scientists like Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist atClimate Central, who wasn't involved in the research. ""Geez, these numbers. Whew,"" she said as she looked at the report. ""A report like this really screams the urgency for advancing our climate actions,"" Woods Placky says, noting that some key ways to reduce emissions include shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy and changing how communities manage land. ""We've got someamazing climate solutionsthat already exist and some great people working on this around the globe,"" she says, ""But we just need to do it faster, and we need to do it bigger.""","['bolivia', 'bolivia', 'italy', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom']",us,False,False

The study on the state of the climate looked at recent data on 35 planetary ""vital signs"" and found 20 of these were at record extremes this year. Just roughly 1.2 degrees Celsius of temperature rise above pre-industrial levels has triggered a range of calamitous and costly consequences. This year has also seen the beginning of a warming El Nino weather phenomenon. The European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service has said that the three months to September were the hottest period ever recorded, and likely the hottest in approximately 120,000 years. Many climate-related records were broken by ""enormous margins"" in 2023, the report said, particularly temperatures in the oceans, which have absorbed almost all the excess heat caused by human carbon pollution. Co-author Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said recorded sea surface temperatures ""go completely off the chart"" and scientists are not yet able to fully explain why. The potentially serious impacts include threats to sea life and coral reefs and an increase in the intensity of large tropical storms, the report said. People across the planet have faced heatwaves and droughts this year, while severe flooding has struck in the US, China and India and beyond. In Canada, record wildfires partly related to climate change released more carbon dioxide than the country's total 2021 greenhouse gas emissions, the report said. Before 2023, days with global average temperatures more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels were a rarity, the authors said. This year had already registered 38 such days by mid-September. The more ambitious Paris Agreement target of 1.5C will be measured over decades. But lead author William Ripple, professor at Oregon State University, said we are likely entering a period where annual temperatures will reach that level or higher, risking danger from climate feedback loops and tipping points. ""Once crossed, these tipping points could change our climate in ways that may be difficult or impossible to reverse,"" he told AFP. These could include the meltdown of the ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica, thawing of large areas of permafrost and widespread coral reef die back. With some tipping points ""we're not going to avoid them now, it's more about slowing the damage"", said co-author Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter To do that, emissions must be slashed and temperature rise curbed. Every fraction of a degree matters, Lenton told AFP: ""There's still a lot to play for."" That includes the number of people who might face intolerable conditions in coming decades, like severe heat, limited food availability and climate extremes. The report said three to six billion people could be ""confined beyond the livable region"" by century's end. ""Many world leaders have generally continued to support business as usual, rather than enacting policies to curb climate change and sustain life on Earth,"" said Ripple. ""We hope recent extreme weather events will help motivate policymakers at the upcoming COP28 climate conference to support massive cuts in fossil fuel emissions and increased funding for climate adaptation, especially in the world's most vulnerable regions.""","['unitedarabemirates', 'us', 'china', 'india', 'canada', 'greenland']",us,True,False

""The truth is that we are shocked by the ferocity of the extreme weather events in 2023.

Althoughrenewable energyis increasing and rainforest depletion is slowing, ocean acidity, glacier thickness, and Greenland's ice mass all fell to record lows over the past two years, whilegreenhouse gas emissions, sea level rise and ocean temperatures rose to record highs.What's needed is a much faster phase-out of coal, oil and other fossil fuels, the researchers said in the study, which was published in the journalBioscience. They also recommended increased protections for the world's forests, more people eating plant-based diets, financial assistance to help the poorest countries deal with extreme weather disasters, and more family planning and women's education to voluntarily slow population growth.""We are in dire straits, but it's not too late,"" said William Ripple, lead author of the paper and a professor at the Oregon State University College of Forestry. ""The work we do now will make a huge difference.""Global temperatures have risen 2.1° Fahrenheit since 1880, mostly due to the burning offossil fuels, which traps heat in the atmosphere. The 10 warmest years on Earth since 1850, when consistent modern temperature records began, have all occurred since 2010, according to NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is the parent agency of the National Weather Service.This June through August was the warmest such period ever recorded, with record low levels of Antarctic sea ice. Many climate researchers say 2023 could break another record for the hottest year on record.Some significant environmental shifts are underway. This year in California, 25% of all new car sales are electric—nearly three times the national average. Washington state is second, at 18% and Oregon is third at 17%.Meanwhile, California is also breaking records every year in renewable energy use. In 2021, 37% of the state's electricity was generated by renewable sources such as solar and wind—more than double the 16% in 2012, according to new numbers released this summer by the California Energy Commission.Whennuclear powerand hydroelectricity fromlarge damsare included, 59% of California's electricity now comes from carbon-free sources. The state has a goal of 90% by 2035 and 100% by 2045.""I agree that the climate crisis is deeply serious and that progress in tackling it is much too slow,"" said biologist Chris Field, director of Stanford University's Woods Institute for the Environment. ""Still, we are seeing impressive progress in some areas.""Field noted that the price for solar andwind energycontinues to fall, the performance of electric vehicles is growing, and morelarge corporationshave pledged to reach ""net zero emissions.""Last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law requiring all corporations that operate in California with more than $1 billion in revenue to annually report their greenhouse gas emissions—a first-in the nation law that will include companies from Chevron to McDonald's, and allow the public to see who are the biggest polluters.""We need to find the political and economic will to dramatically accelerate the pace of change,"" Field said.On his first day in office in 2021, President Joe Biden signed an order committing the United States to re-enter the Paris Climate Agreement, a compromise among more than 190 nations to cut fossil fuel emissions that former President Donald Trump had pulled out of.Biden also pledged for the U.S. to cut greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030, and signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark bill that included $369 billion in tax breaks and incentives for solar, wind, electric vehicle production, battery charging stations and other climate investments. Biden appointed Michael Regan, a former vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, to run the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Trump, who is challenging Biden in next year's election, appointed Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist, to run the EPA when he was president. He attempted to expand offshore oil drilling along the California coast and in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, calledclimate change""a hoax,"" and incorrectly stated that wind turbines cause cancer.Traditionally, scientists have been encouraged by universities to publish findings in scientific journals but not do much outreach to the general public orpolitical leaders, said Ripple, the Oregon State scientist. But that's changing.""Scientists are starting to do a much better job of warning humanity of these major threats,"" he said.

But across five continents this year, it's also unleashed a different kind of disaster: deadly flooding.Cities around the world have seen record rainfall 139 times in 2023. A rare hurricane-like storm inundated Libya last month, killing thousands. More than 100 people died across Asia during an intense monsoon season in July. After fatal floods pummeled the U.S. Northeast over the summer,torrential rainsparalyzed New York City last week.Soaring temperatures were at the root of all these weather calamities. June, July and August were the hottest ever for that period. Higher air temperatures mean the atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall, while record-hot oceans provide fuel for storms. And as the climate warms, flooding is poised to get worse.""We are now seeing record-smashing ocean temperatures, record-smashing global temperatures and record-smashing floods,"" said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center. ""It's all connected.""In the U.S., two major flood events this year—in California from January to March and the Northeast in July—killed 32 people and caused $6.7 billion in damages, according to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information. The damages are the highest since 2019, when accounting only for flood incidents totaling more than $1 billion.Global damages are difficult to tally because not all countries keep accurate records, but flood events have left more than 17,000 people dead or missing in 2023. On average, there were 216 floods or landslides worldwide per year from 2019 to 2022, compared with an average of 160 over the previous four years, according to the International Disaster Database.In large part, the ever-worsening downpours are caused by what scientists call a ""positive feedback loop.""It works like this: The Earth's temperature rises in response to greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Hotter air holds morewater vapor, which then absorbs heat and prevents it from escaping the atmosphere—resulting in even more moisture in the air and heavier rainfall.Water vapor ""traps yet more heat and sets up a vicious cycle,"" Francis said.As the atmosphere gets warmer, so have the world's oceans. Higher water temperatures heat up the air above the sea surface, generating energy for hurricanes andtropical stormsto form. The Atlantic saw 10 storms develop from Aug. 20 to Sept. 16, the most on record for that period, according to Phil Klotzbach, a Colorado State University hurricane researcher.The storm that devastated Libya last month was a ""medicane,"" a name that's an amalgamation of Mediterranean and hurricane. Theseweather systemsare smaller than large Atlantic storms but can strike with Category 1 force on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, bringing winds greater than 74 miles per hour and flooding rains.Warmer water temperatures lead ""to a lot of evaporation from the oceans and more moisture in the atmosphere, and that provides the fuel for more rainfall in general,"" said Robert Adler, a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland. ""There is not much doubt that global warming in general is pushing us toward more intense rainfall events.""The total amount of rain that falls on Earth has only increased a small amount as the climate evolves, but what's changed is the intensity, Alder said.In the past, a hypothetical city may have seen 10 storms per month, each bringing an inch of rain. Now, a singlestormcan drop 10 inches of rain, overwhelming streets, drains and buildings that weren't constructed to handle that kind of deluge.""All the storms today can tap into that extra moisture, produce more rain, and increase the chances of flooding,"" Francis said. ""Water vapor is rocket fuel for storms—more of it means they can strengthen faster and become more intense.""Amplifying ocean heat this year is the weather pattern know as El Niño, which warms the equatorial Pacific's surface.Of course, this year's extreme weather hasn't been confined to flooding: Much of the world remains under dry conditions. A massive heat wave taxed energy grids across Texas and Mexico over the summer, throwing the U.S. Great Plains and Midwest deep into drought. But the increased frequency of both drought and flooding is evidence of global warming, said Lou Gritzo, chief science officer and staff senior vice president at commercial property insurer FM Global.""These things are not unrelated,"" Gritzo said. ""We are seeing exactly what we would expect to see in a changing climate.""How people use the land also can affect the severity of floods, said Deborah Brosnan, a climate scientist and founder of environmental risk consultancy Deborah Brosnan & Associates.In Libya, deforestation, unhealthy or depleted soil and poorly maintained dams all helped turn an extreme weather event into a human catastrophe, Brosnan said.But the risks aren't confined to developing nations. Climate change combined with urbanization all over the globe means higher rainfall, more pavement and fewer places for all that water to go when it hits the ground.""There is no area that is immune to this,"" Gritzo said. ""There is not a single continent that we can point to and say, 'This is not going to happen there.""'2023 Bloomberg News.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Citation: Record heat unleashes deadly floods from New York to Libya (2023, October 9) retrieved 3 November 2023 ","['libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'us', 'mexico']",gb,False,False

New data shows last month was the hottest September – thefourthconsecutivemonthof such unprecedented heat – putting 2023 firmly on track to be the hottest year in recorded history. September beat the previous monthly record set in 2020 by a staggering 0.5 degrees Celsius, according to data released Wednesday by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. There has never been a month so abnormally hot since Copernicus’ records began in 1940. “The unprecedented temperatures for the time of year observed in September – following a record summer – have broken records by an extraordinary amount,” said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, in a statement. The world has just experienced the hottest summer on record -- by a significant margin September felt more like an abnormally hot July with an average global air temperature of 16.38 degrees Celsius (61.45 Fahrenheit), making the month 0.93 degrees Celsius hotter than the 1991 to 2020 average, and 1.75 degrees Celsius hotter than the September average for the pre-industrial era, before the world started burning large amounts of fossil fuels. That’s well above the1.5 degrees Celsius thresholdto which countries aim to limit global warming under the Paris Climate Agreement. While that agreement focuses on longterm average temperatures, September’s abnormal heat – which followed thehottest summer ever recorded– has given a preview of what the world can expect as soaring temperatures supercharge extreme weather. September alone brought devastating flooding thatkilled thousands in Libyaanddozens across Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey. Canada grappled with itsunprecedented wildfireseason, parts of South Americawere scorchedby record-breaking heat andrecord rainfalldeluged New York. Ocean temperatures were also off the charts in September. Average sea surface temperatures reached 20.92 degrees Celsius (69.66 Fahrenheit), the highest on record for September and the second-highest on record for any month, after August of this year. Antarctic sea ice also reached record lows for this time of year. “This month was, in my professional opinion as a climate scientist – absolutely gobsmackingly bananas,” Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist,posted on X(formerly Twitter) on Tuesday. Even in October, there is little sign of heat dying down. European countries, including Spain, Poland, Austria and France, have alreadybroken their all-time October temperature records, according to Maximiliano Herrera, a climatologist and weather historian who tracks extreme temperatures. What Europe experienced in the first three days of October was “one of the most extreme (climate) events in European history,” Herreraposted on Xon Tuesday. It now appears all but certain that this year will be the hottest year on record. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration puts the chances of reaching this milestoneat more than 93%. The extreme September “has pushed 2023 into the dubious honor of first place – on track to be the warmest year and around 1.4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial average temperatures,” Burgess said. 'Not nearly enough.' IEA says fossil fuel demand will peak soon but urges faster action The high temperatures have been partially fueledby El Niño, the natural climate pattern that originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean and has a warming effect. But underlying that pattern is the longterm trend of human-caused climate change. “Temperature records continue to be broken because we have not stopped burning fossil fuels. It is that simple,” said Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment in the UK. The significant margin by which heat records are being broken matters, she told CNN. “People and ecosystems are dying.” Countries will gather in Dubai for the United Nations COP28 climate summit in December where they will assess progress towards climate goals. The world is currentlya long way off track, according to a recent report. “The significant margin by which the September record was broken should be a wake-up call for policymakers and negotiators ahead of COP28,” Otto said, “we absolutely must agree to phase out fossil fuels.”","['not found', 'not found', 'greece', 'bulgaria', 'turkey', 'canada', 'unitedstates', 'spain', 'poland', 'austria', 'france', 'uk', 'unitedarabemirates']",us,True,False

Much of the world sweltered through unseasonably warm weather in September, in a year expected to be the hottest in human history and after the warmest-ever global temperatures during the Northern Hemisphere summer. September's average surface air temperature of 16.38 degrees Celsius (61.5 degrees Fahrenheit) was 0.93C above the 1991-2020 average for the month and 0.5C above the previous 2020 record, the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in a report. Temperature records are normally broken by much smaller margins closer to one-tenth of a degree. The report said the figure was ""the most anomalous warm month"" in its dataset going back to 1940 and around 1.75C hotter than the September average in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period. ""We've been through the most incredible September ever from a climate point of view. It's just beyond belief,"" C3S director Carlo Buontempo told AFP. ""Climate change is not something that will happen 10 years from now. Climate change is here."" The unprecedented September temperatures ""have broken records by an extraordinary amount"", added C3S deputy director Samantha Burgess. Global average temperatures from January to September were 1.4 degrees Celsius higher than 1850-1900, almost breaching the 1.5C warming goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement, C3S reported. That threshold was the more ambitious target of the accord and is seen as essential to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of climate change. The January-September average global temperature was 0.05C higher than the same nine-month period in 2016, the warmest year recorded so far. The El Nino phenomenon -- which warms waters in the southern Pacific and stokes hotter weather beyond -- is likely to see 2023 becoming the hottest year on record in the next three months. Scientists expect the worst effects of the current El Nino to be felt at the end of 2023 and into next year. Although El Nino played a role in the warming, ""there's no doubt that climate change has made it much worse"", Buontempo told AFP. Europe experienced its hottest September on record at 2.51C higher than the 1991-2020 average, with many countries smashing national temperature records for the month. The average sea surface temperature for the month excluding the polar regions also reached all-time highs for September, at 20.92C. Scientists say warmer sea surface temperatures driven by climate change is making extreme weather events more intense, with Storm Daniel sparking devastating floods in Libya and Greece in September. Antarctic sea ice remained at a record low level for the time of year, while monthly Arctic sea ice was 18 percent below average, C3S added. Oceans have absorbed 90 percent of the excess heat produced by human activity since the dawn of the industrial age, according to scientists. Warmer oceans are also less capable of absorbing carbon dioxide, exacerbating the vicious cycle of global warming as well as disrupting fragile ecosystems. ""This kind of event is in line with projections made over the last couple of decades,"" said Doug McNeall, a climate scientist and statistician at the UK Met Office's Hadley Centre. ""It's shocking when you see these records being broken, and the impact that's having on people's lives and ecosystems,"" he told AFP. ""Our climate is out of control,"" Bill McGuire, a climate scientist and professor at UCL university in London, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. World leaders will gather in Dubai from November 30 for crunch UN climate talks known as COP28 as the consequences of global warming accelerate. Finding a consensus on slashing the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change, financing for adaptation and mitigation and boosting renewable energy will be key negotiating topics. The United Nations on Wednesday said there were ""divergent views"" among parties over how to reach the Paris goals, even if they agreed that past climate action has been insufficient. Pope Francis had earlier warned the world ""is collapsing"" due to global warming, urging COP28 participants to agree to binding policies on phasing out fossil fuels. ""Two months out from COP28 -- the sense of urgency for ambitious climate action has never been more critical,"" said Burgess.","['senegal', 'senegal', 'libya', 'greece', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedarabemirates', 'france']",us,False,False

Climate change threatens to reverse decades of progress towards better health and well-being, particularly in the most vulnerable communities. Scientific know-how and resources can help redress the balance, but are not sufficiently accessible or utilized, according to a new multi-agency report coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). WMO's annual State of Climate Services report this year focuses on health. It highlights the need for tailored climate information and services to support the health sector in the face of more extreme weather and poor air quality, shifting infectious disease patterns and food and water insecurity. ""Practically the whole planet has experienced heatwaves this year. The onset of El Nino in 2023 will greatly increase the likelihood of breaking temperature records further, triggering more extreme heat in many parts of the world and in the ocean - and making the challenge even greater,"" says WMO Secretary-General, Prof Petteri Taalas . ""It is clear that by channelling investment and boosting collaboration, there is huge potential to go further and faster by enhancing the impact of climate science and services so that health partners get the support they need at a time when unprecedented changes to our climate are having an increasing impact,"" add Prof. Taalas. The report, which includes input from more than 30 collaborating partners, features case studies from around the world showcasing how integrated climate and health action makes a very real difference in people's daily life. This includes early warning systems for extreme heat, pollen monitoring to help allergy sufferers and satellite surveillance for climate-sensitive diseases. ""The climate crisis is a health crisis, driving more severe and unpredictable weather events, fuelling disease outbreaks, and contributing to higher rates of noncommunicable diseases,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. ""By working together to make high-quality climate services more accessible to the health sector, we can help to protect the health and well-being of people facing the perils of climate change."" Nearly three quarters of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) provide climate data to the health sector, but the uptake is limited. Less than one quarter of Ministries of Health have a health surveillance system that utilizes meteorological information to monitor climate-sensitive health risks. Early Warnings for All The number of medium- or large-scale disaster events is projected to reach 560 a year - or 1.5 each day - by 2030. Countries with limited early warning coverage have disaster mortality that is eight times higher than countries with substantial to comprehensive coverage, according to figures cited in the report. A special section is devoted to extreme heat, which causes the greatest mortality of all extreme weather. However the impacts are underestimated as heat-related mortality could be 30 times higher than what is currently recorded. Heat warning services are provided to health decision makers in only half of the affected countries, but are expected to rapidly increase by 2027 under the international Early Warnings for All initiative. Between 2000 and 2019, estimated deaths due to heat were approximately 489,000 per year, with a particularly high burden in Asia (45%) and Europe (36%). Extreme heat conditions during the summer of 2022, were estimated to have claimed over 60,000 excess deaths in 35 European countries. Heatwaves also exacerbate air pollution, which is already responsible for an estimated 7 million premature deaths every year and is the fourth biggest killer by health risk factor. Climate change is exacerbating risks of food insecurity. In 2012-2021, 29 per cent more global land area was affected by extreme drought for at least one month per year than in 1951-1960. The compounding impacts of droughts and heatwave days were associated with 98 million additional people reporting moderate to severe food insecurity in 2020 than annually in 1981-2010, in 103 countries analysed, according to figures cited in the report. The changing climatic conditions are also enhancing the transmission of many climatically sensitive infectious vector-, food-, and water-borne diseases. For example, dengue is the world's fastest-spreading vector-borne disease, whilst the length of the malaria transmission season has increased in parts of the world. Some of the most significant challenges to health are in the nexus of water, food security and nutrition, the nexus of infectious diseases (food-, water-, airborne and vector-borne diseases), and the nexus of extreme weather and air quality, particularly in urban areas, says the report. Key messages: Climate change undermines health determinants and increases pressures on health systems threatening to reverse decades of progress to promote human health and well-being, particularly in the most vulnerable communities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes, with very high confidence, that future health risks from injury, disease, and death will increase due to more intense and frequent temperature extremes, cyclones, storms, floods, droughts, and wildfires. It is anticipated that over 50 per cent of the excess mortality resulting from climate change by the year 2050 will occur in Africa. Health protection is a priority in almost all countries and requires high-quality information to better inform decision-making. Climate information and services are fundamental for better understanding how and when health systems and population health can be impacted by climate extremes and a changing climate, and for managing climate-related risks. Climate information and services are fundamental for better understanding how and when health systems and population health can be impacted by climate extremes and a changing climate, and for managing risks. Tailored climate products and services can enhance the evidence and information available to health partners to detect, monitor, predict, and manage climate-related health risks. There is huge potential for enhancing the benefits of climate science and climate services for the health sector and for increasing accessibility, relevance and uptake. Only 31 per cent of NMHSs provide climate services at a 'full' or 'advanced' level of capacity. A large range of academic, private sector, and government partners are also working to fill the gap, and this needs to be put on a sustainable and coordinated footing. Extreme heat causes the greatest mortality of all extreme weather, yet heat warning services are provided to health decision makers in only half of the affected countries. According to the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change, rising temperatures and the growing over-65 population have triggered an increase in heat-related mortality in this age group of approximately 68 per cent between 2017-2021, compared to 2000-2004. According to the IPCC, there is ""high confidence"" that Central and South America, southern Europe, southern and Southeast Asia and Africa will be the most affected by climate change in terms of heat-related mortality by 2100, based on 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C increases in the global temperature. The IPCC also notes with ""very high confidence"" significant impacts of heat are expected from the combination of future urban development and the more frequent occurrence of heatwaves, with more hot days and warm nights adding to heat stress in cities. Concerns relating to air quality, climate change, and health are interlinked. Climate mitigation action leading to reducing air pollution can save lives. Despite this, only 2 per cent of climate finance commitments made by international development funders in developing and emerging countries is explicitly aimed at tackling air pollution (in 2015-2021), even though it is the most dangerous environmental threat to health. In 2019, air pollution moved up from the fifth to the fourth place in the scale of leading risk factors for death globally, continuing to exceed the impacts of other widely recognized risk factors for chronic disease like obesity, cardiovascular disease, and malnutrition. There is insufficient investment to improve the capabilities of the health sector, leaving it ill-prepared to safeguard the most vulnerable. Currently, just 0.2 per cent of total bilateral and multilateral adaptation finance supports projects that identify health as the primary focus, and the investment in the capacity for multisectoral and effective climate science and services is miniscule."" Most hydrometeorological investments are not clearly designed to support health outcomes. This needs to change. To fully harness the potential of climate services for health, transformational change in institutional development and integration across the health and climate sectors are needed. In the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic, all countries have experienced the social and economic losses and damages which can occur when the health of society is compromised. More must be done to prepare the health community for future shocks and pressures they may experience due to climate variability and the damaging effects of climate change. The governing World Meteorological Congress in 2023 approved a 10-year strategy on Advancing Integrated Climate, Environment, and Health Science and Services (2023-2033) in collaboration with WHO and other health partners to address the challenges.

Climate change threatens to reverse decades of health and well-being progress, especially in vulnerable communities, said the joint report ""State of Climate Services"" by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and World Health Organization (WHO). Between 2000 and 2019, estimated deaths due to heat were approximately 489,000 per year, with a particularly high burden - 45% - in Asia. Countries with limited early warning coverage, most of which were vulnerable Asian and African nations, experience disaster mortality rates eight times higher than those with an extensive range, the report said. Burmese construction worker Rajendra G, 40, works as a daily wage laborer at a construction site in Bangkok. During the summer, he said the workers were given breaks due to extreme heat. ""It was impossible to work outside, especially between 11 and 2. So, we started early, took a break during the day, and worked in the evening again,"" Rajendra, who declined to give his family name, told Radio Free Asia. ""Some of our friends fainted, but thank God, no one was seriously ill."" Rajendra G is one of the millions, including street vendors, cleaners, farmers, and other informal economy workers, who bore the brunt of the unprecedented heatwaves, with record-setting temperatures in most of Southeast Asia, China, and other parts of Asia this summer, as the world entered what U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called a period of ""global boiling."" Schools were shut down, and power grids struggled to cope as air conditioners were turned on full blast at homes, offices, and factories. In India, at least 170 people died, as hospitals and health systems in parts of the country, as well as in Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand, came under severe strain due to heatwave-related admissions. The World Weather Attribution (WWA), a group of global scientists, said that the heat wave in Southeast Asia was expected ""once in 200 years,"" which would have been nearly unthinkable without the influence of human-induced climate change. Scientists say the rising temperature is due to carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels and the emergence of El Niño, a climate phenomenon characterized by the periodic warming of the equatorial Pacific. ""Practically the whole planet has experienced heatwaves this year,"" WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said Thursday. ""The onset of El Niño in 2023 will greatly increase the likelihood of breaking temperature records further, triggering more extreme heat in many parts of the world and in the ocean - and making the challenge even greater."" Better climate health services needed The U.N.'s Thursday report, with input from 30 other partners, came as scientists said 2023 is most likely to be the warmest on record, as every month since June has been the hottest month for each respective month, as well as the highest daily average surface air temperature on July 6. Heatwaves also exacerbate air pollution, which rose to the fourth leading cause of global premature deaths in 2019, responsible for around 7 million annual fatalities, surpassing well-known risk factors such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and malnutrition. According to Joy Shumake-Guillemot, who leads the WHO/WMO Joint Office for climate and health, heatwave mortality could be 30 times higher than recorded, with just 54% of countries in the world receiving warnings that tell them how to protect their health during a heatwave. Changing climate conditions amplify the spread of climate-sensitive diseases, making dengue the world's fastest-spreading vector-borne disease and increasing the length of the malaria transmission season in Asia and Africa. The report emphasized the need for customized climate information and services to help the health sector deal with extreme weather, poor air quality, changing disease patterns, and food and water insecurity, citing limited access to scientific resources as a critical challenge. It said about three-quarters of national weather services supply climate data to the health sector. Yet, less than a quarter of health ministries use meteorological information for climate-related health monitoring. ""The climate crisis is a health crisis, driving more severe and unpredictable weather events, fuelling disease outbreaks, and contributing to higher rates of noncommunicable diseases,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. By 2030, there will be around 560 medium to large-scale disasters each year, roughly 1.5 per day, the report warned, emphasizing that nations lacking comprehensive early warning systems face an eightfold increase in disaster-related fatalities compared to those with robust coverage. The report highlighted global case studies demonstrating the tangible benefits of combining climate and health efforts. In Fiji, enhanced integrated risk monitoring and climate-informed early warning systems have helped people better prepare and respond to climatic changes, reducing morbidity and mortality from climate-sensitive diseases, said Shumake-Guillemot. In Myanmar, satellites help integrate climate and environmental data into health surveillance to issue early warnings for leptospirosis, a bacterial disease common in Southeast Asia, often undiagnosed, and associated with waterborne outbreaks following heavy rainfall and floods. The report also pointed to the development of an integrated early warning system for dengue in Vietnam of up to six months in advance, where there has been an increase of over 100% in the number of cases of dengue fever since 2000. In Laos, efforts to bolster vulnerable settlements provided clean water, sanitation, and health infrastructure to 130,000 people, while 189 villages received climate resilience and sustainable infrastructure training, including maintenance and land use guidance.

Invasive species are also known for rapid growth rates and a greater competitive edge that might allow them to recolonise faster. Only in the case of marine animals were both natives and non-natives relatively immune to extreme weather -- although native molluscs and corals are vulnerable to heat waves.Invasive species are not a new problem, but they are growing one. The intergovernmental science advisory panel for the UN Convention on Biodiversity (IPBES) revealed in a landmark report in September that invasive species were increasing at an ""unprecedented rate"" globally, costing more than $400 billion dollars a year in damages and lost income. Invasive species mainly spread as hitchhikers on global trade and played a significant role in 60 percent of all documented plant or animal extinctions, it said.",['china'],in,False,False

Labour MSP Monica Lennon's member's bill would make Scotland the first part of the UK to enforce tough penalties for ecocide - the mass destruction of the environment. She has launched a consultation which ends in February. The government said Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater would meet Ms Lennon to discuss the proposals. It came as it was confirmed First Minister Humza Yousaf will attend the COP28 climate summit in Dubai later this month. The ecocide legislation would make Scotland the first part of the UK to incorporate a crime of ecocide - defined as ""unlawful or wanton acts"" which cause widespread environmental damage. It is intended to deter and punish events such as oil spills caused by corporate negligence, while deforestation or illegal fishing could also be within its scope. The legislation would set a minimum jail sentence of 10 years for the crime of ecocide, with a maximum of 20 years. Ms Lennon said action was needed as ""Scotland is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world"". ""The maximum of 20 years maybe does sound a bit harsh, but we're talking here about the most severe impact that could have irreversible damage, it could be destroying a whole ecosystem,"" the Labour MSP told reporters at a launch event in Edinburgh. She said the law would complement existing environmental legislation and provide an overarching deterrent for those who may wish to skirt the current regulations. Ms Lennon added: ""If people are worried that they might be an ecocide criminal, get yourself a good lawyer."" After the consultation phase ends, the members' bill would have to gain the support of at least 18 MSPs before it could progress further. Around the world, 13 countries legally recognise some form of ecocide and there is a growing movement for it to be codified in international law. The proposed bill is supported by Stop Ecocide International - a campaign backed by Greta Thunberg, Pope Francis and Sir Paul McCartney. Meanwhile, it was announced that the first minister, Net Zero Secretary Mairi McAllan and a delegation of Scottish companies will head to Dubai for the COP28 climate conference, which begins on 30 November. The Scottish government was criticised this week for delaying the publication of its climate change plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2045, five years ahead of the date set for the UK as a whole. Ministers blamed scaled-back UK government targets for the postponement. Mr Yousaf said: ""COP28 provides an opportunity to underline Scotland's commitment to being a good global citizen, and making a constructive contribution to addressing global challenges such as the biodiversity and the climate crisis. ""The Scottish government will use COP28 to call on all to urgently step up to address the injustice at the heart of climate change by supporting those communities who are suffering the most but have done the least to cause climate impacts, including through our leadership on loss and damage."" He added that the Scottish companies in attendance would aim to attract investment and ""enhance Scotland's global reputation, particularly on renewable energy"". Scottish Conservative net zero spokesman Douglas Lumsden said Mr Yousaf ""would be better off getting his own house in order before he swans off to grandstand at COP28, given the SNP government's poor record on the environment"". He added: ""The SNP has always enjoyed talking up this issue - and blaming the UK government - at this sort of event, but there's precious little delivery on the rhetoric."" COP28 is the 28th annual United Nations climate meeting at which governments discuss how to limit and prepare for future climate change. COP26 was held in Glasgow in 2021. Controversially, this year's event is being held in the UAE - one of the world's top 10 oil-producing nations. Following a meeting with Mr Yousaf to discuss Scotland's climate progress and the priorities for COP28, Oxfam Scotland chief Jamie Livingstone urged the first minister to use next month's Scottish Budget to ""start fairly raising the additional funds needed for transformative climate action"". He also called on the government to incentivise the country's biggest and wealthiest polluters to ""change their damaging behaviours"". COP28 comes during what is almost certain to be the hottest year on record, after four months of global temperature records being ""obliterated"", climate scientists have said. October was the hottest ever recorded, following the hottest September, August and July, the latter of which may have seen temperatures higher than at any point in the last 120,000 years. The month was 1.7C warmer than the pre-industrial average between 1850 and 1900 - the baseline against which scientists measure how much humans have warmed the Earth by emitting greenhouse gases. So far this year, the average temperature is 1.43C higher than this pre-industrial average, making it the hottest year on record. The Met Office said it would take a record-breaking cold November and December for 2023 to avoid becoming the hottest year, surpassing the record set in 2016. The UK had slightly higher than usual average temperatures in October, with southern England seeing between 1.5C and 2C above the 1991-2020 October average. Eastern Scotland had its wettest month on record following Storm Babet, with many other parts of the UK experiencing similar conditions. Scientists have said the UK will become warmer and wetter because of climate change, as the atmosphere holds 7% more water with every degree of warming.","['unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'not found']",gb,True,True

The increased global temperatures this year are linked to man-made emissions, scientists say, as well as the naturally-occurring El Nino weather system, which warms surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. CS3 said in a statement that 2023 is“virtually certain”to break the previous record set in 2016, which was also an El Nino year. The only other time on record in which global surface air temperatures exceeded expectations by such a large margin was September 2023. Researchers have indicated that extreme temperatures are expected to persist in 2024. “When we combine our data with the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), we can say that this is the warmest year for the last 125,000 years,”Burgess said, adding that she was“really, really surprised”by the findings. The uptick in global temperatures directly corresponds to an increase in human suffering, according to Dr. Friederike Otto from Imperial College London. “Within this year, extreme heatwaves and droughts, made much worse by these extreme temperatures, have caused thousands of deaths, people losing their livelihoods, being displaced, etc.”he said, as per the BBC on Wednesday.“These are the records that matter.” Scientists have blamed man-made climate change for a series of disasters which have happened throughout 2023, including floods that killed thousands in Libya, South American heatwaves and Canada’s worst-ever season of forest fires - which Piers Foster, a climate scientist at the UK’s University of Leeds, warned could become commonplace. “We must not let the devastating floods, wildfires, storms, and heatwaves seen this year become a new normal,”he said via Reuters, explaining that by“rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions”the rate of warming can be halved. The topic is expected to dominate the UN’s COP28 climate change summit, set to begin in Dubai on November 30.","['senegal', 'libya', 'canada', 'uk', 'unitedarabemirates']",ru,False,False

The prediction follows ""exceptional"" high October temperatures. Global average air temperatures were 0.4C warmer than the previous high of October 2019, according to the EU's climate change service. Driven by carbon emissions and an El Niño weather event, this was the fifth month in a row of record warmth. Extreme global temperatures will likely continue into 2024, researchers say. That this year will be the warmest ever recorded is now pretty much unavoidable: the last two months of 2023 are extremely unlikely to reverse the trend and high temperatures around the world have continued into November. October's temperature mark adds to this year's list of tumbling global heat records. The number of days breaking through the politically significant 1.5C warming threshold has already reached a new high, well before the end of the year. July was so warm that it may have been the hottest month in 120,000 years, while average September temperatures smashed the previous record by a ""gobsmacking"" 0.5C. October was not quite as unusually hot as September but still breaks the record for the month by an ""exceptional"" margin, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service. The month was 1.7C warmer than the pre-industrial average - meaning compared with the period before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels. The warmth experienced throughout the year so far means that 2023 is ""virtually certain"" to become the world's warmest year on record, beating 2016. That's the view of a number of science bodies, including Copernicus and US groups NOAA and Berkeley Earth. ""We really see no sign that this year's string of exceptional record-setting months is going away anytime soon,"" said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth. ""And at this point, it makes it virtually certain in all the datasets that 2023 will be the warmest year on record. That's a greater than 99% chance,"" he told BBC News. While many researchers are concerned about the scientific impacts of record-breaking temperatures this year, others point to the fact that the rising mercury has real world consequences. ""The fact that we're seeing this record hot year means record human suffering,"" said Dr Friederike Otto from Imperial College London, commenting on the findings. ""Within this year, extreme heatwaves and droughts made much worse by these extreme temperatures have caused thousands of deaths, people losing their livelihoods, being displaced etc. These are the records that matter."" The main driver of the heat is ongoing emissions of carbon dioxide, mainly from burning fossil fuels. It is being supplemented this year by the rise of El Niño - a natural event where warm waters come to the surface in the east Pacific Ocean and release extra heat into the atmosphere. El Niño conditions have gained strength over recent months, but have not yet reached their peak. ""This El Niño is weird. Part of the heat we're experiencing is not just due to the increase in El Niño, it's due to this rapid switch out of (ocean-cooling weather event) La Niña conditions as well, that has been suppressing temperatures for the last few years,"" said Dr Hausfather. Scientists are uncertain as to whether this Niño event is different from others in recent decades. Some are concerned that it might be driving greater heating at the ocean surface than during previous events such as the ones in 1997 and 2015. The jury is still out on that. The year to date has been a record 1.43C warmer than the pre-industrial levels according to Copernicus, with temperatures expected to remain high in the coming months. Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, said that a combination of its data and that of the UN suggested 2023 may be ""warmer than anything that the planet has seen for 125,000 years"". That conclusion is based on observations at weather stations, complex computer models of the climate system, and records of the climate far back in time from ice cores and tree rings, for example. It sets the worrying climate context ahead of the UN's COP28 summit, which begins on 30 November. ""The sense of urgency for ambitious climate action going into COP28 has never been higher,"" said Dr Burgess. October temperatures were much higher than average globally, and different parts of the world faced extreme conditions. High temperatures around the world have continued into November with hundreds of heat records already broken this month in Japan. Europe meanwhile saw temperatures over 35C for the first time ever in November, with high readings in several parts of Greece. As these temperatures surge, there are concerns that further extreme events may follow in the coming months. For example, parts of Australia have already been warned of an ""increased risk"" of wildfires.","['poland', 'us', 'japan', 'greece', 'australia']",gb,False,False

With temperatures soaring beyond previous averages by exceptional margins, scientists say the pressure on world leaders to curb planet-heating greenhouse gas pollution has never been more urgent as they prepare to meet in Dubai for the UNCOP28 climate conference this month. Drought parched parts of the United States and Mexico during October, while huge swathes of the planet saw wetter than normal conditions often linked to storms and cyclones, said the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). Sea surface temperatures were the highest ever recorded for the month, a phenomenon driven by global warming that scientists say plays a key role in driving storms to be more ferocious and destructive. ""October 2023 has seen exceptional temperature anomalies, following on from four months of global temperature records being obliterated,"" said Samantha Burgess, C3S Deputy Director. ""We can say with near certainty that 2023 will be the warmest year on record, and is currently 1.43 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average. The sense of urgency for ambitious climate action going into COP28 has never been higher."" The landmark Paris Agreement saw nearly 200 countries pledge to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era and preferably a safer 1.5C. These temperature thresholds will be measured as an average over several decades, rather than a single year. This year has also seen the beginning of a warming El Nino weather phenomenon -- which warms waters in the southern Pacific and stokes hotter weather beyond -- although scientists expect the worst effects to be felt at the end of 2023 and into next year. October was 1.7C warmer than an estimate of the October average for the preindustrial era, Copernicus said. Global average temperatures since January have been the highest in records going back to 1940, the monitor added, registering 1.43C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average. Beyond these official records, scientists say proxy data for the climate going back further -- like tree rings or ice cores -- suggests the temperatures seen this year could be unprecedented in human history, potentially the warmest in more than 100,000 years. Average sea surface temperatures for the month excluding the polar regions also reached all-time highs for October, at 20.79C. Oceans have absorbed 90 percent of the excess heat produced by human activity since the dawn of the industrial age, according to scientists. Warmer oceans are linked to an increase in the intensity of storms and the melting of crucial ice shelves buffering the vast ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, threatening destructive sea level rise. A warmer atmosphere also holds more moisture, resulting in heavier rainfall. Leaders meeting in the United Arab Emirates for the November 30 to December 12 COP28 conference will have to respond to a damning progress report on the world's Paris pledges after major scientific reports have made clear that the world is far off track. Carbon emissions -- largely from fossil fuels -- continue to creep up when they need to be slashed in half this decade. Just under 1.2 degrees Celsius of temperature rise above pre-industrial levels has triggered a range of calamitous and costly weather extremes. People across the planet have faced heatwaves and droughts this year, while severe flooding has struck in the US, China and India and beyond. The report warned that humanity had veered into ""uncharted territory"" with warming that imperils life on Earth. Lead author William Ripple, a professor at Oregon State University said it was likely that annual average temperatures would start to be recorded above 1.5C. ""As warming continues, we face increasing danger from amplifying climate feedback loops and tipping points such as ice sheet melting and forest dieback,"" he said. ""Once crossed, these tipping points could change our climate in ways that may be difficult or impossible to reverse.""","['unitedarabemirates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'mexico', 'senegal', 'senegal', 'greenland', 'france', 'us', 'china', 'india']",us,True,True

October was a whopping 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the previous record for the month in 2019, surprising even Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, the European climate agency that routinely publishes monthly bulletins observing global surface air and sea temperatures, among other data. “The amount that we’re smashing records by is shocking,” Burgess said. After the cumulative warming of these past several months, it’s virtually guaranteed that 2023 will be the hottest year on record, according to Copernicus. Scientists monitorclimatevariables to gain an understanding of how our planet is evolving as a result of human-generated greenhouse gas emissions. A warmer planet means more extreme and intense weather events like severe drought orhurricanesthat hold more water, said Peter Schlosser, vice president and vice provost of the Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University. He is not involved with Copernicus. “This is a clear sign that we are going into a climate regime that will have more impact on more people,"" Schlosser said. “We better take this warning that we actually should have taken 50 years ago or more and draw the right conclusions.” Read more:Where We'll End Up Living as the Planet Burns This year has been so exceptionally hot in part because oceans have been warming, which means they are doing less to counteract global warming than in the past. Historically, the ocean has absorbed as much as 90% of the excess heat from climate change, Burgess said. And in the midst of an El Nino, a natural climate cycle that temporarily warms parts of the ocean and drives weather changes around the world, more warming can be expected in the coming months, she added. Schlosser said that means the world should expect more records to be broken as a result of that warming, but the question is whether they will come in smaller steps going forward. He added that the planet is already exceeding the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times that the Paris agreement was aimed at capping, and that the planet hasn't yet seen the full impact of that warming. Now, he, Burgess and other scientists say, the need for action — to stop planet-warming emissions — is urgent. “It's so much more expensive to keep burning these fossil fuels than it would be to stop doing it. That’s basically what it shows,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. “And of course, you don’t see that when you just look at the records being broken and not at the people and systems that are suffering, but that — that is what matters.” ___ AP Science Writer Seth Borenstein contributed to this report from Washington.","['germany', 'germany', 'mexico', 'france', 'unitedstates']",us,True,False

People have been urged to avoid alcohol and caffeine as the drinks could cause dehydration. The weather bureau says high temperatures are usual for October but are likely to become more frequent and severe because of climate change. Intense heatwaves also hit parts of North Africa, Europe, the US and Mexico in July. Experts say 2023 is likely to be the warmest year on record due to ongoing emissions of warming gases and El Niño weather events. In an advisory, Malawi's Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services said a ""prolonged period"" of hot and uncomfortable weather was expected to persist until Saturday. The projected maximum temperature in the southern Shire Valley is 44C and 40C in northern areas along Lake Malawi, it added. Malawi's chief meteorologist Yobu Kachiwanda told the BBC that a daily continuous rise in temperatures had culminated in a heatwave. ""The high temperatures are due to direct heat energy from the sun which is apparently overhead Malawi,"" Mr Kachiwanda said. The elderly, children and those with pre-existing health conditions are at risk of suffering serious health risks if exposed to extreme heat for a long period. ""Heat-related illnesses like heat exhaustion and heatstroke are a significant concern,"" the weather bureau said. Locals are advised to drink plenty of water throughout the day, even if they do not feel thirsty. They are also urged to wear light clothing, avoid intensive physical activities and use sunscreen to protect their skin from harmful sunlight. However, the high temperatures are essential to attract weather systems that generate the first rains in the country, the chief meteorologist said. Malawi is still recovering from a devastating tropical storm in March that killed more than 500 people. Tropical Storm Freddy saw mudslides sweep through neighbourhoods and bury people in mud. The storm also struck neighbouring Mozambique and Madagascar earlier that month, destroying scores of homes and triggering widespread floods. A study by World Weather Attribution group showed that global warming has exacerbated extreme weather in southern Africa.","['spain', 'us', 'mexico']",gb,False,False

FIFA had set a Tuesday deadline to submit a bid to host the tournament, but Australia's decision to pull out leaves Saudi Arabia asthe only declared candidate. “We have explored the opportunity to bid to host the FIFA World Cup and — having taken all factors into consideration — we have reached the conclusion not to do so for the 2034 competition,” Football Australia said in a statement. FIFA still needs to rubber stamp Saudi Arabia as the host — a decision that is likely to be made next year — but victory now seems a formality for the oil-rich kingdom. It would be the culmination of Saudi Arabia's ambitious drive to become a major player in global sports, having already spent massive amounts on bringing in dozens of star soccer players to its domestic league, buying English soccer club Newcastle, launching the breakaway LIV Golf tour and hosting major boxing fights. The sports spending program approved by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been described as sportswashing to soften a national image often associated with its record onwomen's rightsand the2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. FIFA president Gianni Infantino has built close ties to Saudi soccer and the crown prince personally, and has long been seen astrying to steer the world soccer body's competitionstoward the kingdom. Whenawarding the 2030 World Cupto a joint bid by Spain, Portugal and Morocco — which will also feature games in South America — FIFA decided to fast-track the 2034 hosting race earlier this month with only member federations in Asia and Oceania eligible to bid. The tight deadline gave them less than four weeks to enter the race by Tuesday and just one month more to sign a bidding agreement that requires government support. Within hours of the FIFA announcement, the Saudi soccer federation said it was in and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) — which includes Australia — said it was backing the kingdom to bring the World Cup back to the Middle East after neighboring Qatar hosted the 2022 edition. Qatar hosted in November and December, in the heart of the European club soccer season, to avoid extreme heat in the summer months and a Saudi tournament likely also will be moved from the traditional June-July period. Read More:Weary and Thirsty, World Cup Fans Try to Find Joy at a Complicated Tournament Indonesia’s football association initially showed interest in a joint bid with Australia, potentially alongside Malaysia and Singapore, butthat faded when Indonesia instead backed Saudi Arabia. Australia will instead attempt to secure hosting rights for the 2029 Club World Cup — which will relaunch with a new format in 2025, featuring 32 teams playing in the tournament every four years — and the 2026 Women’s Asian Cup. “We believe we are in a strong position to host the oldest women’s international competition in the world, the AFC Women’s Asian Cup 2026, and then welcome the greatest teams in world football for the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup,"" the FA statement said. Australia and New Zealand successfully co-hosted the Women's World Cup in July and August. Brisbane, Queensland state, is due to become the third Australian city to host the Olympics when it stages the 2032 Summer Games. Saudi Arabia also will host the men's Asian Cup in 2027 and has started a widespread construction program to build and renovate stadiums that likely also will be used for the World Cup. FIFA's bidding documents say 14 stadiums are needed for the 48-team tournament. After Qatar's World Cup was dogged by years-long allegations of rights abuses of migrant workers needed to build its stadiums, Saudi Arabia's hosting preparation will face some of the same scrutiny. Read More:Thousands of Migrant Workers Died in Qatar’s Extreme Heat. The World Cup Forced a Reckoning “With Saudi Arabia’s estimated 13.4 million migrant workers, inadequate labor and heat protections and no unions, no independent human rights monitors, and no press freedom, there is every reason to fear for the lives of those who would build and service stadiums, transit, hotels, and other hosting infrastructure in Saudi Arabia,” Human Rights Watch director of global initiatives Minky Worden said in a recent statement. “The possibility that FIFA could award Saudi Arabia the 2034 World Cup despite its appalling human rights record and closed door to any monitoring exposes FIFA’s commitments to human rights as a sham,” Worden said.","['saudiarabia', 'saudiarabia', 'saudiarabia', 'saudiarabia', 'saudiarabia', 'saudiarabia', 'saudiarabia', 'saudiarabia', 'saudiarabia', 'saudiarabia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'unitedkingdom', 'spain', 'portugal', 'morocco', 'qatar', 'qatar', 'qatar', 'qatar', 'canada', 'indonesia', 'indonesia', 'malaysia', 'singapore', 'newzealand']",us,False,False

Released every five years, the National Climate Assessment is a congressionally mandated evaluation of the effects of climate change on American life. This new fifth edition paints a picture of a nation simultaneously beset by climate-driven disasters and capable of dramatically reducing emissions of planet-warming gasses in the near future. This is the first time the assessment includes standalone chapters about climate change's toll on the American economy, as well as the complex social factors driving climate change and the nation's responses. And, unlike past installments, the new assessment draws heavily from social science, including history, sociology, philosophy and Indigenous studies. The new approach adds context and relevance to the assessment's robust scientific findings, and underscores the disproportionate danger that climate change poses to poor people, marginalized communities, older Americans and those who work outdoors. ""Climate change affects us all, but it doesn't affect us all equally,"" says climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, one of the authors of the assessment. But threaded throughout the report are case studies and research summaries highlighting ways ""climate action can create a more resilient and just country,"" she says. This is also the first time the National Climate Assessment will be translated into Spanish, although the Spanish-language version won't be available until the spring, according to the White House. The National Climate Assessment is extremely influential in legal and policy circles, and affects everything from court cases about who should foot the bill for wildfire damage, to local decisions about how tall to build coastal flood barriers. ""It really shapes the way that people understand, and therefore act, in relation to climate change,"" says Michael Burger, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. Hundreds of scientists from universities, industry, and federal agencies contributed to the report. They reviewed cutting-edge research published since the last report and contextualized it in decades of foundational climate research. The fifth edition of the assessment arrives as millions of Americans are struggling with the effects of a hotter Earth. Dramatic and deadly wildfires, floods and heat waves killed hundreds of people in the United States in 2023. And, while federal spending on renewable energy and disaster preparedness has increased, the U.S. is alsoinvesting in new fossil fuel infrastructurethat is not compatible with avoiding catastrophic warming later this century. Here are the three big takeaways from theFifth National Climate Assessment.

Chiu/APhide caption Windmills near Whitewater, Calif., in 2020. avoid billions of dollars of economic costs and help Americans live longer, healthier lives according to the Fifth National Climate Assessment. Food, housing, labor – it all gets pricier as the Earth heats up, according to the National Climate Assessment. Climate-driven weather disasters, like heat waves, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, are particularly expensive. They destroy homes and businesses, wreck crops and create supply shortages by delaying trucks, ships and trains. Such disasters make it more likely that families will go bankrupt, and that municipal governments will run deficits, the authors note. Weather-related disasters in the U.S. cause about $150 billion each year in direct losses, according to the report. That's a lot of money – roughly equal to the annual budget for the Energy Department – and it's only expected to go up as the Earth gets hotter. Loading... And that's all before factoring in the less obvious or tangible costs of climate change. For example, healthcare bills for people who are sicker because of extreme heat, or have respiratory illness brought on by breathing in mold after a flood. Exposure to wildfire smoke alone costs billions of dollars a year in lost earnings, the assessment notes – a burden that falls disproportionately on poor people who work outdoors. ""The research indicates that people who are lower income have more trouble adapting [to climate change], because adaptation comes at a cost,"" says Solomon Hsiang, a climate economist at the University of California, Berkeley and a lead author of the assessment. For example, one of the simplest ways to adapt to severe heat waves is to run your air conditioner more. But ""if people can't pay for it, then [they] can't protect themselves,"" explains Hsiang. And the hotter it gets, the more profound the economic harm, assessment warns. Twice as much planetary warming leads to more than twice as much economic harm, the assessment warns.

The latest National Climate Assessment underscores the many ways that climate change is already making Americans sick, and even killing them.Claire Harbage/NPRhide caption A roadside memorial to those who died in the wildfire that swept through the town of Lahaina, Hawaii in August. The latest National Climate Assessment underscores the many ways that climate change is already making Americans sick, and even killing them. Since the previous NCA was released five years ago, the health costs of climate change have gone from theoretical to personal for many Americans. The most obvious risk? Extreme weather, particularly heat, says Mary Hayden, the lead author of the chapter examining human health. Heat waves have become hotter, longer, and more dangerous, and they're hitting areas that aren't ready for them–like the ""record-shattering"" heat dome that descended on the Pacific Northwest in 2021 and caused hundreds of deaths. But it's not just heat. Wildfire smoke can send people thousands of miles from the fires to hospitals with respiratory problems and heart disease complications. Hurricanes can disrupt people's access to healthcare: when a clinic is flooded or people are displaced, for example,kidney patients can't get dialysis treatment. In most cases, the people who bear the brunt of the disasters are those already at risk: poor communities, communities of color, women, people with disabilities, and other marginalized groups. Temperatures in formerly redlined neighborhoods in cities across the country cansoar nearly 15 degrees Fahrenheit hotterthan wealthier areas just blocks away, putting residents at much higher risk of heat exposure. The assessment also homes in on research tracking less-obvious health impacts. Living through climate disasters, for example, can leave lasting emotional scars. ""We're not just talking about [people's] physical health–we're talking about their mental health. We're talking about their spiritual health. We're talking about the health and well-being of communities which are being affected by this,"" Hayden says. That means recognizing the long-term effects on communities like Paradise, California, where people still deal withdeep emotional traumafive years after their town burned in the 2018 Camp Fire. The report also flags the growing emotional toll on children and young people, for whom anxiety about the future of the planet is bleeding into all parts of their lives. A lobsterman paddles out to his boat in a harbor in Maine. Climate change is disrupting ways of living with, and from, the ocean.Ryan Kellmanhide caption The places, cultural practices, and traditions that anchor many communities are also in flux because of climate change. Fishing communities are seeing their livelihoods shift or collapse. The Northeast's iconic lobster fishery, the single most economically valuable in the country, haswithered as marine heatwaves sweep through the regional seas. Shrinking snowpack and too-warm temperatures are interrupting opportunities for beloved recreational activities,like skiing or ice fishing. Indigenous communities are being forced to adjust to new climate realities, which are disrupting traditional food-gathering traditions. In Palau, a monthly tradition of catching fish at a particularly low tide has been upset by sea level rise, which keeps water levels too high to trap fish in thehistorically-used places. Sea level rise is also forcing coastal communities tore-think their very existence,pulling apart the social fabric that has developed over generations. But many communities – Indigenous people, farmers and fishers, groups that have lived tightly connected to their environments for a long time – have deep stores of resilience from which to draw, says Elizabeth Marino, a sociologist and the lead author of the chapter on social transformations. ""There is quite a lot of wisdom in place to adapt to and even mitigate climate change,"" she says. ""It allows people to come up with solutions that fit the lives that they lead, and that's also a place of hope."" The fifth assessment lays out a stark picture of the climate challenges the U.S. faces. Keeping planetary warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the goal of the international Paris Agreement, will require immediate, enormous cuts to fossil fuel emissions in the U.S and beyond. Keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), an ambitious target written into the Agreement, will be even harder, the report says. But it also points out many successful efforts underway to adapt to the new reality and to prevent worse outcomes. ""It's not the message that if we don't hit 1.5 degrees, we're all going to die,"" says Hayhoe. ""It's the message that everything we do matters. Every 10th of a degree of warming we avoid, there's a benefit to that."" Addressing fossil fuel-driven climate change can also help people live healthier lives, stresses J. Jason West, the lead author on a chapter on air quality. Dialing back fossil fuel emissions would help prevent further climate change and also lessen the kinds of air pollution most harmful to human health."" There really is a lot of opportunity to take action that would resolve both of those problems at the same time,"" West says. There's been a subtle shift in the report's perspective since the last one, says Candis Callison, a sociologist and author of the report. There's now a clear acknowledgement, developed through years of rigorous research, that the fossil fuel-powered society the U.S. built over generations was profoundly unjust. Many pollution-producing coal or gas power plants weresited in communities of colorrather than white communities, affecting people's health outcomes for generations. And decisions about land and water use for energy extractionoften excluded tribal communities, with consequences still playing out today. The transition forward can look different, she says. ""Climate change actually provides us with an opportunity to address some of those inequities and injustices–and to respond to these impacts,"" Callison says. ""That's really a powerful thing.""","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'germany', 'palau']",us,True,True

The report issues a stark warning that extreme events and harmful impacts of climate change that Americans are already experiencing, such as heat waves, wildfires, and extreme rainfall, will worsen as temperatures continue to rise. The Fifth National Climate Assessment, issued every five years, is a definitive breakdown of the latest in climate science coming from 14 different federal agencies, including NOAA, NASA, the EPA, and the National Science Foundation. This year's report is more comprehensive than in previous because climate modeling has improved, and the authors took a more holistic look at physical and social impacts of climate change. ""We also have a much more comprehensive understanding of how climate change disproportionately affects those who've done the least to cause the problem,"" Katherine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and co-author of the report, said in a briefing with reporters. Some communities are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, the report says, warning that Black, Hispanic, and indigenous communities are more likely to face challenges accessing water as droughts become more intense. Climate change also creates more health risks for marginalized communities, according to the report, which says that “systemic racism and discrimination exacerbate” the impacts. The report lays out how every part of the US is being impacted by climate change and that some areas are facing multiple worsening impacts at the same time. For example, western states saw heat waves and wildfires during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which strained resources and added to the risk of severe illness. In the same year, back-to-back storms during the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season are some examples of climate-driven compounding events that caused unprecedented demand on federal emergency response resources. The report detailed some impacts of climate change that are being felt across the U.S., including increased risk of extreme heat and rainfall, among other weather-related events. Other impacts cited werecoastal erosionand threats to coastal communities from flooding; damage to land including wildfires anddamage to forests;warming oceans and damage to ecosystems likecoral reefs;risks from extreme events like fires; heatwaves and flooding, and increased inequality for minority orlow-income communities. Some areas of the U.S. are also seeing more specific impacts, such as more intense droughts in the Southwest. The assessment also notes changes in storm trends as a result of climate change. Heavy snowfall is becoming more common in the Northeast and hurricane trends are changing, with increases in North Atlantic hurricane activity and the intensification of tropical cyclones. 2023 was a record setting year forbillion-dollar climate disastersin the United States, officials noted in a White House briefing last week. The report also highlights some areas of success, saying more action has been taken across the board to reduce emissions and address climate change since the last report in 2018. Greenhouse gas emissions generated by the U.S. have been steadily decreasing since their peak in 2007, even as the energy demand goes up -- mainly due to a vast reduction in the use of coal, according to the report. Efforts to adapt to and respond to climate change need to be more ""transformative,"" the report found. This includes reducing the use of coal, building more wind turbines and electrifying buildings and making more efforts to protect people from the impacts of climate change. Individuals and government leaders should look at the report as a way to help communities across the country mitigate, adapt and become more resilient to the effects of climate change, White House Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi said. The assessment demonstrates ""both a real and profound environmental risk, but also a real and profound economic opportunity,"" Zaidi said. The administration has also noted that adding clean energy jobs is a top priority. The last time the National Climate Assessment was released, then-President Donald Trump said hedid not believe the findings. The 2018 report found that climate change could lead to massive economic loss, especially by vulnerable communities. In addition to theFifth National Climate Assessment, which is U.S.-focused, two global climate reports were also released on Tuesday, analyzing the current state of climate change policy action around the world. UN Climate Changereleased a progress report on climate action ahead of the COP28 conference set to kick off in Dubai on November 30th. The report highlights that progress on global climate action is moving too slow to keep up with the effects of global warming. ""The Global Stocktake report released by UN Climate Change this year clearly shows where progress is too slow. But it also lays out the vast array of tools and solutions put forward by countries. Billions of people expect to see their governments pick up this toolbox and put it to work,"" Simon Stiell, Executive-Secretary of UN Climate Change said. The 2023 State of Climate Actionreportwas also released on Tuesday, highlighting similar concerns that global climate action is not moving fast enough. ""In a year where climate change has been wreaking havoc across the world, it’s clear global efforts to curb emissions are falling short.""

TheNational Climate Assessment, which comes out every four to five years, was released Tuesday with details that bring climate change's impacts down to a local level. Overall, it paints a picture of a country warming about 60% faster than the world as a whole, one that regularly gets smacked with costly weather disasters and faces even bigger problems in the future. Since 1970, the Lower 48 states have warmed by 2.5 degrees (1.4 degrees Celsius) and Alaska has heated up by 4.2 degrees (2.3 degrees Celsius), compared to the global average of 1.7 degrees (0.9 degrees Celsius), the report said. But what people really feel is not the averages, but when weather is extreme. With heat waves, drought, wildfire and heavy downpours, “we are seeing an acceleration of the impacts of climate change in the United States,” said study co-author Zeke Hausfather of the tech company Stripe and Berkeley Earth. And that's not healthy. Climate change is ""harming physical, mental, spiritual, and community health and well-being through the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events, increasing cases of infectious and vector-borne diseases, and declines in food and water quality and security,"" the report said. Compared to earlier national assessments, this year’s uses far stronger language and “unequivocally” blames the burning of coal, oil and gas for climate change. Read more:How Psychology Can Help Fight Climate Change—And Climate Anxiety The 37-chapter assessment includes an interactive atlas that zooms down to the county level. It finds that climate change is affecting people’s security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority and Native American communities often disproportionately at risk. In Alaska, which is warming two to three times faster than the global average, reduced snowpack, shrinking glaciers, thawing permafrost, acidifying oceans and disappearing sea ice have affected everything from the state’s growing season, to hunting and fishing, with projections raising questions about whether some Indigenous communities should be relocated. The Southwest is experiencing more drought and extreme heat – including 31 consecutive days this summer whenPhoenix’s daily high temperaturesreached or exceeded 110 degrees – reducing water supplies and increasing wildfire risk. Northeastern cities are seeing more extreme heat, flooding and poor air quality, as well as risks to infrastructure, while drought and floods exacerbated by climate change threaten farming and ecosystems in rural areas. In the Midwest, both extreme drought and flooding threaten crops and animal production, which can affect the global food supply. In the northern Great Plains, weather extremes like drought and flooding, as well as declining water resources, threaten an economy dependent largely on crops, cattle, energy production and recreation. Meanwhile, water shortages in parts of the southern Great Plains are projected to worsen, while high temperatures are expected to break records in all three states by midcentury. In the Southeast, minority and Native American communities -- who may live in areas with higher exposures to extreme heat, pollution and flooding — have fewer resources to prepare for or to escape the effects of climate change. In the Northwest, hotter days and nights that don't cool down much have resulted in drier streams and less snowpack, leading to increased risk of drought and wildfires. The climate disturbance has also brought damaging extreme rain. Hawaii and other Pacific islands, as well as the U.S. Caribbean, are increasingly vulnerable to the extremes of drought and heavy rain as well as sea level rise and natural disaster as temperatures warm. Brown University climate scientist Kim Cobb, who wasn't part of the assessment team, said, “at the center of the report are people — across every region of the country - who have escalating risks associated with climate change as well as clear opportunities for win-win climate action.” The United States will warm in the future about 40% more than the world as a total, the assessment said. The AP calculated, usingothers'global projections, that would slate America to get about 3.8 degrees (2.1 degrees Celsius) hotter by the end of the century. Hotter average temperatures means weather that is even more extreme. “The news is not good, but it is also not surprising,” said University of Colorado's Waleed Abdalati, a former NASA chief scientist who was not part of this report. “What we are seeing is a manifestation of changes that were anticipated over the last few decades.” The 2,200-page report comes after five straight months when the globe set monthly and daily heat records. It comes as the U.S.has set a record with 25 different weatherdisasters this year that caused at least $1 billion in damage. “Climate change is finally moving from an abstract future issue to a present, concrete, relevant issue. It’s happening right now,” said report lead author Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy and a professor at Texas Tech University. Five years ago, when the last assessment was issued, fewer people were experiencing climate change firsthand. Surveys this year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research show that. In September, about 9 in 10 Americans (87%) said they'd experienced at least one extreme weather event in the past five years — drought, extreme heat, severe storms, wildfires or flooding. That was up from 79% who said that in April. Hayhoe said there's also a new emphasis in the assessment on marginalized communities. “It is less a matter ... of what hits where, but more what hits whom and how well those people can manage the impacts,” said University of Colorado's Abdalati, whose saw much of his neighborhood destroyed in the 2021 Marshall wildfire. Biden administration officials emphasize that all is not lost and the report details actions to reduce emissions and adapt to what's coming. Americans on every level of government are “stepping up to meet this moment,” said White House science adviser Arati Prabhakar. “All of these actions, taken together, give us hope because they tell us that we can do big things at the scale that’s required, at the scale that the climate actually notices.” By cleaning up industry, how electricity is made and how transport is powered, climate change can be dramatically reduced. Hausfather said when emissions stops, warming stops, ""so we can stop this acceleration if we as a society get our act together.” But some scientists said parts of the assessment are too optimistic. “The report's rosy graphics and outlook obscure the dangers approaching,” Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson said. “We are not prepared for what's coming.”","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'not found']",us,True,True

 / The most comprehensive national assessment… [+4730 chars]",Weather,"Climate disasters are costing the US billions of dollars a year, and the damage isn’t spread out evenly, according to a new national climate assessment. The assessment, produced about every four years, lays out the toll climate change is taking across every region in the United States. This is the fifth one — but for the first time, this year’s report includes chapters dedicated to economic impact and social inequities. As floods, fires, heatwaves, and other calamities tied to climate change intensify, households pay the price with higher costs and worsening environmental injustices. As floods, fires, heatwaves, and other calamities tied to climate change intensify, households pay the price with higher costs and worsening environmental injustices Climate change has created circumstances that the planet hasn’t seen for thousands of years, the report says. Global temperatures have risen faster over the past half-century than they have in at least 2,000 years. That’s led to all sorts of new threats, like the 2021 heatwave that killed more than 1,400 people in the typically temperate Pacific Northwest. And old problems get much bigger, like droughts sucking the Southwest dry. Drought in the Western US is currently more severe than it’s ever been in at least 1,200 years. Since 1980, drought and heatwaves alone have caused more than $320 billion in damages. Extreme weather disasters make up some of the most devastating displays of climate change and are becoming way more common — and more costly. Back in the 1980s, a billion-dollar disaster hit the US once every four months on average (a figure that’s adjusted for inflation). Now, the US has to cope with one every three weeks. Those extreme events come with $150 billion in losses every year, according to the assessment. That’s a “conservative estimate that does not account for loss of life, healthcare-related costs, or damages to ecosystem services,” the report says. Related We only get one planet Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm on cleaning up ‘clean’ energy There are also more insidious ways climate change takes a bite out of the US economy. Consumers have to shell out more money for food and other goods as prices reflect damages caused by climate change. In the Midwest, pests, diseases, and whiplash between wet and dry conditions linked to climate change threaten corn and apple harvests. And climate change has already supercharged 18 major fishery disasters in Alaska “that were especially damaging for coastal Indigenous Peoples, subsistence fishers, and rural communities,” according to the report. None of these challenges are happening in a vacuum. Like pollution, climate disasters disproportionately affect Americans of color, low-income households, and other groups that have been historically marginalized. While 20 to 40 percent of small businesses that shutter after a natural disaster never open their doors again, those owned by women, people of color, and veterans are even more likely to close for good. Flood losses are expected to balloon much faster in communities with a higher proportion of Black residents Flood losses are expected to balloon much faster in communities with a higher proportion of Black residents. Census tracts where at least 20 percent of the population is Black are projected to see average annual losses from floods rise at a rate twice as fast as other census tracks where less than 1 percent of the population is Black. It’s partly a symptom of racist housing policies like redlining that have left certain communities without the infrastructure and resources to cope with hazards brought on by climate change. Formerly redlined neighborhoods can also be around 12 degrees hotter than surrounding areas because of fewer green spaces and more paved surfaces that trap heat. All of these risks grow as long as the US, the world’s biggest oil and gas producer, and other countries keep running on fossil fuels. The world has warmed by a little more than 1 degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution, and the report says 2 degrees of warming would more than double the economic toll from climate change. The US isn’t taking action fast enough to stop that outcome, the report shows. Planet-heating pollution in the US has only fallen by an average of about 1 percent annually since 2005. It needs to drop by more than 6 percent per year to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which commits countries to keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.

Considering the predicted outcome of burning fossil fuels, our best and only plan to limit warming is to reduce CO2emissions from human activities to ""net zero""—where the amount of CO2we emit into the atmosphere is equal to the amount we remove from it. To keep within the 1.5°C limit of the 2015 Paris Agreement, this must happen as soon as possible.Though the scientific community's current best estimate from models is thatglobal warmingwill stop at net zero, an article published inFrontiers in Scienceraises a red flag.""These estimates come with substantial uncertainty, meaning there is a non-negligible chance that global warming will continue after net zero and intensify dangerous climate change,"" said Prof Joeri Rogelj at Imperial College London and one of the international team of authors. ""Worldwide emissions reduction plans overlook this important risk, which should be urgently addressed at COP28.""The article presents the first comprehensive analysis of the many factors controllingglobal temperaturesand provides a framework for improving warming predictions. ""Our analysis identifies the levers of global warming after net zero, and explains why current estimates are so uncertain,"" said lead author Sofia Palazzo Corner, also of Imperial College London.""The potential of future climate risks in a net zero world makes the need to limit our initial disturbance to the planet even more imperative,"" she added. ""Crucially for policy, a world that expects warming to continue after net zero will have an even smaller carbon budget to keep total warming below 1.5°C.""Prof Michael Mann at the University of Pennsylvania said that despite its alarming message on the prospect of continued global warming, this study offers hope. ""It reminds us that the obstacles toclimate actionare neither physical nor technological. At this point, they remain political. And history teaches us that political obstacles can be overcome,"" he wrote in an editorial accompanying the article, also published inFrontiers in Science.Our remaining carbon budget may be smaller than we think. Credit: Palazzo Corner et al/FrontiersWhy would global warming continue in a net zero world?Global temperatures are regulated by multiple natural processes and feedbacks in the oceans, land, and atmosphere. CO2emissions have influenced many of these, triggering long-term changes which could last for centuries after net zero is reached.""The melting of ice inpolar regionsis one example,"" explained Prof Martin Siegert of the University of Exeter, another of the study's authors. ""As we have observed in the Arctic Ocean, andrecently in the Antarctic, athin layerof floating ice helps reduce global temperatures by reflecting the sun's energy back into space. However, once this ice melts this reflection is replaced by absorption of solar energy, which drives temperatures even higher.""Even current climate models show these processes could cause significant warming after net zero—with an estimated 1 in 6 chance this warming could exceed 15% of total global warming. This means that if global temperatures have risen by 2°C at the point we reach net zero, the final temperature change could be above 2.3°C.""Warming of this magnitude would worsen major climate risks to communities across the world, and particularly in the most vulnerable regions,"" said Siegert.The Earth will continue changing even if global warming stops. Credit: Palazzo Corner et al/FrontiersToward a better understanding of future global warming riskDespite persistent progress in the field, exploring the full range of climate change risks is challenging. Models are already very expensive to run and every added process further increases the computational burden.""We need acollaborative effortbetween diverse climate experts to develop a suite of scientific tools that allow us to more deeply explore and understand the level of global warming we can expect. Our study takes the first step by mapping all processes that affect global temperatures and estimating their impact across millennia,"" said Rogelj.The international team—which additionally includes researchers from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Melbourne University, and the Max Plank Institute—identified 26 distinct processes, of which more than half could drive significant warming.One example is a decline in land carbon uptake. Plants are important mitigators of global temperatures since they use CO2during photosynthesis. But other climate processes, such as changing rainfall patterns, droughts, and heat waves, can reduce the efficacy of this ""carbon sink.""""We have drawn on expertise across climate science to build a catalog of processes that could affect global temperatures in a net zero world, but we need to better understand their potential impact. We propose a set of key research activities to reduce this uncertainty and improve warming predictions as quickly as possible,"" said Palazzo Corner.Next steps to understand future global warming risk. Credit: Palazzo Corner et al/FrontiersWe must reach net zero CO2as soon as possibleThe study's take-home message is that the future is more uncertain than we think, and so we must adjust our climate mitigation policies to prevent further warming after net zero.""We are working on building better models, but should not wait until they are perfect before we act. We must take a precautionary approach and drastically reduce emissions now with the goal of achieving net zero CO2as soon as possible and preventing climate harm to future generations,"" warned Rogelj.""Even if global warming did stop at net zero, we must remember that once started, some processes will continue for centuries,"" Siegert added. ""Sea-level rise for decades after net zero is an example we must plan for, but there may be others that require further analysis. By urgently cutting emissions we can prevent future risks.""The article is part of theFrontiers in Sciencemultimedia article hub ""Global warming after net zero CO2.""

Rio de Janeiro recorded 42.5C on Sunday - a record for November - and high humidity on Tuesday meant that it felt like 58.5C, municipal authorities said. More than a hundred million people have been affected by the heat, which is expected to last until at least Friday. Officials have attributed it to the El Niño phenomenon and climate change. The city of São Paulo saw average temperatures of 37.3C on Tuesday afternoon, the National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet) reported. ""I'm exhausted, it's hard,"" Riquelme da Silva, 22, told AFP news agency on the streets there. ""When I get home, it's cold water, otherwise I can't even get up because I'm so tired. It's even hard to sleep."" Dora, a 60-year-old street vendor, described the heat as ""unbearable"" for those who worked outside. Inmet has issued red alerts for a large part of the country. These indicate that temperatures may be 5C above average for longer than five days and could pose a serious danger to health.

More than a hundred million people have been affected by the heat, which is expected to last until at least Friday. Officials have attributed it to the El Niño phenomenon and climate change. The city of São Paulo saw average temperatures of 37.3C on Tuesday afternoon, the National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet) reported.

Since 2018, cities in every region have ramped up their efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change.Still, the effects of climate change that are being experienced already today—more damaging storms, deadly heat waves and floods—are ""likely unprecedented over thousands of years."" They are touching everything, fromeconomic securitytohuman health, with underserved communities often harmed the most. And while no part of the country has been unscathed, few are as vulnerable to the worsening effects as the Southeast.Those are among the main findings from the Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5), a sweeping federalreportthat provides a comprehensive look at how the country is being affected by climate change and what it is doing to respond.Katherine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and one of the authors of the assessment, said ""too many people still think of climate change as an issue that's distant from us in space or time or relevance.""""[The report] shows us how—if we live in the U.S.—the risks matter, and so to do our choices,"" Hayhoe added.More than 500 authors and 260 contributors worked on this edition, including several from Georgia. The last report was released in 2018 during the Trump administration, but much has changed since then.In 2021, under President Joe Biden's administration, the U.S. re-entered the Paris Climate Agreement, the international pact that seeks to limit global warming. With the votes of Democrats in Congress, Biden also passed his signature climate and health care law—the Inflation Reduction Act—which offers billions in tax credits and incentives to help the U.S. transition toclean energy, plus funding to help communities adapt.Here's what the report says about how Georgia is faring as the planet heats up.Dangerous heat on the riseAtlanta now sees around eight more extreme heat days that it did 1961, according to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which oversaw the assessment. The city's ""heat wave season"" has also lengthened by more than 80 days.And while scientists have long known that emissions of greenhouse gases are increasing the intensity and frequency of heat waves, the report finds the Southeast is among the most vulnerable regions to these events.Underlying health issues like diabetes and heart disease are known to increase vulnerability to heat illness, and the assessment notes Southerners consistently rank among the most unhealthy in the country, with shorter-than-average life expectancies. The Southeast is also home to more Black residents than any other region of the country who ""shoulder a disproportionate level of health risk associated with climate change.""While the region has not seen a jump in days over 95 degrees like other parts of the country, it has seen an increase in nighttime temperatures. On average, the Southeast now sees almost eight more days with overnight temperatures above 70 degrees than it did between 1901 and 1960, the report found.High overnight temperatures rob the body of the cooling-off period it needs to stay safe during the day, with those living in poorly insulated homes or unhoused facing the greatest risk. Adding to the problem in heavily paved cities like Atlanta areurban heat islands, which can be as much as 12 degrees warmer than surrounding areas in a heat wave, the authors write.Evan Mallen, a senior analyst at Georgia Tech's Urban Climate Lab and a technical contributor to the assessment, said the report makes clear that heat does not affect everyone equally.""I think that when it comes to both the city and the state, we should be thinking about how we address these challenges in a way that is equitable,"" he said.More flooding on the coast—and inlandAs Earth's glaciers and ice sheets melt, the report findssea level riseis accelerating on Georgia's 100-mile-long coast and elsewhere in the Southeast.Though exact amounts vary by location, tide gauges along the Southeast coast show sea levels rose by roughly six inches between 1970 and 2020, the report finds, with a significant uptick in just the last three decades. Parts of the Southeast could face sea levels that are 16 to 23 inches higher than they were in 2000 by 2050, less than 30 years from now.As a result, the report says high-tide flooding events could become five to 10 times more common than they are today, threatening to coastal communities.Areas farther inland face a growing flood risk, too.Heavy deluges are occurring more frequently and becoming more intense, the assessment found. In the Southeast, the heaviest 1% of precipitation events now dump 37% more rain than they did in the middle of the 20th century. Only the Northeast and Midwest have seen larger increases.Those events can quickly overwhelm urban stormwater systems, just as one did in Atlanta in September, causing damaging flooding in parts of downtown.Warmer winters, failing cropsFarming is the lifeblood of many rural communities and an economic driver in Georgia, worth an estimated $74 billion of total economic impact each year.But farmers in Georgia are already having trouble bringing their crops to harvest. An exceptionally warm winter followed by a March freeze wiped out nearly all of the state's peach crop this year, and blueberry farmers have endured similar losses. Then, just over two months ago, Hurricane Idalia downed tens of thousands of pecan trees in South Georgia.Those problems—and others—are likely to grow as the planet warms, the assessment found.The report says higher temperatures, especially overnight, are already reducing farmers' yields, with impacts set to worsen as the heat increases. Long-term droughts are expected to grow more intense, and warmer conditions will allow pests to invade new areas.Pam Knox, an agricultural climatologist at UGA and one of the authors of the Southeast chapter of the report, said there is reason for hope that farmers can adjust to the changes. Modern techniques like precision farming—data-driven technologies that help farmers to use resources, like water and fertilizer, as efficiently as possible—are catching on and growing cheaper.""The more we know, the more we can figure out ways to adapt and change our management style to deal with a challenge,"" Knox said.'Hope and possibilities' existThe report does not mince words: There is not a pocket of the U.S. that has been left untouched by climate change, and the effects are likely to get worse. But how much worse depends on the actions we take today, the authors write.There are promising signs that the country and the rest of the world are making progress in the fight to reduce emissions.The price of solar panels has dropped 90% since 2010, while other clean energy technologies—from batteries to wind turbines—have gotten cheaper, too. Local efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt toclimate changeare taking place in every part of the country and have increased substantially since the last national assessment in 2018.Plus, the technologies needed to decarbonize the economy—fromelectric vehiclesandsolar powerto energy-efficient appliances and techniques to reduce food waste—already exist. With EV, battery and solar plants coming online in Georgia, the state is set to play a major role in providing those technologies to the U.S. and global markets.""The takeaway from this assessment—the takeaway from all of our collective work onclimate—should not be doom and despair,"" said Ali Zaidi, the White House's National Climate Advisor. ""The takeaway should be a sense of hope and possibilities.""2023 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Against this backdrop of climate inaction, the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change in its eighth annual global report projects heat-related labour loss might increase by 50 per cent. Heatwaves alone could lead to 524.9 million additional people experiencing moderate-to-severe food insecurity by 2041-60, aggravating the global risk of malnutrition, it said. The report further projects an increased spread of life-threatening infectious diseases by mid-century, with the length of coastline suitable for Vibrio pathogens expanding by 17-25 per cent, and the transmission potential for dengue increasing by 36-37 per cent. Vibrio pathogens are responsible for food-borne diseases such as cholera. The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change is an international, multidisciplinary collaboration and is published yearly, according to the British journal's website. The collaboration monitors the ""evolving health profile of climate change"" and provides an ""independent assessment of the delivery of commitments made by governments worldwide under the Paris Agreement"", the website says. Climate inaction is costing lives and livelihoods today and the new global projections reveal the grave and mounting threat to health of further delayed action on climate change, the 2023 report said. With 1,337 tonnes of CO2 emitted every second, each moment of delay worsens the risks to people's health and survival, it said. The projections are an indication of what the future looks like because as ""risks rise, so will the costs and challenges of adaptation,"" according to the report, which drew on the expertise of 114 scientists and health practitioners from 52 research institutions and UN agencies worldwide. The analysis showed that of the total days reaching health-threatening high temperatures in 2020, human-caused climate change made over 60 per cent of them more than twice as likely to occur. Further, heat-related deaths in people older than 65 years increased by 85 per cent compared with 1990-2000, the analysis found. The report said that this was ""substantially higher than the 38 per cent increase that would have been expected had temperatures not changed"". Despite such instances, the 2023 report found that the world is ""often moving in the wrong direction"", even as the 2022 Lancet Countdown report highlighted an ""opportunity to accelerate the transition away from health-harming fossil fuels in response to the global energy crisis"". The latest report found that oil and gas companies are further reducing their compliance with the Paris Agreement, driven in part by record profits. As of early 2023, the strategies of the world's 20 largest oil and gas companies will result in emissions surpassing levels consistent with the Paris Agreement goals by 173 per cent in 2040, an increase of 61 per cent from 2022, the report predicted. Meanwhile, global fossil fuel investment increased by 10 per cent in 2022, reaching over USD 1 trillion, with oil and gas extractive activities being supported through both private and public financial flows, the report found. With little progress in transitioning to clean energy, the persistent use and expansion of fossil fuels will ensure an increasingly inequitable future that threatens the lives of billions of people alive today, it said. Only 2.3 per cent of electricity in low Human Development Index (HDI) countries comes from modern renewables, against 11 per cent in very high HDI countries, the report said, attributing this to structural global inequities in the development of, access to, and use of clean energy. It further said that 92 per cent of households in low HDI countries still relied on biomass fuels to meet their energy needs, against 7.5 per cent in very high HDI countries and that deaths had increased in medium HDI countries, where access to non-polluting energy and air quality control measures were lagging. In the 62-country analyses that included India, the report found household air pollution to result in 140 deaths per 1,00,000 in 2020. In this context, the transition to renewables can enable access to decentralised clean energy, which could help avoid deaths due to exposure to dirty-fuel-derived, outdoor, airborne, fine particulate matter pollution as well as indoor air pollution, the report said. The report acknowledged that scientific understanding of the links between health and climate change is rapidly growing. Also, the health dimensions of climate change are increasingly acknowledged in the public discourse, with 24 per cent of all climate change newspaper articles in 2022 referring to health, the report said, adding that these trends ""signal what could be the start of a life-saving transition."" The report, however, found few signs of the urgently needed progress, in a world still bound to fossil fuel ambitions and thus, called for ""a people-centred transformation: putting health at the heart of climate action"". The pace and scale of mitigation efforts continued to fall very far short of those required to safeguard people's safety, with current policies putting the world on track for a potentially catastrophic 2.7 degrees Celsius of heating by 2100, the report warned. Revealing a way forward to a healthy future, the report suggested ""redirecting subsidies, lending, investment, and other financial flows away from fossil fuels"". Health-centred urban redesign can promote safe active travel, reduce building and transport-based air pollution and emissions, and increase resilience to climate hazards, it said. Increasing urban green spaces can also offer local cooling, increase carbon sequestration, and provide direct benefits to physical and mental health, it said. With climate change claiming millions of lives annually and its threats rapidly growing, seizing the opportunity to secure a healthier future has never been more vital, it said. Ensuring that a thriving future remains within reach will require coordinated action and a ""science-driven approach"" of health professionals, policymakers, corporations, and financial institutions, the report concluded.

The projection comes as heat-related deaths of adults over 65 have increased by 85% since the 1990s, according to the annualLancet Countdown on Health and Climate Changereport. The hottest global temperatures in over 100,000 years were recorded in 2023 with the planet currently at 1.14°C of global heating, the report says. Increasing global temperatures are linked to environmental changes like melting Arctic ice caps, drought and heat waves, and more intense hurricanes and wildfires. These stark changes are more than just ecological concerns; they also significantly impact human health, the report stressed. This new Lancet report comes the same day asthe new White House climate report, which flagged that climate-related hazards such as extreme heat, drought, and wildfires will continue to grow and directly impact human health. There were on average 86 days of health-threatening high temperatures in 2018-2022, according to the Lancet report. Human-caused climate change made more than 60% of those days more likely to have happened, the analysis showed. ""We're already seeing climate change claiming lives or livelihoods in every part of the world. The impacts are happening here and now,"" said Marina Romanello, the executive director of the Lancet Countdown and a climate change and health researcher at University College London, during a press briefing. Droughts and heatwaves are increasing globally, leading to food insecurity and water scarcity, according to the researchers. There has been a 29% increase in areas of extreme drought since the 1950s. Around 127 million more people said that they experienced significant food insecurity in 2021 than annually between 1981 and 2010. The report also warned that warming ocean temperatures are enabling the spread of the Vibrio bacteria, which can cause serious illness and death if people swim in water with open wounds or eat raw or contaminated seafood. The coastline area suitable for Vibrio bacteria around the world has increased every year by 329 square kilometers since 1982, putting around 1.4 billion more people at risk of diarrheal disease, severe wound infections and sepsis by 2022. ""Climate breakdown has begun, and humanity is staring down the barrel of an intolerable future. We are already seeing a human catastrophe unfolding with the health and livelihoods of billions across the world endangered by record-breaking heat, crop-failing droughts, rising levels of hunger, growing infectious disease outbreaks, and deadly storms and floods,"" said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres in response to the Lancet report. The Paris Agreement, the international treaty on climate change, calls for the world to keep global warming to well below 2-degrees Celsius, with the aim of limiting the increase to 1.5-degrees Celsius. The new report found that under the 2-degree warming scenario, there would be 525 million additional people experiencing significant food insecurity by 2031-2060. There would be 23–39% more cases of infection with Vibrio bacteria under the 2-degree warming scenario. There would also be a 37% increase in the spread of dengue, a mosquito-borne illness that can be life threatening, the report says. ""Continued warming could lead to those patterns spiraling out of control,"" Romanello said to the projections outlined in the report.

The work appears in theJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres.""Even if the world meets the ambitious target of limitingglobal warmingto 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels—which we are not on track to do—we are going to see significant sea-level rise,"" said Paul Goddard, an assistant research scientist in the IU College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and the lead author of the study.""Exploring ways to reflect sunlight into space before it is absorbed into Earth's climate system could help buy us more time to address climate change and avoid or delay climate tipping points, such as collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.""In addition to Goddard, co-authors on the paper include IU Earth and atmospheric sciences assistant professor Ben Kravitz; Douglas MacMartin and Daniele Visioni of Cornell University; Ewa Bednarz with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and Walker Lee of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.The study explored a form of climate engineering called stratospheric aerosol injection, in which large amounts of tiny sulfur droplets are released into the stratosphere by a fleet of airplanes as a proposed method for keepingglobal temperaturesin check.The approach mimics what happens when a large volcano spews vast amounts of particles into the upper atmosphere and precipitates acooling effectthat can last months to years. It was recently discussed in aWhite House reportoutlining a potential research program on stratospheric aerosol injection and marine cloud brightening, another proposed strategy for cooling the planet.Ten of the hottest years on record have occurred in the last 14 years. That's including 2023, which is on track to supplant 2016 as the hottest year ever recorded. The spike in global temperatures has coincided with unprecedented heat waves, wildfires, flash flooding, and other climate-related impacts around the world.In their study, IU researchers and collaborators used high-performance computers and global climate models to simulate different stratospheric aerosol injection scenarios, identifying the cooling strategy with the most potential to slow Antarctic ice loss. A portion of the data analysis conducted for the study took place on IU University Information Technology Services' large-memory computer cluster,Carbonate.""Where you release the aerosols matters a lot and can affect the climate differently,"" Goddard said. ""In this case, we found that releasing stratospheric aerosols at multiple latitudes within the tropics and sub-tropics, with a greater proportion in the Southern Hemisphere, is the best strategy for preserving land ice in Antarctica because it helps keep warm ocean waters away from the ice shelves.""Researchers simulated 11 different stratospheric aerosol injection scenarios. Three cases spanned multiple latitudes—considered the most likely approach for how stratospheric aerosols injection might be implemented—with temperature targets of 1.5, 1 and 0.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The simulations, which started in 2035 and ran through 2070, included a moderate emissions scenario with no stratospheric aerosol injection that served as a key point of comparison.Though simulated scenarios with stratospheric aerosol injection at multiple latitudes showed benefits in terms of Antarctic ice loss, further study is needed to quantify the change in melt rates, Goddard said.Notably, several single-latitude injection scenarios actually accelerated Antarcticice lossdue to a southward shift of prevailing winds drawing warm ocean waters toward the ice shelves.""If we're ever going to engineer the climate, how we do it really matters,"" Goddard said.Some of the risks related to stratosphericaerosolinjection, for example, include changes in regional precipitation patterns and the possibility of ""termination shock,"" a rapid rebound of global temperatures to pre-stratospheric aerosols injection levels should the decades-long treatment be interrupted.The study adds to an expanding body of knowledge about the benefits and drawbacks of deliberately cooling the planet, a concept that is being discussed more widely as the effects of climate change become more prominent, Kravitz said.""If society decides it wants to do geoengineering someday, we need to better understand what we know and what we don't know,"" he said.""We're starting to fill some of these knowledge gaps on the risks and regional effects of managingsolar radiation, but there's a lot more research that needs to be done before anyone can say whether it's a good idea to actually move forward with it. That's true as much for Antarctica as it is for the rest of the planet.""",[],gb,False,False

Individuals and entities ranging from the former prime minister of Grenada (a cricket-loving nation) to the Royal Challengers Bangalore of the Indian Premier League (who donned green jerseys in 2022 to bring attention to scorching temperatures) have called attention to cricket’s climate crisis and called for action. Playing the game in the warming climate inhibits safety and productivity — similar to other jobs. One Day Internationals, or ODIs, the form of cricket played during the World Cup, can last up to eight hours. In India, temperatures during the latter part of the game’s season can exceed 100 degrees, and — over even short periods — heighten the risk of heat stroke and other ailments. Cricket batsmen encased in helmets and padding are at even greater risk. Meanwhile, greater levels of precipitation and other extreme weather events are wreaking other sorts of havoc.

But the shift brings another danger that is especially deadly for nestlings: greater exposure to temperature variability in the form of cold snaps and heat waves. Such extremes result in more nest failures. These findings come from a Cornell Lab of Ornithology study just published in the journalNature Communications.""When we talk about temperature changes, the focus is mostly on averages,"" said co-lead author Conor Taff, a researcher in Cornell University's Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department.""But all creatures, including humans, interact withweather conditionsright in the moment, not with long-term averages. Even a one or two-day period when it's really cold or really hot can be incredibly challenging even if the average temperature hasn't changed. Changing temperature averages and temperature variability are two different components ofclimate change.""To understand howtemperature variabilitymight affect nesting success, the researchers analyzed 300,000 breeding bird records submitted to the Cornell Lab's NestWatch project between 1995 and 2020. They pinpointed the coldest three-day day period and the hottest three-day period for each one of the nests and then looked at whether those values predicted lower nesting success. Success was measured by how many nestlings survived to fledge.""We found that 16 of the 24 species we studied had reduced reproductive success when a cold snap occurred during the incubation or nestling stages,"" Taff said. ""Eleven of 24 had reduced success when a heat wave occurred during the breeding season. Aerial insectivores were the most sensitive totemperature extremes, especially cold.""Eastern Bluebird feeding chicks. Credit: Nancy Miller, Cornell Lab of Ornithology.The vast majority of birds feed insects to their young, regardless of their final diet, and cold snaps reduce insect availability. If these episodes occur when nestlings are most vulnerable, they can trigger a mass die-off. During a cold snap, adult birds may move away to find survivable conditions which leaves eggs and nestlings exposed to cold and lack of food.""It's the nestlings that really get hit hard because they can't regulate their own body temperature yet,"" said co-author Ryan Shipley, a Cornell University Ph.D. student at the time of the research. ""Nestlings also grow at an exponential rate during the first week or two of life and if insect activity drops because of a cold snap, theyoung birdslikely won't survive.""Taff and Shipley also examined 100 years of weather data to see if there have been changes in the timing of cold snaps andheat wavesduring the March through August breeding season in the United States and Canada. Although they found no clear pattern in the timing of temperature extremes, they do note that it's getting warmer everywhere.Tree Swallow feeding insects to chick. Credit: Brian E. Kushner, Cornell Lab of Ornithology.""Even if nestlings somehow manage to survive acold snapor heat wave, there may still be long-term consequences affecting the overall health of the birds,"" notes Shipley. ""We're only looking at a brief snapshot duringearly lifeand cannot measure long-term health in an unbanded wild population.""Previous Tree Swallow studies by these authors have shown that temperature during development is important because it's directly linked to the rate of nestling growth and their body mass when they fledge. That, in turn, influences how likely they are to survive, make it through migration, and return to breed the following year. Therefore, changes in the variability and timing of temperature extremes and shifts in thebreeding seasoncan combine to bring about life-changing consequences for individuals and for bird populations.","['unitedstates', 'canada']",gb,False,False

The WMO will finally confirm this in its provisional State of the Global Climate 2023 report, which will be released on November 30 - the opening day of the 28th session of the UN Climate Change conference ( COP28 ) - in Dubai. It posted the NOAA’s findings on micro-blogging site ‘X’ late Wednesday night. Using several international datasets, the global Met body had last week said that it was by far the warmest October on record, 0.85 degree Celsius above the 1991-2020 average, and 0.40 degree C above the previous warmest October. “For the calendar year to date, January to October , the global mean temperature for 2023 is the highest on record, 1.43 degree C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, and 0.10 degree C higher than the ten-month average for 2016 (the warmest year on record, so far),” it said. Referring to average temperature in October which was ranked as the warmest October in the 174-year global climate record, the NOAA on Wednesday said, “Last month was also 2023’s fifth month in a row of record-warm global temperatures... The average global temperature for October was 1.34 degrees C above the 20th-century average of 14 degrees C.” A report from WMO and the UK’s Met Office had predicted in May that there is a 98% likelihood that at least one of the next five years will be the warmest on record and a 66% chance of temporarily exceeding 1.5 degree C above the 1850-1900 average (safe warming limit under the Paris Agreement) for at least one of the five years. “This does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5 degree C level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years,” said WMO while bringing clarity on the monthly average global temperature rise. Looking regionally, the NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information on Wednesday underlined that Asia and South America had their warmest Octobers on record, while Africa, Europe and North America each had their second-warmest Octobers.

<ul><li>Urban waterfronts are neglected in many Am… [+9029 chars]",News,"On a sunny, 80-degree Saturday afternoon in late October, Mia Olis left her home in Chelsea to soak up the rays on Manhattan's brand-new — and so far only — public beach. Raised in Hawaii, Olis loves the water and surfing. But Rockaway Beach — more than an hour away by subway — was too far a trek that day. The 1,200 tons of sand near Greenwich Village along the Hudson river would have to do. ""I love that everybody's here,"" Olis, a 40-year-old lawyer, said while perched on a towel in a bikini. But she noted the park sits in a ritzy neighborhood, and thought it felt a little exclusive. ""I wish it were more accessible to everybody else from uptown, Harlem, the Bronx."" Still, she said, any new green space in New York is cause for celebration. Urban waterways can be a huge asset to cities and their residents. Rivers, lakes, canals, and ocean beaches can attract new residents, visitors, and commercial development. If they're well-designed, they can make cities more inclusive and help protect them from storms and heatwaves. Waterfronts are also just nice places to be. People are naturally drawn to them, as manya poetand sociologist has pointed out. And they'll alsopay a premium to live by them. Economists say cities with struggling downtowns should invest in their green space — and that includes opening up waterfronts. ""Places that have better natural amenities — they tend to do better. They attract more people, they attract more jobs, they have higher economic growth,"" said Amanda Weinstein, a professor of economics at the University of Akron. But they have to be made accessible. ""It's the investment in that natural amenity that matters."" While the breeze off the Hudson offered some respite on that unusually warm fall day, a dip in the water would've been an even better way to cool off. But there's no public pool nearby, andno sanctioned river swim spotsin the city. Even if the Hudsonwas consistently clean enough to swim in, it would take a lot to convince many New Yorkers to dive in. ""It would be a really big leap for me to swim in it,"" said Karin Balow, a 58-year-old Inwood resident who grew up along the river upstate. She traveled from her Upper Manhattan home to check out the new beach, where she settled into an Adirondack chair with a book. ""But it has come a long, long way. So who knows?"" New York City has done a lot to invest in its 520 miles of waterfront. The sandy bluff on Gansevoort peninsula is part of the much larger Hudson River park and looks out over Little Island,a whimsical, highly instagrammable transformationof Pier 55. Hoards of people crowded the winding, tree-lined paths up to the island's breezy observation deck on that October day. If they read the signage, they'd know the city's garbage used to be incinerated where they stood. The park — the borough's second-largest — is credited withhelping revitalize Manhattan's west side. Over the last couple of decades, New York has built a series of iconic waterfront parks on former industrial sites like Brooklyn Bridge Park and Domino Park in Brooklyn, Battery Park and the East River park in Manhattan, and Gantry State Plaza Park and Astoria Park in Queens. Governor's island now features manmade hills with sweeping skyline views, urban farming, and glamping. And the East River might soon geta massive floating pool. Cities across the country are increasingly looking to transform their neglected waterfronts in an effort to bring people back downtown. Cleveland, Ohio, isworking on a planfor a new beach, housing, and park space on the shores of Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River. Seattle has torn down an elevated freeway downtown to make way for a waterfront park. A couple hundred miles south of Manhattan, the waters off the shores of the nation's capital are also finding new life. In recent years, DC has opened up its waterfront,transforming the southwestwith the glitzy Wharf — featuring luxury condos, restaurants, music venues, and a soccer stadium, and redeveloping the Capitol riverfrontfrom Navy Yardto Buzzard Point with the Nationals baseball stadium and tons of new housing. The city just recently finished its decade-long construction of two major tunnels that capture stormwater, preventingalmost all sewage from overflowinginto the Anacostia river during storms and easing flooding in low-lying neighborhoods. For the first time in over a half century, the city is planning to open the Anacostia river next June for a sanctioned swimming event. The splash event was supposed to happen in July, and then September of this year, but was postponed twice due to severe storms. Urban waterways like the Hudson and Anacostia pose aserious flooding threatto cities as climate change triggers rising sea levels and more ferocious storms. Waterfront parks can helpin collecting storm surge and rainwater and preventing flooding. They can also offer respite as summers get hotter. Cities — built of heat-absorbing asphalt and concrete, instead of cooling greenery —make heatwaves even worse. International climate experts warn heat-related deaths globallycould more than quadrupleby mid-century if the planet heats up to 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels. A cool breeze off a river or lake, or a dip in one, could save lives. ""There is a very real need in cities,"" said Trey Sherard, the riverkeeper at the DC non-profit Anacostia Riverkeeper, which is organizing the June swim event. ""It's not just recreation, it's public health to be able to cool off that way."" Climate resilience is also key to building more equitable cities. Communities of color and lower-income neighborhoods across the countryare disproportionately impactedby environmental impacts, like flooding and extreme heat.In the DC area, the vast majority of homes most vulnerable to floodingare in Ward 7 and Prince George's County, Maryland, both of which are majority Black. VIDEO: Thousands of people take to the beaches of Rio de Janeiro to cool off as a heatwave strikes parts of Brazil in the middle of spring. According to the Alerta Rio system, the maximum temperature recorded on Sunday was 42.5 degrees Celsius in Iraja.pic.twitter.com/vVJ9elwcss There are also historic inequities when it comes to swimming. Public pools across the country were largely racially segregated until the 1950s — and after that, manyprivate poolsopened to cater to white people fleeing desegregation. Without safe and clean rivers and lakes to turn to, Black communities across the country often didn't have anywhere to take a dip or teach their kids to swim. DC's Black communities still face many of these challenges. The free swimming lessons that the city department of parks and recreation offers can't meet the high demand and don't cater to adults. ""There's a lot of water fear in DC, especially east of the river. And that speaks to generations being separated from their waterways,"" Sherard said. Sherard said the Anacostia's inaugural swim event is being modeled after one on the Charles River in Boston. But he also pointed to international models. In Switzerland's biggest city, Zurich, swimmers can hop into the Limmat river or Lake Zurich right downtown. The most enthusiastic locals in Zurich and Bernswim to and from workwith their phone, wallet, and clothes strapped to them ina floating waterproof satchel. Paris is poised toopen up its Seine River to swimmersfor the first time in 100 years. Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who's something ofa global urbanist hero, has pioneered a billion-dollar effort to clean up the iconic river in time to hold Olympic events in it next summer. Skepticism abounds about how clean the murky depths of the Anacostia are. Sherard said he hears plenty of ""hell no, never"" when it comes to swimming in the river, but he's also found real enthusiasm for opening the river up. There's lots of work left to do. Advocates for the river want Congress to approve funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the Anacostia to remove toxic sediment and ease flooding. If the river is dredged, it could also be a huge boost for the country's first African American boating club —Seafarers Yacht Club— whose boathouse on the river's west bank is only accessible in high tide because of accumulated sediment.

As the temperature keeps increasing, these effects are going to be magnified. There's going to be more storms, more fires, and people are going to be more worried about what could happen because a lot more things are happening.""Rising temperatures have also been associated with suicide attempts and increased rates of mental health-related emergency department visits, several studies have found. And long-term exposure to air pollution -- which the climate crisis can worsen by adding more particles from droughts or wildfires -- has been linked with elevated anxiety and an increase in suicides, according to CNN.Experts said that what's going on in the brains of people with schizophrenia or other conditions is just one factor that makes them more vulnerable to extreme heat, air pollution and stress and in need of support from loved ones, surrounding communities and policymakers.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'canada']",in,False,False

Massive Wild Fire forcing thousands of people to evacuate their homes, wildfires spreading rapidly, ... [+] escaping to save their lives, destroyed silhouette, natural calamity As our planet continues to warm, increased fires across the globe have created havoc globally with increased frequency and severity. Preventing wildfires and predicting their risks, before they are out of control is a priority for governments globally as the 2024 weather outlook is predicting another devastating heat scorching year ahead. Fighting wildfires is not only complex; it is dangerous and takes lives. Global Forest Watch tracks tree losses and their latest data on forest fires that compared to twenty years ago, determined that we are today burning twice as much tree cover. In addition, a recent study by the University of Maryland, calculated that forest fires result in three million more hectares of tree cover loss per year compared to 2001, an area roughly the size of Belgium, and accounted for more than one-quarter of all tree cover loss over the past twenty years. In 2023, we saw heightened fire activity, including record-breaking burns across Canada and catastrophic fires in Hawaii. The increasing levels of fire are accelerating due to climate change and the extreme heat waves which are already five times more likely today than one hundred years ago. One of the largest fires in the United States in 2022 was the California Mosquito Fire, which burned thousands of hectares of forest in and near areas classified as wildland- urban interfaces, destroying seventy-eight structures in nearby communities. This was just one of the many fires that made 2022, a record year in the U.S., with almost one million hectares of tree cover burned across the country, resulting in roughly $3.2 billion in damages. Furthermore, summer heat waves were a dominant force in driving fire activity across the Mediterranean basin. In 2022, record-breaking heat and drought in Spain resulted in more than 70,000 hectares of tree cover burned, the largest amount since 2001. Five years earlier, more than 130,000 hectares of tree cover burned in Portugal under similar circumstances, a greater loss than the previous ten years combined. Where I live in Canada, we experienced record levels of fires burning coast to coast. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported that an estimated 18.5 million hectares have burned in 2023, surpassing the previous high of 17.5 million hectares dating back to 1983. Finding new ways to forecasting wildfire risks is not new, however the methods using AI is relatively new, as an alternative method to combat changes brought about by increasingly climatic changes. Firefighters and start-ups are using AI-enabled cameras to scan the horizon for signs of smoke. A German company is building a constellation of satellites to detect fires from space. And Microsoft is using AI models to predict where the next blaze could be sparked. Another initiative is The FireAId initiative, led by the World Economic Forum, is using artificial intelligence (AI) to give those fighting fires a better chance of acting at earlier stages, before the fire becomes “wild.” In other words studying wildfire trends, analyzing data to build better prediction tools. Data, AI, and simulation technology can help cut through the complexity and give firefighters more insights to help fight the effects of climate change. The FireAId vision is to provide an intuitive tool that is both user-friendly and useful, allowing firefighters to gain valuable time, focusing resources where they will be most effective. Canada which was hard hit coast to coast with major forest devastations in 2023 is also innovating where Alberta’s Province’s forest firefighting agency partnered with Edmonton headquartered, AltaML, which can now successfully forecast a new wildfire eighty percent of the time. Using machine learning, the AltaML fight prevention AI Model analyzes thousands of data points to forecast, based on region, how likely new fires will be the next day. Given that it’s trained through historical fire data, it can also make predictions through regional weather and forest conditions. It analyzed global carbon emissions , each day of the week to see if there are any correlations with wildfires, climate change and human behaviour. One of the areas of research underway is ""Being able to predict where the most likely chance of wildfires are on a daily basis, so that crews and equipment can be placed appropriately ... it's looking like it's going to save millions of dollars just this fire season, just by reallocating resources to the right places,"" Co-Founder, Nicole Janssen, CEO has said. It is already estimated that the AltaML model can help Alberta Wildfire save between $2 million and $5 million in yearly operating costs. Another firefighting innovation is AUDREY, the Assistant for Understanding Data through Reasoning, Extraction, and synthesis, which is a NASA-developed software application that “performs data fusion and provides tailored situational awareness to first fire responders.” AUDREY collects essential fire data — like temperatures, the presence of gases, how quickly a fire develops, how the items that are burning effect fire growth, how much time firefighters have to respond, and fire flow paths. It then uses that data to help guide first responders through the scenario in the safest and most effective way possible. In the future, the hope is that AUDREY can serve as a guide for first responders and “track an entire team of firefighters, sending relevant signals to individuals while helping to make recommendations for how they could work together.” Wildfires are accelerating globally as the planet warms with the increasing presence of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Every year with global warming, millions of tons of CO2 is dumped into the environment. Forests take generations to recover from wildfire devastation and their impacts deplete natural resources, and harm lives of firefighters and residents. As the world continues to heat up, governments are scrambling to get ahead of the flames by tapping into the latest AI technology. Will AI give us a leg up, there is no question in my mind that it will. AI /ML Innovations from AltaML, Microsoft, NASA, and The World Economic Forum represent some of the heroic leadership efforts that are being made to detect and help prevent wildfires.","['belgium', 'canada', 'canada', 'canada', 'canada', 'canada', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'spain', 'portugal', 'china']",us,True,False

RIO DE JANEIRO — Taylor Swift postponed an Eras Tour concert in Rio de Janeiro Saturday after a 23-year-old fan died during her Friday night show, according to a message posted on the singer's Instagram. ""I'm writing this from my dressing room in the stadium. The decision has been made to postpone tonight's show due to the extreme temperatures in Rio,"" the singer said in a handwritten note on Instagram. ""The safety and well being of my fans, fellow performers, and crew has to and always will come first."" The cause of death for Ana Clara Benevides Machado, the young woman who sought medical attention at Nilton Santos Olympic Stadium during Friday's show, has not yet been announced. The office of Rio's public prosecutor opened a criminal investigation and said Benevides' body was being examined. Benevides' death shook many people in Brazil. She had taken her first flight ever to travel from the country's center-west region to Rio to see her favorite musician. She also created a WhatsApp group to keep her family updated, sending photos and videos every step of the way, family members told online news site G1. Fans and politicians reacted to her death with outrage, speculating it was linked to extreme heat. Concertgoers complained they were not allowed to take water into the stadium despite the stifling weather. As temperatures continued to rise Saturday and with two more shows to go at the time, federal authorities announced that free water would now be made available at concerts and other large events. One of Benevides' friends, who also went to the concert, told local outlets they had both been given water while waiting to enter the stadium. In a previous statement shared on her social media Saturday morning, Swift said she had a ""shattered heart."" ""There's very little information I have other than the fact that she was so incredibly beautiful and far too young,"" the singer wrote of the young woman. The show's organizer, Time4Fun, said on Instagram that paramedics attended to Benevides after she reported feeling unwell. She was taken to a first-aid center and then to a hospital, where she died an hour later, the statement from the Brazilian live entertainment company said.

Fans who attended the Friday show said they were not allowed to bring water bottles into the stadium even though Rio and most of Brazil have had record-breaking temperatures this week amid a dangerous and lasting heat wave. The daytime high in Rio on Friday was 39.1 degrees Celsius (102.4 degrees Fahrenheit), but it felt much hotter. Apparent temperature — a combination of temperature and humidity — hit 59 C (138 F) Friday morning in Rio, the highest index ever recorded there. Elizabeth Morin, 26, who recently moved to Rio from Los Angeles, described ""sauna-like"" conditions inside the stadium. ""It was extremely hot. My hair got so wet from sweat as soon as I came in,"" she said. ""There was a point at which I had to check my breathing to make sure I wasn't going to pass out."" Morin said she drank plenty of water but saw ""a good amount of people looking distressed"" and others ""yelling for water."" She said she was able to get water from the sidelines of the area she was standing in, but that water was a lot harder to access from other parts of the stadium, ""especially if you were concerned about losing your specific position."" During the show, Swift paused her performance and asked from the stage for water to be brought to a group of people who had successfully caught the singer's attention, according to Morin. ""They were holding up their phones saying 'We need water,'"" she recalled. Two other concertgoers interviewed by The Associated Press said they witnessed people feeling unwell from the heat during the show. On her way to Rio, Benevides sent a video to family members that was broadcast by TV channel Globo News, telling them: ""Mom, look at the plane, it's moving. Mom, I'm on the plane. My God in heaven! I'm happy!"" Then before the concert, she posted a video of herself on Instagram wearing a Taylor Swift T-shirt and friendship bracelets, seeking shade under an umbrella while waiting in line to enter the stadium. Like her, thousands of fans waited hours in the sun before being allowed inside. She told her followers while fanning her face that she'd arrived at 11 a.m. — the show began around 7:30 p.m. — and was ""still in the mess."" Benevides' friend, Daniele Menin, who attended the concert with her, told online news site G1 that her friend passed out at the beginning of the concert, as Swift performed her second song, ""Cruel Summer."" ""We always said that when (Taylor Swift) came to Brazil we would find a way to go. The ticket was very expensive, but we still found a way,"" Menin told G1. Justice Minister Flávio Dino said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that going forward in Brazil, ""water bottles for personal use, in suitable material, will be allowed"" at concerts and festivals and that show producers must provide free and easily accessible drinking water. Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes wrote on X that the ""loss of a young woman's life ... is unacceptable"" and demanded more brigades and ambulances at future shows. Still, the concert was postponed. ""We are on the train. And everyone is so disappointed,"" said Hely Olivares, a 41 year-old Venezuelan who had traveled from Panama to see the artist. Before postponing the concert, Swift wrote on Instagram that she would not address the death from stage ""because I feel overwhelmed by grief when I even try to talk about it."" ""I want to say now I feel this loss deeply and my broken heart goes out to her family and friends,"" she said.","['brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'not found', 'unitedstates', 'panama', 'china']",us,True,False

Following a record marine heat wave this past summer, Florida's iconic coral reef experienced massive bleaching and die-offs. One estimate from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute estimated that 60% of monitored coral reefs were bleached as a result of the stress — a sign that the coral could potentially die off if thestress is prolonged. Ian Enochs, the head of the coral program at NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, told theWall Street Journalthat his team is looking at a variety of methods to help the vulnerable sea creatures bolster their numbers. One such method was subjecting the coral to ""gyms,"" Enochs told the publication. In these tanks, corals are trained to withstand high temperatures and acidic seawater conditions in waves. The water is also injected with nitrogen and phosphorus — chemical pollutants most often associated with fertilizer runoff that couldexacerbate coral bleaching. ""If we hit corals twice a day with very high stressful temperatures, it toughens them up,"" Enochs told the Journal. Another method that the team is looking at is targeting the reproduction of coral to help boost their populations. This includes administering in vitro fertilization, or IVF, to quicken the growth of their larvae and giving them booster shots to prevent them from dying after experiencing bleaching. For years, scientists have been looking for ways to make coral resistant to heat as climate change results in more marine heatwaves and healthycoral reefscontinue to decline. In 2020, theBBC reportedthat a team of researchers tried altering the algae that live on coral to make it more heat-resistant, therefore making coral bleaching events less likely. Researchers are alsobreeding coral on landnow to prevent more die-offs and determine which species are more likely to survive human-induced climate change. ""If we can breed these corals growing in tanks and produce offspring by the tens of thousands we can start to have an impact on the problem,"" Andrew Baker, a principal investigator for the Darpa hybrid reef project, told the Journal. ""We are great at destroying reef ecosystems. We just need to reverse that trajectory and become great at restoring them.""","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'not found']",us,True,True

The study is titled ""The effect of temporal data aggregation to assess the impact of changing temperatures in Europe: an epidemiological modelling study.""In anearlier study, published inNature Medicine, the same team used epidemiological models applied to weekly temperature andmortality datain 823 regions in 35 European countries and estimated the number of heat-related premature deaths in 2022 to be 62,862.In that study, the authors acknowledged that the use of weekly data would be expected to underestimate heat-related mortality, and pointed out that daily time-series data are required to accurately estimate the impact of high temperatures on mortality.The objective of the new study was to develop atheoretical frameworkcapable of quantifying the errors arising from the use of aggregated data, such as weekly and monthlytemperatureand mortality time-series. Models based on temporally aggregated data are useful because aggregated data are available inreal-timefrom institutions such as Eurostat, facilitating quantification of the health hazard within a few days of its emergence.To develop a theoretical framework, the research team aggregated daily temperatures and mortality records from 147 regions in 16 European countries. They then analyzed and compared the estimates of heat- and cold-related mortality by different levels of aggregation: daily, weekly, two-weekly and monthly.Analysis revealed differences in epidemiological estimates according to the time scale of aggregation. In particular, it was found that weekly, two-weekly and monthly models underestimated the effects of heat and cold as compared to the daily model, and that the degree of underestimation increased with the length of the aggregation period.Specifically, for the period 1998–2004, the daily model estimated an annual cold and heat-related mortality of 290,104 and 39,434 premature deaths, respectively, while the weekly model underestimated these numbers by 8.56% and 21.56%, respectively.""It is important to note that the differences were very small during periods of extreme cold and heat, such as the summer of 2003, when the underestimation by the weekly data model was only 4.62%,"" explains Joan Ballester Claramunt, the ISGlobal researcher who leads the European Research Council'sEARLY-ADAPTproject.The team used this theoretical framework to revise the mortality burden attributed to the record temperatures experienced in 2022 in their earlier study. According to the calculations made using the new methodological approach, that study underestimated the heat-related mortality by 10.28%, which would mean that the actual heat-related mortality burden in 2022, estimated using the daily data model, was 70,066 deaths, and not 62,862 deaths as originally estimated.Using weekly data to analyze the effects of temperatures in the short term""In general, we do not find models based on monthly aggregated data useful for estimating the short-term effects of ambient temperatures,"" explains Ballester.""However, models based on weekly data do offer sufficient precision inmortalityestimates to be useful in real-time practice in epidemiological surveillance and to inform public policies such as, for example, the activation of emergency plans for reducing the impact of heat waves and cold spells.""It is an advantage in this area of research to be able to use weekly data since investigators often encounter bureaucratic obstacles that make it difficult or impossible to design large-scaleepidemiological studiesbased on daily data.According to Ballester, when daily data is not available, the use of weekly data, which are easily accessible for Europe in real-time, is a solution that can offer ""a good approximation of the estimates obtained using the daily datamodel"".",['not found'],gb,False,False

A 23-year-old Taylor Swift fan died Friday night after suffering from cardiac arrest due to heat at the concert, according to a statement from the show's organizers in Brazil. Springtime is underway in the southern Hemisphere, but across much of South America it has felt like the depths of summer for months already. A string of heat waves have settled in over the region, pushing temperatures into record-breaking territory month after month. Last week, temperatures soared in southern Brazil. In Rio de Janeiro, a city of nearly12 millionpeople, intense heat and humidity pushed a 23-year-old Brazilian university student into cardiac arrest at a Taylor Swift concert. Fans had stood in line for the Eras Tour at the Nilton Santos Olympic stadium in brutally hot, humid, windless conditions for hours before the Friday night show. It was just as hot and steamy inside the venue, concertgoers reported. The woman who died, Ana Clara Benevides Machado, got medical attention from paramedics at the concert venue, butdied later at a nearby hospital. Rio'stemperatures last weektopped 100 F. But theheat index–a measure that takes into account both air temperature and humidity–made itfeel like it was nearly 140 degrees Fahrenheit. People can only handle heat like that for a few hours before they start to get sick–or even die. Brazil's Ministry of Culture noted the extreme, dangerous heat in a statementexpressing condolencesfor Machado's death. This is a clear signal that climate change, the ministry said, has to be considered a major risk for events like big concerts or other cultural events now. Swift postponed a concert planned for Saturday night, another day that was supposed to be dangerously hot. The heat wave was the eighth major one of the year in Brazil, says Lincoln Alves, a climate scientist at Brazil's National Institute for Space Research. And it was almost certainly intensified by climate change, says Alves. He and colleagues analyzed a similar September heat wave, which was at least100 times as likely because of climate change. The past six months have each sequentially broken regional heat records, says Raul Cordero, a climate scientist at Chile's University of Santiago. ""October, it was the warmest October on record. September, it was the warmest September on record. And so on, since last May."" He pauses, and repeats it. ""Six months we have seen [record-breaking heat], in a row!"" It's extra hot across South America in part because the region is in the throes of El Niño, which pushes temperatures up a few degrees both regionally and globally. But that warming sits on top of long-term climate warming, driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels. ""This is not a coincidence what is happening, not only in Rio de Janeiro and in São Paulo in southern Brazil but also in Bolivia and Paraguay, and in Gran Chaco. All over. And a little further north in Brazil, not only are there high temperatures but very severe drought,"" says Cordero. ""It's a huge problem that's affecting not only southern Brazil but the whole subcontinent."" Average temperatures in São Paulo have gone up by more than 3 degrees Fahrenheit since the 1960s. A few extra degrees of warming may not sound like much, says Alves, but the increase in the number ofextremeheat days has skyrocketed. In the 1960s, there were about seven days of serious heat in the region–about one major heat wave a year. Now, annually there are more than 50 days of extremely hot weather, or about 9 major heat events. That number is forecast toincrease further in the future. Air temperatures in Rio de Janeiro were sweltering last week as concertgoers waited to get into the Nilton Santos stadium for Swift's Eras Tour Friday night. People waited for hours in the sun to get into the venue, and many didn't have water to drink. High humidity was the other problem. People cool down by sweating: when water evaporates, it pulls away the heat that has built up in the body. But when the air is intensely humid–in other words, when it's holding nearly all the water vapor it can–that sweat doesn't evaporate. It stays beaded up on the skin, useless. ""When we're thinking about the real big dangers to the human body, humid heat stress is one of the biggest,"" says Daniel Vecellio, a climate scientist and heat expert at George Mason University. ""When it starts to get really humid, we can sweat as much as we want to, but if that sweat can't evaporate...that basically shuts off our main physiological mechanism to be able to cool ourselves down."" The air in Rio last week was still and stagnant making it nearly impossible for sweat to evaporate. The air was heavy with humidity. The body can also cool down by shunting blood toward the tinier vessels near the skin, where it can–hopefully–come into contact with cooler air. That puts stress on the heart, which needs to pump harder to move blood around. That's why heart problems, like the one that killed Machado, go up during heat waves, says Veliccio. It's not like people in Brazil are unaccustomed to heat, says Alves. ""But these times, in September, October, right now, the temperature puts too much pressure. Even these people who are, I would say, more familiar with these kinds of climates, face stress based on these extreme events."" Heat as all-encompassing and extreme as last week's in Rio will always be dangerous, says Marisol Yglesias-González, a climate expert at the Centro LatinoAmericano de Excelencia en Cambio Climático y Salud in Costa Rica. But warning people in advance of extreme heat, for example, can help reduce the dangers. Designing emergency heat plans at venues like the Nilton Santos stadium and other public venues is another way to lower risks brought on by hot temperatures. Some of the work to reduce heat risks can come from governments. Cities, where vast amounts of concrete absorb heat and push temperatures up, can develop green spaces or cooling centers. National meteorological systems can send out early warnings to help people plan for the worst times, though it's crucial to design effective warnings that reach everyone they need to, stresses Yglesias-González. Brazil's meteorological agency sent out heat warnings last week. Efforts need to happen in the private sector, as well. The Brazilian Ministry of Culture stressed in its statement that the new risks of climate change entail coordinated efforts from event hosts. Emergency heat protocols are critical, says Yglesias-González. For example, the Nilton Santos stadium prohibited concertgoers from bringing water bottles inside. That led to dehydration for many fans.Brazil's justice ministersaid on X, formerly Twitter, that water bottles would be allowed into venues in the future. ""They were not allowing people to bring their bottles of water into the venue? Like really, this is not the 70s, we don't have the weather of the 70s! We're facing an existential crisis with climate change,"" says Yglesias-González. ""If we're going to do these types of events, we have to acknowledge that climate change is a risk. And be prepared for that, to protect the people that we are bringing to see this type of show."" That meanseveryone, from private companies and city governments to nonprofits, needs climate plans, she says. Because of the ongoing heat, Swift postponed a show planned for Saturday. Billboard, which has begun tracking concerts affected by climate-influenced extreme weather,has counted 30 shows postponed or canceled so far in 2023due to heat, floods, and other weather problems. Adapting to the heat problems that exist, and will continue to worsen as climate change marches onward, is one half of the challenge, says Cordero, the Chilean climate scientist. The other half is tackling the root cause of human-driven climate change: drastically reducing planet warming pollution. Swift, like other members of the richest 1% of Earth's inhabitants, has a disproportionately high impact on climate change. That group alone is responsible for about 20% of global emissions, according to anew report from Oxfam released this week.","['brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'mexico', 'germany', 'bolivia', 'paraguay', 'costarica']",us,False,False

Extreme heat, air pollution and the increasing spread of deadly infectious diseases are just some of the reasons why the World Health Organization has called climate change the single biggest health threat facing humanity. Global warming must be limited to the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees Celsius ""to avert catastrophic health impacts and prevent millions of climate change-related deaths"", according to the WHO. However, under current national carbon-cutting plans, the world is on track to warm up to 2.9C this century, the UN said this week. While no one will be completely safe from the effects of climate change, experts expect that most at risk will be children, women, the elderly, migrants and people in less developed countries which have emitted the least planet-warming greenhouse gases. On December 3, the COP28 negotiations in Dubai will host the first ""health day"" ever held at the climate negotiations. This year is widely expected to be the hottest on record. And as the world continues to warm, even more frequent and intense heatwaves are expected to follow. Heat is believed to have caused more than 70,000 deaths in Europe during summer last year, researchers said this week, revising the previous number up from 62,000. Worldwide, people were exposed to an average of 86 days of life-threatening temperatures last year, according to the Lancet Countdown report earlier this week. The number of people over 65 who died from heat rose by 85 percent from 1991-2000 to 2013-2022, it added. And by 2050, more than five times more people will die from the heat each year under a 2C warming scenario, the Lancet Countdown projected. More droughts will also drive rising hunger. Under the scenario of 2C warming by the end of the century, 520 million more people will experience moderate or severe food insecurity by 2050. Meanwhile, other extreme weather events such as storms, floods and fires will continue to threaten the health of people across the world. Almost 99 percent of the world's population breathes air that exceeds the WHO's guidelines for air pollution. Outdoor air pollution driven by fossil fuel emissions kills more than four million people every year, according to the WHO. It increases the risk of respiratory diseases, strokes, heart disease, lung cancer, diabetes and other health problems, posing a threat that has been compared to tobacco. The damage is caused partly by PM2.5 microparticles, which are mostly from fossil fuels. People breathe these tiny particles into their lungs, where they can then enter the bloodstream. While spikes in air pollution, such as extremes seen in India's capital New Delhi earlier this month, trigger respiratory problems and allergies, long-term exposure is believed to be even more harmful. However it is not all bad news. The Lancet Countdown report found that deaths from air pollution due to fossil fuels have fallen 16 percent since 2005, mostly due to efforts to reduce the impact of coal burning. The changing climate means that mosquitoes, birds and mammals will roam beyond their previous habitats, raising the threat that they could spread infectious diseases with them. Mosquito-borne diseases that pose a greater risk of spreading due to climate change include dengue, chikungunya, Zika, West Nile virus and malaria. The transmission potential for dengue alone will increase by 36 percent with 2C warming, the Lancet Countdown report warned. Storms and floods create stagnant water that are breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and also increase the risk of water-borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid and diarrhoea. Scientists also fear that mammals straying into new areas could share diseases with each other, potentially creating new viruses that could then jump over to humans. Worrying about the present and future of our warming planet has also provoked rising anxiety, depression and even post-traumatic stress -- particularly for people already struggling with these disorders, psychologists have warned. In the first 10 months of the year, people searched online for the term ""climate anxiety"" 27 times more than during the same period in 2017, according to data from Google Trends cited by the BBC this week.","['unitedarabemirates', 'india', 'india']",us,False,False

In turn, stress can raise the likelihood of abusing substances and increase the likelihood of relapse.(With inputs from PTI) Ahead of the impending UN climate talks , there have been mounting concerns regarding the implications that global warming is having on people's health. The World Health Organization (WHO) underscores the urgency, citing extreme heat, air pollution , and the surge in deadly infectious diseases as critical threats to human well-being. Central to the WHO's assertion is the necessity to cap global warming within the confines of the Paris Agreement , limiting the rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This measure is deemed crucial to avert catastrophic health crises and prevent millions of climate-related fatalities. Alarming projections, however, unveiled by the UN, suggest an ominous trajectory with the world veering towards a 2.9-degree Celsius increase by the century's end. While the repercussions of climate change will reverberate globally, specific demographics—children, women, the elderly, migrants, and those in less developed nations with lower greenhouse gas emissions—are deemed most susceptible. A groundbreaking move is slated for the upcoming COP28 discussions in Dubai, earmarking December 3 as the inaugural "" health day "" within the climate negotiations. Rising Threat of Extreme Heat Amid forecasts predicting this year to potentially set a new record for heat, there's mounting concern over the amplified frequency and severity of heatwaves as global temperatures continue to soar. Recent studies revised upwards last year's European heat-related death toll to over 70,000, significantly higher than previously estimated. According to findings from the Lancet Countdown report, individuals worldwide faced an average of 86 days exposed to life-threatening temperatures last year. Moreover, statistics reveal a distressing 85 percent surge in heat-related deaths among individuals aged over 65 from 1991-2000 to 2013-2022. Dire projections foresee a staggering fivefold increase in annual heat-related fatalities by 2050 under a 2-degree Celsius warming scenario. Anticipated surges in droughts pose a parallel threat of exacerbating hunger crises. Projections indicate that a 2-degree Celsius rise by the century's close could subject an additional 520 million individuals to moderate or severe food insecurity by 2050. Furthermore, the escalating frequency of extreme weather events like storms, floods, and fires continues to imperil global health. Combatting Air Pollution Challenges Alarmingly, nearly 99 percent of the global population breathes air that exceeds WHO's air pollution guidelines. Fossil fuel-driven outdoor air pollution claims over four million lives annually, triggering a spectrum of respiratory diseases and other severe health complications, akin to the perils posed by tobacco consumption. The adverse impact is primarily attributed to PM2.5 microparticles from fossil fuels, infiltrating the lungs and bloodstream, deteriorating health conditions. While acute spikes in air pollution, exemplified by recent incidents in New Delhi, provoke immediate respiratory issues, prolonged exposure amplifies health risks. Encouragingly, the Lancet Countdown report highlights a 16 percent decline in fossil fuel-related air pollution deaths since 2005, primarily attributable to measures curtailing coal burning. Escalating Concerns Over Infectious Diseases Climate fluctuations are propelling various species beyond their traditional habitats, escalating the risk of transmitting infectious diseases. Mosquito-borne ailments such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, West Nile virus, and malaria pose heightened risks due to climate-induced shifts. Projections from the Lancet Countdown report indicate a concerning 36 percent surge in dengue transmission potential under a 2-degree Celsius warming scenario. Additionally, extreme weather events generate stagnant water, fostering mosquito breeding grounds, while amplifying the risk of waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea. Scientists express concerns about potential cross-species disease transmission among mammals, potentially leading to the emergence of new viruses hazardous to humans. Elevated Mental Health Challenges The mounting apprehension about the present and future consequences of climate change has engendered increased anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress among individuals. Psychologists flag a notable surge in climate-related psychological distress, particularly among those already grappling with mental health disorders. Notably, data from Google Trends revealed a 27-fold increase in online searches for ""climate anxiety"" during the first ten months of this year compared to the same period in 2017, indicating the escalating concerns regarding the psychological impact of climate change.

Long experience of the harsh desert summers has taught the country to live with temperatures that regularly flirt with 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit), she said. ""We've actually been on the journey of adaptation for many years now,"" Mariam Almheiri, the UAE's minister of climate change and environment, said in an interview ahead of the COP28 United Nations climate talks in Dubai. ""When you look at the temperatures now currently in the summer, there are people from around the world that say: 'How do you live in that temperature?' ""But actually we can stay here during the summer and we live fine. We're able to do the activities we want to do. It's just we have already adapted since many, many years."" The UAE's scorching summers, when many flee for cooler climes and the streets empty, look set to worsen due to climate change, various studies show. The Gulf region's extreme heat and high humidity are a dangerous mix as in such conditions the human body struggles to cool itself by evaporating sweat on the skin. The combination is measured by a thermometer wrapped in a wet cloth to calculate the ""wet bulb temperature"" -- the lowest possible through evaporative cooling. The Gulf is one of the few places to have repeatedly measured wet bulb temperatures above 35C (95F), the threshold of human survivability beyond which heat stress can be fatal within hours, regardless of age, health and fitness. It is for this reason that experts warn accelerated climate change will make parts of the Gulf region unlivable by the end of this century. As global temperatures tick higher, with this year on course to be the hottest on record, the UAE is changing its building designs and urban planning to create cooler living environments, even outdoors, Almheiri said. More parks and vegetation, including a plan to plant 100 million mangroves -- an effective carbon sink -- by 2030, will also mitigate the heat, she added. ""People don't realise that actually, already more than 70 percent of our economy is non oil-based. We have actually already set up a lot of the renewable energy infrastructure,"" she said. ""We've also made sure that buildings are set or start to be built at a certain level to take care of any sea-level rise that the models are looking like it might come up soon."" The high temperatures mean air-conditioning is used nearly year-round in the UAE's homes, offices, malls, cars and even bus stops, a key factor in making its carbon footprint one of the world's biggest per capita. Other contributors are the fleets of SUVs, muscle cars and sports vehicles that clog the multi-lane highways, scant mass transport, and energy-heavy attractions such as an indoor ski slope with artificial snow that is kept at a steady minus -2C (28.4F). Despite these challenges, the UAE is targeting domestic carbon neutrality by 2050 -- not including exported oil and gas -- by ramping up nuclear, solar and wind energy, extending metro and rail services, and promoting electric vehicles. The UAE's Masdar -- chaired by COP28 president and state oil giant CEO Sultan Al Jaber -- is one of the world's biggest renewable energy companies, signalling the country's ambitions to lead the energy transition. Changing blase attitudes to energy and resources, in a multicultural, multi-lingual, often transient environment that is 90 percent expatriate, is one of the key tasks for the UAE, Almheiri said. ""We look at it sector by sector, bringing in the private sector, bringing in community members, academia, and really making sure that youth are also part of this conversation, to understand how we can decarbonise these sectors, but how also individuals can do their part as well,"" the minister said. ""I myself always talk about stories that I do at home, whether it's trying to make sure you don't put any edible food in the bin, being a little bit more conscious about what you're buying, where is it sourced from,"" she added. ""The net zero strategy that we have just announced... it's a pathway that's pro-climate, pro-growth, but it also means that there needs to be mindset change in the way we do business and the way we live,"" Almheiri said.","['unitedstates', 'unitedarabemirates']",us,True,True

That's the amount countries have agreed to limit warming to by the end of the century. The world is already perilously close to that number. Since the Industrial Revolution, the planet has warmed by about 1.2 degrees Celsius, predominantly due to heat-trapping emissions that come from burning fossil fuels. This year is expected to be the hottest on record, withtemperatures in Septemberreaching 1.8 degrees Celsius above average. Currently, theworld is on track for just under 3 degreesCelsius of warming (more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century. While a few degrees of difference may seem small, climate research shows that every tenth of a degree can have a profound effect when it comes to the dangers posed by extreme weather. ""We're not destined for some catastrophic climate,"" says Deepti Singh, who is an assistant professor at Washington State University. ""We know that we can have a future that is more equitable and less volatile if we limit the warming through our actions today."" Here are three climate impacts that get substantially worse in the U.S. if the world exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. When scientists use numbers like 1.5 degrees Celsius to measure climate change, it represents an average of all the annual temperatures worldwide. That average masks the fact that some parts of the planet are heating up faster than others. Loading... In fact, the U.S. is warming up at a faster rate than the global average, which means the effects of climate change will be more pronounced. That difference has to do with how the extra heat is absorbed, as well as regional weather patterns. Generally,warming is happening faster on landand in the polar regions. ""The U.S. has already warmed at a rate that's higher than the global average,"" says Singh. ""We're warming at a rate that's 60% higher than that."" Hurricanes and tropical storms are getting more intense as the climate warms, but they aren't the only storms affected. Even regular rainstorms are getting more extreme. ""Every time we have a heavy rainfall event, it's more likely to be even heavier than what we're typically used to seeing,"" says Deanna Hence, assistant professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. ""So that can mean flooding and other risks that come with those really high rainfall rates."" The air in a hotter atmosphere can hold more water vapor, which can fuel heavier rainfall. That means that beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, cities in the Midwest and Northeast will be faced with dramatically more water, which can overwhelm storm drains and infrastructure, causing flooding. Today,most cities aren't designing their infrastructureto handle more intense rain. Heat waves take a massive and sometimeshidden toll in the U.S., causing cardiovascular and other health impacts, in addition to deaths. Climate science shows they're already getting longer and more intense. Nighttime temperatures are also increasing, which exacerbates the effects of a heat wave. Humans, animals and plants need recovery time from extreme daytime temperatures. Without it, health impacts and crop losses are even greater. As the planet warms, winters will also be affected. The number of days below freezing would shrink past 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, especially in the Mountain West. That could impair the snowpack that provides a vital water source for millions of people.Warmer winterscan also harm crops and increase vector-borne diseases.","['unitedarabemirates', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'india']",us,True,False
