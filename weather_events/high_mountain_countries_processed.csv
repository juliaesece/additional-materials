Shishapangma, at just over 8,000m, is the world's 14th tallest peak. It is widely regarded as one of the easier mountains of that height, known among climbers as the ""eight-thousanders"". Two avalanches hit its slopes at elevations of 7,600m and 8,000m on Saturday (Oct 7), killing American climber Anna Gutu and Nepalese guide Mingmar Sherpa, Xinhua reported. Another American climber, Gina Marie Rzucidlo, and her Nepalese guide, Tenjen Sherpa, were missing. Tenjen Sherpa was the guide for Norway's Kristin Harila when they climbed K2 in Pakistan in July tobecome the world's fastest climbers to scale all 14 peaks over 8,000m. Another Nepalese guide Karma, Geljen Sherpa, was seriously hurt on Saturday but was escorted down the mountain by rescuers. A total of 52 climbers were pushing for the summit when the avalanches hit, including from the United States, Britain, Romania, Albania, Italy, Japan and Pakistan, Xinhua said. All climbing activity on Shishapangma was suspended due to the unstable snow conditions. Two Pakistani climbers narrowly escaped the avalanches on Saturday after calling off their summit bid because of poor weather despite coming within a few hundred metres of the peak, Pakistani media reported. Had one of the Pakistani climbers, Sirbaz Khan, reached the top of Shishapangma he would have become the first Pakistani to summit all 14 mountains over 8,000m. More than 300 successful summits of Shishapangma have been logged to date, with under 10 per cent of climbers who tried to reach the top dying in their attempts, according to private estimates. That compares with the nearly 30 per cent fatality rate for Nepal's Annapurna I, one of the world's most dangerous peaks. Among those who had previously died on Shishapangma was famed American climber Alex Lowe in 1999, also because of an avalanche. His body as well as the remains of his climbing companion David Bridges were found in 2016 in a partially melted glacier. October is a popular month for climbers in the Himalayas due to its traditionally more stable conditions as monsoon rain eases. But scientists warn that global warming is raising avalanche risks in high-altitude regions including the Himalayas. Last week, a Chinese expedition set up a series of weather stations on the 8,201-metre Cho Oyu on Tibet's border with Nepal tomeasure the impact of climate change in the Himalayas.","['china', 'china', 'china', 'china', 'china', 'china', 'china', 'china', 'norway', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'unitedstates', 'unitedkingdom', 'romania', 'albania', 'italy', 'japan', 'nepal', 'nepal']",sg,False,False

The aim is to equip communities with timely and critical risk awareness that bolsters disaster resilience and safeguards lives and livelihoods.Landslidescause thousands of deathsand billions of dollars in damage every year. Developing countries often beardisproportionate lossesdue to lack of access to hazard early warning systems and other resources for effective risk reduction and recovery. Reports from theUnited Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reductionemphasize that early warning systems and early action are among the most effective ways to decrease disaster-related deaths and losses.""Somelocal authoritiesdevelop their own systems to monitor landslide risk, but there isn't a global model that works in the same way. That's what defines LHASA: it works all the time and it covers most regions of the world,"" says Robert Emberson, NASA Disasters associate program manager and a key member of the NASA landslides team. ""Thanks to our collaboration with the Pacific Disaster Center, this powerful landslide technology is now even more accessible for the communities that need it most.""LHASA uses a machine learning model that combines data on ground slope, soil moisture, snow, geological conditions, distance to faults, and the latest near real-timeprecipitationdata from NASA's IMERG product (part of the Global Precipitation Measurement mission). The model has been trained on adatabaseof historical landslides and the conditions surrounding them, allowing it to recognize patterns that indicate a landslide is likely.The result is a landslide ""nowcast""—a map showing the potential of rainfall-triggered landslides occurring for any given region within the past day. This map of hazard likelihood can help agencies and officials rapidly assess areas where the current landslide risk is high. It can also give disaster response teams critical information on where a landslide may have occurred so they can investigate and deploy life-saving resources.This screenshot from PDC's DisasterAWARE Pro software shows LHASA landslide hazard probabilities for Myanmar in Sept. 2023.

To be truly effective, vulnerable communities must receive the data in a way that is accessible and easy to integrate into existing disaster management plans. That's where the Pacific Disaster Center comes in.PDC is an applied research center managed by the University of Hawaii, and it shares NASA's goal to reduce global disaster risk through innovative uses of science and technology. Its flagship DisasterAWARE software provides early warnings and risk assessment tools for 18 types of natural hazards and supports decision-making by a wide range of disaster management agencies, local governments, and humanitarian organizations. Prominent users include the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), and the World Food Program (WFP).""The close pairing of our organizations and use of PDC's DisasterAWARE platform for early warning has been a special recipe for success in getting life-saving information into the hands of decision-makers and communities around the world,"" said Chris Chiesa, PDC deputy executive director.The collaboration with PDC brings NASA's landslide tool to tens of thousands of existing DisasterAWARE users, dramatically increasing LHASA's reach and effectiveness. Chiesa notes that teams in El Salvador, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic have already begun using these new capabilities to assess landslide hazards during the 2023 rainy season.PDC's software ingests and interprets LHASA model data and generates maps of landslide risk severity. It then uses the data to generatelandslidehazard alerts for a chosen region that the DisasterAWARE mobile app pushes to users. These alerts give communities critical information on potential hazards, enabling them to take protective measures.DisasterAWARE landside risk report for Myanmar, showing estimated population, infrastructure and capital exposure to landslide risk, as well as the community's needs.

A group of researchers led by Dr. Jens Karstens from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel has now surveyed Kolumbo's underwater crater with modern imaging technology and reconstructed the historical events.They found that the eyewitness accounts of the natural disaster can only be described by a combination of a landslide followed by an explosive eruption. Their findings are published today in the journalNature Communications.From the Greek island of Santorini, the eruption had been visible for several weeks. In the late summer of 1650, people reported that the color of the water had changed and the water was boiling. About seven kilometers north-east of Santorini, anunderwater volcanohad risen from the sea and began ejecting glowing rocks.Fire and lightning could be seen, and plumes of smoke darkened the sky. Then the water suddenly receded, only to surge towards the coastline moments later, battering it with waves up to 20 meters high. A huge bang was heard more than 100 kilometers away, pumice and ash fell on the surrounding islands, and a deadly cloud of poisonous gas claimed several lives.""We know these details of the historic eruption of Kolumbo because there are contemporary reports that were compiled and published by a French volcanologist in the 19th century,"" says Dr. Jens Karstens, marine geophysicist at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel.But how did these devastating events come about? To find out, he and his German and Greek colleagues went to the Greek Aegean Sea in 2019 to study the volcanic crater with special technology. Karstens says, ""We wanted to understand how the tsunami came about at that time and why the volcano exploded so violently.""On board the now decommissionedresearch vesselPOSEIDON, the team used 3D seismic methods to create a three-dimensional image of the crater, which is now 18 meters below the water's surface. Dr. Gareth Crutchley, co-author of the study, says, ""This allows us to look inside the volcano.""Not only did the 3D imaging show that the crater was 2.5 kilometers in diameter and 500 meters deep, suggesting a truly massive explosion, the seismic profiles also revealed that one flank of the cone had been severely deformed.Crutchley says, ""This part of the volcano has certainly slipped."" The researchers then took a detective's approach, comparing the various mechanisms that could have caused the tsunami with the historical eyewitness accounts. They concluded that only a combination of a landslide followed by a volcanic explosion could explain the tsunami.By combining 3D seismics withcomputer simulations, the researchers were able to reconstruct how high the waves would have been if they had been generated by the explosion alone. Karstens says, ""According to this, waves of six meters would have been expected at one particular location, but we know from the reports of eyewitnesses that they were 20 meters high there.""Furthermore, the sea is said to have first receded at another point, but in the computer simulation a wave crest reaches the coast first. Thus, the explosion alone cannot explain the tsunami event. However, when the landslide was included in the simulations, the data agreed with historical observations.Jens Karstens explains, ""Kolumbo consists partly of pumice with very steep slopes. It is not very stable. During the eruption, which had been going on for several weeks, lava was continuously ejected. Underneath, in the magma chamber, which contained a lot of gas, there was enormous pressure. When one of the volcano's flanks slipped, the effect was like uncorking a bottle of champagne: the sudden release of pressure allowed the gas in the magma system to expand, resulting in a huge explosion.""Something similar could have happened during the 2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga undersea volcano, whosevolcanic craterhas a similar shape to Kolumbo's.The study thus provides valuable information for the development of monitoring programs for active submarinevolcanic activity, such as SANTORY, which is led by co-author Prof. Paraskevi Nomikou of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA). ""We hope to be able to use our results to develop new approaches to monitor volcanic unrest,"" says Jens Karstens, ""maybe even an early warning system, collecting data in real time. That would be my dream.""","['greece', 'tonga', 'mexico']",gb,False,False

Two others, American climber Gina Marie Rzucidlo and a Nepalese mountain guide Tenjen Sherpa went missing, the news agency said. Sherpa was one half of a duo who shattered the record for the fastest climb of the 14 mountains more than 8,000 meters (about 26,000 feet) high in July this year. He wanted to become the youngest climber to scale all 14 peaks twice. The avalanches also seriously injured Nepalese mountain guide Karma Geljen Sherpa, who was escorted down the mountain by rescuers and is currently in stable condition. A total of 52 climbers from various countries including the U.S., Britain,Japan, andItalywere attempting to summit the mountain when the avalanches hit, Xinhua said. Climbing activities on Shishapangma have since been suspended due to snow conditions. Shishapangma is the 14th-highest mountain in the world, at over 8,027 meters (26,335 ft) above sea level. October is a popular time to trek the Himalayas as it’s after the rainy monsoon season, but experts have cautioned that climate change has increased the risk of avalanches in the region.

MEXICO CITY Hurricane Otis strengthened from tropical storm to a … [+1118 chars]",Bermuda,"People are helped as they cross a highway blocked by a landslide triggered by Hurricane Otis near Acapulco, Mexico, on Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2023.Marco Ugarte/APhide caption People are helped as they cross a highway blocked by a landslide triggered by Hurricane Otis near Acapulco, Mexico, on Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2023. ACAPULCO, Mexico — Hurricane Otis slammed Mexico's southern Pacific coast as a powerful and dangerous Category 5 hurricane Wednesday, unleashing massive flooding in the resort city of Acapulco, sending sheets of earth down steep mountainsides, and leaving large swaths of the state of Guerrero without power or cellphone service. While little is known about possible deaths or the full extent of the damage — the main highway into Acapulco was impassable — experts are calling Otis the strongest storm in history to make landfall along the Eastern Pacific Coast. Acapulco's Diamond Zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, appeared to be mostly underwater in television footage shared online Wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water. Large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. Dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. People wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other less-flooded streets soldiers shoveled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement. By late Wednesday afternoon, Otis had weakened to below tropical depression strength and was dissipating over the mountains, yet many on the coast were left reeling. Just outside Acapulco, Flor Campos trudged for more than an hour through mud along a highway Wednesday morning before she peeled off her shoes, worried she'd lose them in the muck. The domestic worker from a small town in Guerrero was among dozens of families, women and children who clambered over tree trunks and other debris left by landslides in the mountainous terrain. It was a daunting escape, but people were desperate to get out. ""We had been waiting since 3 in the morning to get out, so we decided to walk. It was more dangerous to stay. There are trees knocked down, power lines down,"" Campos said. ""There are children back there, 2 or 3 years old, with no water, nothing."" On Tuesday, Otis took many by surprise when it rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 as it tore along the coast. Researchers tracking the storm told The Associated Press that the storm broke records for how quickly it intensified, at a time whenclimate change has exacerbateddevastating weather events like this one. ""It's one thing to have a Category 5 hurricane make landfall somewhere when you're expecting it or expecting a strong hurricane, but to have it happen when you're not expecting anything to happen is truly a nightmare,"" said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. Acapulco, Tecpan and other towns along the Costa Grande in Guerrero were hit hard, said Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. He said conditions were so bad that communication with the area had been ""completely lost."" Acapulco is a city of nearly 1 million people at the foot of steep mountains. Luxury homes and slums alike cover the city's hillsides with views of the glistening Pacific. Once drawing Hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, Acapulco has in more recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving many international tourists to the Caribbean waters of Cancun and the Riviera Maya or beaches farther down the Pacific coast in the state of Oaxaca. Between the internationally known resorts of Acapulco and Zihuatanejo are two dozen small towns and villages. On the outskirts of Acapulco on Wednesday, highway workers looked on helplessly without the heavy machinery needed to clear debris from the roadway. They warned the road could give way at any time because of the rain-softened ground beneath. Bridges in some areas had collapsed, and trees leaned almost horizontally across the highway, not because they were uprooted, but because the earth they grew on had slid down the slope. Damage to the local military airport made it hard for authorities to access the region, López Obrador said. He said high-ranking members of his government would travel to Guerrero to help. Mexico's Secretary of National Defense told The Associated Press on Wednesday that 7,000 military personnel had been deployed to the area, and that more than 1,200 more were on their way. A long convoy of trucks from the national electric company moved through the Guerrero state capital, Chilpancingo, toward Acapulco before dawn Wednesday. Officials in Guerrero said on Wednesday afternoon that they were working to restore phone service. Otis is stronger than Hurricane Pauline, which hit Acapulco in 1997, López Obrador said. Pauline destroyed swaths of the city and killed more than 200 people. Hundreds of others were injured in flooding and mudslides. Otis' arrival camejust days after Hurricane Normastruck the southern tip of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula to the north. While many were caught by surprise, Acapulco still was able to open two dozen shelters in the hours before Otis made landfall. Videos from hotel guests in Acapulco posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, as the storm came ashore showed blinding horizontal rain and howling winds. In one, white towels danced high above a hotel's cavernous courtyard like sheets of paper and bed mattresses trembled on balconies, apparently put there to blunt the storm's winds. Another showed wind and rain howling unimpeded down hotel hallways. In still another, a family huddled inside a hotel room shower to escape breaking windows and fierce wind. In the Atlantic, Hurricane Tammy moved northeast over open water with winds of 105 mph after sweeping through the Lesser Antilles over the weekend. Tammy was about 515 miles southeast of Bermuda, and was moving northeast at about 13 mph. The storm was expected to become a powerful extratropical cyclone by Thursday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.","['mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'india', 'guatemala', 'unitedstates']",us,True,False

Forty-three people were killed in the western city of Bafoussam in 2019, when a landslide triggered by heavy rains swept away a dozen flimsy dwellings built on the side of a hill.","['cameroon', 'cameroon']",us,False,False

The transalpine line was a key method of transport for tourists taking advantage of the ski season and Christmas holidays in the two European countries. With the train link now unavailable this winter, visitors will have to fly or drive between the two destinations. Authorities are warning of much heavier traffic on roads and increased demand for flights, with both adding carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Key Italy-France rail link closed until summer 2024 Train services connecting Italy and France were suspended following a landslide in the Maurienne Valley area on 27 August. Some 10,000 cubic metres of rock fell following torrential rain in Saint-André à La Praz, around 20 kilometres from the French border with Italy. It forced the Fréjus tunnel, a major road link between St Michel de Maurienne and Modane, to close temporarily. A little over a week after the incident, the tunnel reopened to vehicles. The adjacent Fréjus rail tunnel remains shut, however, as repair work takes place. Initially, the line was expected to reopen after two months, but French authorities now say works are proving more challenging than anticipated. François Ravier, Savoie official and regional director of French rail operator SNCF, told press that construction would last another seven months, hopefully finishing in summer 2024. At the moment, efforts are still underway to secure the zone affected by the landslide, according to Italian newspaper La Stampa. Predictions are that the route could reopen in June 2024, although there’s a chance services could remain suspended until September affecting the busy summer season. How is the Italy-France rail tunnel closure affecting tourism? Major rail services are affected by the continuing closure of the Fréjus rail tunnel. The TGV and Frecciarossa trains between Paris and Milan are not running and freight trains are also having to find alternative solutions. This will mean “long and expensive detours through Switzerland,” according to the Transalpine Lyon-Turin railway committee. Travellers are expected to “turn to the car for medium-distance journeys and flights for long distances,” the committee said. France has been trying to reduce short-haul flights . The flight connection between Paris and Milan is already one of the busiest in Europe. Spanish low-cost airline Volotea has announced additional flights on the route in response to more demand. Travellers driving between Maurienne and the Susa Valley as well as on the Turin ring road should prepare for heavier traffic. Furthermore, the Mont Blanc road tunnel is scheduled to close between 16 October and 18 December for maintenance which could cause greater disruption in the run up to Christmas. Preparations are underway for a ‘transport hub’ at the Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne station in time for the 2023-24 ski season, according to Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore. From here, TGV passengers will be able to board shuttle buses to resorts in the area.","['france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'switzerland', 'unitedstates']",eu,False,False

Skiing and snow… [+14810 chars]",Weather,"Give the gift of warmth this holiday season! The biggest complaint of skiers is cold fingers and ... [+] toes, and Canada's ewool solves both with its cutting edge heated gear Skiing and snowboarding have been extremely popular since the pandemic, and after last year’s record snow and a slate of resort expansions this season (see my article on all the new terrain and lifts here), another big winter is expected. So, if you know someone who loves skiing or snowboarding, it’s a great theme for holiday gifts, and all of the items below have been personally vetted and curated to be first-rate, high-quality choices. Heated Everything: Even people who love skiing occasionally complain, and there is nothing that frustrates more skiers and snowboarders than the cold. After all, there’s a reason they call it a “winter sport.” So, if you know someone who suffers from cold toes, cold fingers or cold anything, your holiday shopping is easy and finished. Newly offered in the United States, ewool is a proven Canadian leader in heated apparel technology. There are a number of good outdoor gear companies making heated ski gloves, but heated socks are far less common, and both tend to be very expensive. Ewool takes a different approach making heated glove liners rather than heated ski gloves, and ditto for socks and even vests. This much more versatile approach lets you turn any gloves into heated gloves, any boots into heated boots and the vest keeps the core warm on and off the slopes. These are great for skiing or anything else - all these products also work great for football games, ice fishing or myriad other activities. ewool ski sock covers turn any boot into a heated boot. The technology is rock solid, the batteries are extremely powerful by industry standards, the charging is fast and simple and the controls easy to use on the field. They offer up to 7 hours of heat on a single charge, which is quite long for heated garments, have three levels of comfort, and the gloves and liners are machine washable, a big plus for sports gear. In the gloves every finger is individually heated, whereas some models just heat the main hand area, and they are touchscreen compatible so you can still use your phone. The sock covers go on over ski socks and still fit easily in your boots, have a comfortable open heel design, and offer a second battery pocket giving you the option of running up to 16 hours. These are one of the best new gift products for this winter, and all orders ship free over $99. The gloves are $339, the sock covers $359 and the vests $359, all of which are less than many top-quality competitors. Julbo offers it top shelf photocromatic Reactiv lenses in an array of goggle sizes and styles Perfect Goggles for Every Condition: In recent years goggles with interchangeable lenses have become ubiquitous, but while the technology for swapping has gotten better, it’s still a pain to carry an extra pair of lenses, which are subject to damage and scratching, then take off your gloves and goggles and swap the lenses when light conditions change - and maybe change again and again. I have more than a dozen pairs of goggles and have in the past few seasons really embraced photochromatic lenses, those that lighten or darken automatically based on the light conditions. Like all other technology, photochromatic has gotten better and better, and venerable European optical manufacturer Julbo has long been the leader in this field. Their Reactiv lenses now cover an astonishingly broad array of conditions, from bright sunlight on bluebird days to the tricky flat end of day light that conceals hazards in the snow. One pair of goggles for all conditions, continuous high performance with no effort, made from quality materials and offered in several sizes for different faces and helmets. I recommend the frameless style that offers maximum field of vision, such as the Lightyear or Razor Edge, which also comes with a ventilation system to prevent fogging. The one-of-a-kind component design of Dahu ski boots has made them a cult choice for those seeking ... [+] comfort and warmth. Dahu Ski Boots: For most skiers, there is no best brand of boot, there’s the boot that fits you best. But there’s a vocal minority in the ski world who just can’t find any boots they feel are comfortable, and these folks just suffer winter after winter to enjoy the sport they love. But they might not have to, and if you know anyone struggling with comfort and fit boot issues, consider Dahu, a niche brand that makes a style of boot radically different from the competition, one that has developed a cult following. They make just two core models, one for men and one for women, both featuring their one-of-a-kind removable shell design. Each comes in three variations of stiffness and fit designed respectively for casual, intermediate and more advanced skiers ($889- $989). In its extensive review, Gear Junkie wrote “there are a lot of people out there who will fall head over heels in love with them.” Dahu was launched in Switzerland about 15 years ago to reinvent the ski boot industry and is known for being very comfortable and very warm. The system is two parts, a warm inner boot lining that can be worn alone - even to walk to the lifts, a big plus when you’re not staying slopeside - that slides into a separate three-piece hard shell. The liner also has the option to be custom heat molded to your feet. When unassembled, the walking aspect is unparalleled, when completed the boot is extremely comfortable, and it skis well enough go handle almost all resort skiing. At the end of the day, you can take the shells off and segue right to après. The boots are perfect for all green and blue and most black terrain, and the people who wouldn’t be interested are the most advanced, high-performance skiers, but those are the folks you wouldn’t consider gifting boots to anyway. The beauty and apres ski function of the Tecovas goat suede shirt jacket speaks for itself. Ultimate Après Wear: Most recreational skiers spend between 3 and 6 hours a day on the slopes. That mean most of your ski vacation is spent doing other things, such as eating, shopping, or of course, celebrating après ski happy hour. There’s a certain mix of casualness, ruggedness, warmth and outdoorsiness that defines the best après ski clothing, and I can’t think of a better example than this stunning overshirt of supple yet gorgeous goat suede from Tecovas. The company is best known as the leader in high quality direct to consumer western and cowboy boots, and those are also great gifts, but this is a one-of-a-kind statement piece that will turn heads in any mountain town. The Tecovas Goat Suede Après Shirt has a Western style, brass snaps, and comes in two colors, both eye popping ($450). Ski Town Footwear: For the same reasons given in the entry above, you need good winter footwear for any ski trip since so much of your time is spent not wearing ski boots. It is winter, and often snowy or slushy so you need something warm, waterproof and safe, with good traction and ideally, good looking. France’s Salomon has long been a leader in both ski equipment and athletic footwear, making the most popular trail running and winter trail shoes on the market, and I wear their Outblast Boots for ski trips, après ski and winter hiking. The Thinsulate insulation and a winter insole between you and the snow keeps you warm. They use the company’s proprietary ClimaSalomon waterproof fabric and an aggressive Contragip outsole gives maximum traction on wet, muddy or snow-covered surfaces. Offered in two colors, this combination of form and function makes them perfect ski town (or city!) winter wear ($145). If someone on your list needs a helmet, it's hard to do better than the new Smith Method MIPS Smith MIPS Method Helmet: Smith is the premier ski helmet company, and no one should buy a helmet that does not include MIPS, a third-party licensed technology that improves head protection. MIPS can be found in many brands, but after trying several other companies I’ve come back to Smith, and the company’s newest top of the line offering is the Method MIPS helmet also featuring Koroyd impact technology to crumple, absorb, and protect. The unisex freeride style helmet has a low profile, clean styling, and all the features you could want in protection and performance. These include eight fixed vents for consistent airflow, goggle compatible ventilation system for fog-free lenses, and removable ear pads for form fitting comfort. The Method has Smith’s self-adjusting Lifestyle Fit System that flexes to match the shape of the head for ultimate comfort and is available in a Round Contour Fit to accommodate rounder head shapes. It is compatible with Aleck™ audio systems (sold separately) and comes in nine colors and graphics ($140). There's no better way to carry skis than the Thule Roundtrip Ski Bag. Have Skis Will Travel: If you know someone who takes their skis with them when they travel, and most serious skiers do, this is a perfect gift. Ski bags are notoriously cheap and flimsy, with many not holding up over the years but most importantly, not protecting pricey gear. Thule has long been the gold standard in all things automotive sports rack related, ski carriers, bike carriers, kayak carriers, cargo boxes, etc. But a few years ago they got into luggage, and it is awesome. The Thule Roundtrip Ski Bag was rated the number one ski bag on the market for 2023 by Travel + Leisure magazine, and holds two pairs of skis easily, plus has a unique S-shaped zipper opening for easy access, internal zippered gear pocket, padded divider, multiple grab handles, and high-quality wheels that make it easy to roll. This bag will last for many years to come. ($299). The BCA 2024 Avalanche Safety Kit is great for anyone who skis out of bounds Don’t Go Out Without It: Recent years have seen an enormous increase in participation in backcountry and out of bounds skiing and snowboarding, including ski touring with alpine touring gear or split boards and skins. Even at “regular” ski resorts this has increased dramatically with many resorts following the lead of Jackson Hole and opening gates into ungroomed “side country” wilderness. Then there are heli-skiing and cat-skiing operations around the world. For all of these variations on traditional lift-served resort skiing, it is an absolute must to carry avalanche protection, including at a minimum an avalanche locator beacon transceiver, shovel and probe. This stuff is not optional, it’s like a seatbelt in your car, a must have. If you know anyone who plans to ski beyond the resort boundaries or in the woods at home, they need this stuff. Backcountry Access (BCA) has long been a leader in snow safety gear, and their turnkey 2024 Backcountry Access Tracker 4 Avalanche Rescue Package puts all these crucial elements together in one turnkey purchase (Tracker 4 beacon with harness, foldable shovel, foldable probe). This winter, give the gift of safety. ($460) Vermont's Skida makes the most popular hats in winter sports and its new Chateau collection is ... [+] perfect for apres and all sorts of ski town activities. Skida: Launched by a college ski racer in Vermont, Skida has become one of the most popular brands in all of outdoor gear, known for its instantly recognizable, stylish, high performance beanie style hats that can easily be worn under ski helmets but are also perfect for après, ski town wear and all outdoor activities, from Nordic skiing to winter hiking to sitting around a bonfire. The latest new offering is the “dressier” Chateau Collection, with the same fit as Skida’s flagship Alpine Hat, but made of a warmer quilted Polartec Jersey, featuring a removable faux-fur pom. Made in USA and in five colors ($44). PS, Skida also make really cool winter bandanas for dogs! It's hard to get more ski jacket for your money than Helly Hansen's Alpha 4.0 and Aphelia models. Stay Warm, Dry - And Sustainable: One of the most iconic jackets in all of skiing just got better. Norway’s Helly Hansen has been one of outdoor gear’s greatest innovators for decades, protecting sailors, skiers and adventurers - they invented the now ubiquitous entire wicking base layer and layering system, and have brought in many of the common technologies. I have top shelf outdoor and winter clothing from just about every major manufacture there is, a one-man arsenal of outdoor clothing, and my go-to choice in ski gear is Helly Hansen. The Alpha 4.0 is their bestselling jacket, but it just got an upgrade, and is now more earth friendly and sustainable, made from Ocean Bound Plastic. Made of Helly Tech Professional fabric with PrimaLoft’s high-end Black Eco insulation and 2-layer construction, the Alpha is waterproof, windproof, highly breathable and warm - but not too warm. One of the best features in Helly Hansen jackets is the company’s proprietary H2Flow system with adjustable zipper venting, and the Alpha has this. With a sharpened and articulated fit, the jacket delivers maximum freedom of movement. It also has the company’s signature cellphone Life Pocket, insulated with same AeroGel NASA uses to keep technology warm in space. On earth, it keeps your phone battery working longer in cold weather, something many skiers don’t consider until their phone goes dead. This is pretty much the perfect ski jacket - at a very reasonable price - with a detachable, helmet-compatible hood, ski pass pocket, stretch powder skirt, wrist gaiters with thumb holes, and it comes in 7 colors. For women, check out the Alphelia ($475). Merino wool base layers are a perfect gift for any skier. Icebreaker: Technology is great, but the ultimate outdoor recreation fabric was made centuries ago by Mother Nature, and that is merino wool. It wicks, is warmer by weight then synthetics, it’s comfier and unlike just about every imitation version, it doesn’t stink after wearing. It’s also highly durable and totally sustainable. Merino wool has roared back to become a go-to luxury material in outdoor clothing, but its very best use is as a base layer against your skin, where all the great properties achieve their maximum potential. New Zealand’s Icebreaker has always been the Rolls Royce of the outdoor clothing merino business, and their stuff is so well made that I am still using pieces I picked up on my first ski trip to New Zealand two decades ago. Fortunately, it is now widely available in the U.S., and for anyone who skis or snowboards, male or female, casual or avid, base layers from Icebreaker are easy, can’t-miss gifts. They make six different weights and a wide variety of long and short sleeve shirts, long underwear, all sorts of things. For example, a long sleeve tee shirt with half zipper neck starts around a hundred bucks. There’s nobody active who won’t love this stuff.","['canada', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'switzerland', 'france', 'moldova', 'not found', 'australia', 'norway', 'brazil', 'newzealand', 'newzealand', 'finland', 'finland', 'us']",us,True,True

Then he noticed the heat signature of a person moving across it, digging frantically in the churned up snow. “I got on the radio,” Gardet remembers, “and I said to dispatch: ‘There must be someone alive under there.’” As an experiencedpisteurin the French ski resort of Val Thorens, it’s Gardet’s job to keep the slopes safe. But that day he had his work cut out. “It had been snowing heavily the evening before and through the night, so we’d had a lot of calls about avalanches,” he remembers. As part of a newly launched pilot scheme, he and his colleague had been responding to some of these calls using the latest addition to their slope-safety toolbox: a DJI Matrice 210 drone. “Of course, the majority of the time, there’s nothing; the avalanches are nowhere near people,” Gardet says. But in the case of this particular slide, off the back of a 2,804-meter-high peak called Pointe de la Masse, the drone instantly proved its worth. From receiving the initial radio alert to having “eyes” on the debris, Gardet estimates that the scouting mission took less than a minute—far less than it would to survey an avalanche using traditional methods. The closest pisteurs were dispatched in double-quick time, and less than seven minutes after he’d raised the alarm they’d pulled the grateful skier, a 70-year-old Belgian man, out of the snow. Val Thorens’ pioneering drone program—launched in 2019, but still the only one of its kind—is just one of the ways that skiers throughout the Alps are embracing new technology to meet the rising threat of avalanches. With the climate crisis causing increasingly wild swings in winter temperatures, slides are becoming harder to predict, according to Patrick Nairz of the European Avalanche Warning Services (EAWS). “It’s become more challenging for avalanche forecasters, the situation right now,” he says. “You don’t see those long cold periods so often anymore, and then you see more often rain high up, which leads to development of weak layers in the snowpack.” At the same time, the number of people skiing in uncontrolled backcountry terrain, where avalanches are most likely, has exploded in the past 20 years. Wider skis, which float better in powder snow, have made it easier for less-experienced skiers to venture off the beaten piste, and although the nature of exploring outside resort boundaries means that data on participant numbers is difficult to come by, Nairz guesses that in Austria, where he’s based, “there are something like five to 10 times more [backcountry skiers] than 20 years ago.”Equipment sales figures also indicate an upward trend. In the US, sales of touring gear, which allows skiers to explore where there are no lifts, have grownexponentially, making it the fastest-growing segment of the market in the past decade. The discipline was given a further boost during the outdoor exercise boom of the pandemic, with sales of backcountry accessoriesup 150 percent, according to Snowsports Industries America, a research body. In Europe, where most ski lifts were closed for the best part of two winters, many shops sold out of ski touring equipment. These factors might be expected to combine into a perfect storm. But despite the growing unpredictability of winter and the increase in backcountry skiers, the number of avalanche fatalities in Europe has remained largely unchanged.EAWS datashows that although yearly death tolls fluctuate, the 10-year mean average has stayed static since the mid-’90s. “Yes it’s more or less the same,” says Patrick Nairz, “and if you check the last 40 years, or the last 20 years, there’s actually a downward trend.”Various technologies have helped play their part in this, he believes, not least improvements in the avalanche forecasting that he and his colleagues undertake. “In the beginning, you just had some observers outside in the field who dug pits to look at snow profiles and conducted stability tests. Then they called by phone and they told you about the snow in that spot,” he says. These days, however, forecasters work with sophisticated snowpack simulation models, allowing them to predict risks with increasing accuracy all over the Alps.","['germany', 'austria', 'us']",us,True,False

On Saturday, inductees returned to the Great Hall for a chat with fans. Then, on Sunday, the members will receive their Hall of Fame jackets in a special ceremony ahead of the annual Legends game, where 2023 honorees Pierre Turgeon and Caroline Ouellette will skate for a team captained by 2012 inductee Adam Oates and coached by 2023 inductee Ken Hitchcock against a squad led by 2011 honoree Joe Nieuwendyk that will feature 2023 inductee Henrik Lundqvist in net.

Mike Vernon, now 60, retired in 2002 after 781 games and a pair of Stanley Cup wins with the Calgary Flames in 1989 and the Detroit Red Wings in 1997. Tom Barrasso, 58, won back-to-back Cups with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1991 and 1992. He played 777 games before calling it a day in 2003.

(Photo by Brian Winkler/Getty Images) Selected first overall by the Buffalo Sabres in 1987, Pierre Turgeon collected 1,327 points over 1,294 NHL games with six different teams over the course of his 19-year career. Known for his nose for the net, his best season came with the New York Islanders in 1992-93, when he put up 58 goals and 134 points and was named the winner of the Lady Byng Trophy. Turgeon, 54, is one of just three players ever to record at least 300 points with three different franchises (Buffalo Sabres, New York Islanders, St. Louis Blues). The other two are Joe Mullen (Flames, Blues, Penguins) and Mark Recchi (Flyers, Penguins, Canadiens). Ken Hitchcock Winner of a Stanley Cup with the Dallas Stars in 1999 and the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year with the St. Louis Blues in 2012, Hitchcock is a rare example of a successful NHL head coach who didn’t play hockey at a high level himself. Now 71, Hitchcock worked his way up to the NHL through junior hockey. With the Kamloops Blazers, he won a WHL title and two coach of the year honors, as well as CHL coach of the year in 1990, before he joined the Philadelphia Flyers in an assistant’s role. In 1993, he transitioned to a head-coaching role in the now-defunct International Hockey League, which set him up to become a mid-season replacement for the Stars during the 1995-96 season. Less than four years later, he had his Stanley Cup ring. And his NHL career continued for 22 years, with stops on five different teams, before he retired in 2019. Hitchcock’s 849 career wins rank him fourth all-time among NHL coaches, behind only Scotty Bowman (1,244), Joel Quenneville (969) and Barry Trotz (914). His career winning percentage of .531 also ranks him fifth all-time among coaches with at least 1,000 NHL games on their resumes. Pierre Lacroix After starting his career as a player agent, Pierre Lacroix took over as general manager of the Quebec Nordiques in 1994, one year before the franchise relocated to Denver. Less than two months after the Colorado Avalanche first hit the ice, Lacroix engineered the blockbuster trade that brought legendary goaltender Patrick Roy to the team. The elite stopper augmented an already strong talent base, leading to Stanley Cup wins in 1996 and 2001.

LUCKNOW, India — Rescuers were digging through dirt and parts of a collapsed road tunnel Monday to reach 40 workers trapped by a landslide at the construction project in northern India. All of the construction workers are safe, police officer Prashant Kumar said, adding that they have been supplied with oxygen and water. He said the rescuers had established contact with the trapped individuals. Thecollapse occurred Sundayin Uttarakhand, a mountainous state dotted with Hindu temples that attracts many pilgrims and tourists. Massive construction of buildings and roadways have taken place in recent years in Uttarakhand. The trapped workers were building part of the Chardham all-weather road, a flagship federal government project connecting variousHindu pilgrimage sites. The number of workers trapped was confirmed Monday by Rajesh Pawar, the project manager at the Navyug Construction Company, which is overseeing the construction of the tunnel. Rescue efforts began Sunday, with authorities pumping oxygen through a pipe into the collapsed section of the tunnel to help workers breathe. ""The team has progressed 15 meters (yards) into the tunnel, with an additional 35 meters (yards) yet to cover,"" Kumar said, adding that more than 150 rescuers had used drilling equipment and excavators to clear debris through the night. The collapsed portion of the 4.5-kilometer (2.7-mile) tunnel is about 200 meters (500 feet) from the entrance, officials told the Press Trust of India news agency. In January, Uttarakhand state authorities moved hundreds of people to temporary shelters after a temple collapsed and cracks appeared in over 600 houses because ofthe sinking of landin and around Joshimath town in the region.","['india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india']",us,False,False

A portion of the 4.5km-long passage between Silkyara and Dandalgaon, which is being built on the Brahmakhal-Yamunotri National Highway, collapsed on Sunday, leaving dozens trapped inside. The tunnel is part of the federal government’s ambitious project to improve “all-weather” connectivity in the Himalayan state, which is known for harsh weather conditions, frequent landslides and snow avalanches. Around 150 rescue personnel from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), SDRF, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and Border Roads Organization (BRO) have been mobilized to rescue the people. “The rescue operation is happening on a war footing.

Officials were finally able to establish contact with the trapped laborers through walkie talkies several hours after the accident occurred, according to Indian media. The workers confirmed that there had been no casualties and asked for food. Food packets and water are being provided through pipes, local officials said. The ‘Char Dhaam’ project includes the construction of 900km of national highways to connect all of Uttarakhand state and is estimated to cost around 120 billion Indian rupees ($1.5 billion). The Indian government expects the new infrastructure to improve the livelihoods of the local population, increasing trade and tourism. The project will provide all-weather connectivity to key centers of pilgrimage in the Himalayan state. In 2021, a deadly incident occurred in another part of the state, when more than three dozen workers were trapped inside a tunnel at the Tapovan Vishnugad Hydropower Plant in the Chamoli district, following massive flash floods caused by a glacier burst. The disaster claimed more than 80 lives and 200 were reported missing.","['india', 'india', 'india']",ru,False,False

Chopra had resigned last year as the chairman of a Supreme Court-appointed high-powered committee on Char Dham all-weather road expressing disappointment over the apex court order limiting the panel's jurisdiction to only two 'non defence' stretches of the project. For development in the Himalayas , it is necessary to first address ecological concerns, he said, adding sustainable development demands approaches that are both geologically and ecologically sound. ""Unless this balance is achieved such horrific incidents will continue to happen,"" Chopra told PTI. A portion of the tunnel between Silkyara and Dandalgaon on the Brahmakhal-Yamunotri national highway collapsed in the early hours of Sunday. Rescue operations are being carried out to evacuate 40 labourers trapped inside. Some experts are also unhappy with the methods being adopted for the construction of Char Dham all-weather highways, especially the widening of roads. Former advisor to the State Planning Commission, Harshapati Uniyal, said, ""These all-weather roads are a tragedy for Uttarakhand, especially because of the wrong techniques being used for their widening. The river valley alignment cannot be considered safe. If you disturb the slopes, disasters like landslides are inevitable."" In the first decade after the formation of Uttarakhand, the number of natural disasters was very less. In 2002, 36 people died in a cloudburst in Ghansali area of Tehri district, while in 2003, a landslide from Varunavat mountain in Uttarkashi town caused huge devastation. However, after 2010, the number of natural disasters increased significantly. The Kedarnath disaster of June 2013 was of an unprecedented magnitude killing thousands of people, Uniyal said. During monsoon, small and big disasters keep occurring in the state from time to time. During this period, cracks also appeared on Kedarnath and Badrinath highways due to which traffic was disrupted. The Char Dham road project also suffered damage at many places in the Garhwal region. Quoting Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, Uniyal said there was a loss of about Rs 1,000 crore in the state this monsoon. In the landslide-zone map presented by ISRO , Rudraprayag district has been shown to be very vulnerable to disasters but the government has not taken any steps towards reducing them, he alleged. Kedarnath Dham is in Rudraprayag district. Earlier this year, a case of land subsidence was also reported in Joshimath where some residents blamed NTPC's 520 MW Tapovan-Vishnugad hydroelectric project for the problem. Uniyal said due to the underground tunnel of the project passing near the hill town, cracks had appeared in the buildings and roads of the city. Social activist Shivanand Chamoli , who has been vocal on these issues, said considering the sensitivity of the Himalayas, development projects should be examined from every aspect before permission is given. ""If development work is carried out in a haphazard manner, disasters will definitely occur,"" Chamoli said. ","['india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india']",in,True,True

About 25 search and rescue team members deployed to search for the hiker as a severe snowstorm blew in, according to the news release. Around 12:42 a.m. Thursday, a team member spotted footprints in 6 to 8 inches of freshly fallen snow, and began to follow them, according to the news release. “This team continued to follow the footprints until they came upon an unusual looking rock” at approximately 2 a.m., the release said. “Upon further investigation it was determined it was not a rock but the subject sitting upright in a fetal position covered in snow.” The hiker was “alive but very hypothermic,” and rescuers spent three hours warming them up before starting the process of getting them down the gully, the search and rescue team said. Initially, ropes were used to lower the hiker one section at a time until they said they thought they could walk and made their own way down the remaining stretch of the slope to an ambulance waiting to check them out, the rescue team said.

Authorities have warned of a life-threatening storm surge and the possibility of landslides as heavy rain pelts the area. The storm has already begun to weaken as it moves inland. David Hall arrived at the Princess Mundo Imperial resort in Acapulco for a work conference hours before Otis made landfall. He told the BBC that the building had been damaged by the wind and rain. He said the hotel room windows buckled from the force of the winds and smashed, sucking items out of the room. Mr Hall, who is from the Mexican city of Colima, roughly 600km (372 miles) from Acapulco, said the building ""shivered"" as if an earthquake was happening. He and hundreds of other guests at the hotel have been hunkering down together while the worst of the hurricane passes. ""A lot of people are scared,"" said Mr Hall. A hurricane warning is in effect for a 350km-long stretch of coastline between the coastal towns of Zihuatanejo and Punta Maldonado in the state of Guerrero. Power outages have already been reported in Guerrero, according to Mexico's civil protection body. School classes across the state were cancelled in preparation for the storm's arrival. Unverified videos posted online show damage to a hospital in Acapulco and flooding outside the Copacabana hotel. Mexico's national water agency said that waves of up to 10 metres high (32ft) were expected on the coasts of Guerrero and in western Oaxaca state. Possible mudslides have also been forecast. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said there was ""material damage and blocked roads"" and that there were landslides on the highway to Acapulco. He said there were no reports of deaths but cautioned that authorities were struggling to get updates. ""The hurricane is still affecting the area and communications are completely down,"" he said. Officials said that it was difficult to gauge the extent of the damage in Acapulco, which has a population of around 780,000, given poor communications. The NHC also said that Otis was expected to produce up to 20in (51cm) of rainfall on Friday across Guerrero and western coastal areas of the neighbouring Oaxaca state. Scientists said the speed with which Otis intensified from a tropical storm into a category five hurricane - the highest level of storm - on Tuesday was rare. It broke the record for the fastest intensification rate over a 12-hour period in the Eastern Pacific, gaining 80mph in that time, according to meteorologist Philip Klotzbach. Parts of Mexico's Pacific coastline have already seen significant flooding earlier this month after Tropical Storm Max hit. Local media reported two deaths as a result of the storm in Guerrero. A few days later, one man was reported killed after powerful Hurricane Lidia made landfall in the state of Nayarit, north-west of Guerrero.","['mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'brazil']",gb,False,False

Let’s not just limit ourselves to facts. Dive deep to know: What are the pollutants in our air and how they impact health? WHO report shows India has made improvements, but could miss its 2035 target to eliminate the TB. What are the challenges in making India earthquake prepared? What are the provisions that grant legislators immunity from prosecution? And more… — Following a few days of high levels of air pollution inDelhi, light showers of rain on Thursday night (November 9) and on Friday led to clearer skies and better air quality. — In early November, theAir Quality Index (AQI)in the region rose to as high as 471, coming under the category of ‘Severe’. — The AQI measures the quantity of eight pollutants in the atmosphere and converts it into a number for ease of understanding. —Rain washes away dust, but not for long. — Some constituent pollutants measured by the AQI – such asOzone, Sulphur dioxide and other pollutants– are not as easily washed away. —PM 2.5 and PM 10can, however, be washed out to a significant extent if it rains for a long period of time. JUST FYI — An earlier article from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) explained the process thus:“As a raindrop falls through the atmosphere, it can attract tens to hundreds of tiny aerosol particles to its surface before hitting the ground. The process by which droplets and aerosols attract is coagulation, a natural phenomenon that can act to clear the air of pollutants like soot, sulfates, and organic particles.” — Therefore, prolonged rain can help reduce air pollution in a limited sense, with its impact focused on particulate matter – just some of the pollutants that are part of our atmosphere. Point to ponder:What are thepollutants in our airand how they impact health? (Thought process: — So, PM 10 and PM 2.5 are smaller than 10 and 2.5 microns in their diameter, respectively. — One micron is about a thousandth of a millimetre and this tiny size has a role to play in how they impact human health. — The finer the particles are, the more difficult it gets to protect oneself from them. — Due to their size, the PM 2.5 particles can easily bypass the nose and throat and can enter the circulatory system. — The particles can also lead to chronic diseases such as asthma, heart attack, bronchitis and other respiratory problems. — Byproducts of emissions from factories, vehicular pollution, construction activities and road dust, such particles are not dispersed and stay suspended in the air that we breathe. — Short-term exposure to high levels of NO2 can aggravate respiratory diseases like asthma, and lead to other problems such as coughing or difficulty in breathing (according to US EPA). — Long-term exposure may also contribute to the development of asthma and could increase susceptibility to respiratory infections. — AsThe Indian Expressreported last week, exposure to NO2, even for a short duration (between zero and seven days), leads to an increase in the number of emergency room visits by 53 per cent, according to a large study by AIIMS, Delhi. — However, surface-level ozone is among the most significant air pollutants. It is formed by the reaction of atmospheric pollutants in the presence of sunlight. — According to a 2017 study published in the International Journal of Medical Public Health, “With increase in surface ozone levels, there is likelihood of an increase in risk of hospital admissions for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) and the number of cardiovascular and respiratory deaths.” — Additional sources are industrial processes and natural sources such as volcanoes. — As with other gases, SO2 exposure is harmful to the cardiovascular system and can lead to the development of respiratory illnesses. SO2 can also react with other compounds to form particulate matter. — “At high concentrations, gaseous SOx can harm trees and plants by damaging foliage and decreasing growth,” EPA states. — While gaseous ammonia is a natural part of Earth’s nitrogen cycle, excess ammonia is harmful to plants and reduces air and water quality. “In the troposphere – the lowest, most dense part of the atmosphere where all weather takes place and where people live – ammonia gas reacts with nitric and sulfuric acids to form nitrate-containing particles. Those particles contribute to aerosol pollution that is damaging to human health. Ammonia gas can also fall back to Earth and enter lakes, streams and oceans, where it contributes to harmful algal blooms and “dead zones” with dangerously low oxygen levels,” the study said. — Important sources of environmental contamination come from mining, smelting, manufacturing and even recycling activities, according to the WHO. — Also, young children are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning because they absorb four to five times as much ingested lead as adults from a given source. — “Children who survive severe lead poisoning may be left with permanent intellectual disability and behavioural disorders. At lower levels of exposure that cause no obvious symptoms, lead is now known to produce a spectrum of injury across multiple body systems,” the WHO notes. — If CO levels are high enough, a person may become unconscious and die. — Long-term exposure has been linked with an increased risk of heart disease.

(a) It was launched by the central government in 2014 as part of the Swachh Bharat campaign. (b) It transforms complex air quality data of various pollutants into a single number (index value), nomenclature and colour. (c) When AQI is in the ‘very poor’ category Stage 1 of GRAP is activated. (d) There are six categories of AQI. — A state of emergency has been declared in Iceland, after a swarm of 800 earthquakes rocked the island country’s southwestern Reykjanes peninsula in under 14 hours on Friday (November 10). — Around 1,400 earthquakes were measured in the previous 24 hours, and over 24,000 have been recorded in the peninsula since late October. — The most powerful of these quakes had a magnitude of 5.2, and hit about 40 km from Reykjavík, Iceland’s capital, on Friday. What is happening in Iceland? — Iceland is located on theMid-Atlantic Ridge, technically the longest mountain range in the world, but on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. —The ridge separates the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates — making it a hotbed of seismic activity. — On average, Iceland experiences around 26000 earthquakes a year according to Perlan, a Reykjavik-based natural history museum. — Most of them are imperceptible and unconcerning. But sometimes, a swarm of earthquakes — a sequence of mostly small earthquakes with no identifiable mainshock — is a troubling precursor to a volcanic eruption. — According to scientists belonging to the Iceland Met Office (IMO), that is exactly what is happening now. How can earthquake swarms be portents for volcanic activity? — Deep under the Earth’s surface, intense heat melts rocks to form magma, a thick flowing substance lighter than solid rock. This drives it upwards and most of it gets trapped in magma chambers deep underground. — Over time, this viscous liquid cools and solidifies once again. However, a tiny fraction erupts through vents and fissures on the surface, causing volcanic eruptions. — Now, the movement of magma close to Earth’s surface exerts force on the surrounding rock, which often causes earthquake swarms. — Now, the underground movement of magma does not necessarily lead to an eruption. But closer it gets to the surface, more likely an eruption is, and more frequent symptomatic earthquake swarms get. JUST FYI — After the ongoing spell of seismic activity began, IMO scientists on October 27 said that it was “the response of the crust to the stress changes induced by continued magmatic inflow at depth beneath the Fagradalsfjall volcanic system.” — Fagradalsfjall lies about 40 km to the southwest of Reykjavík and is the “world’s newest baby volcano.” It had been dormant for eight centuries before erupting in 2021, 2022 and 2023. Since the 2021 eruption, tourists from across the world have swarmed (sic) to Fagradalsfjall to catch a glimpse of moltenlavaflowing gushing onto Earth’s surface. — Iceland is home to some of the most active volcanoes in the world, with volcanos being an integral part of the island’s landscape and culture. — Currently, it boasts of 33 active volcanoes which have erupted over 180 times in the past 1,000 years. According to United States Geological Service, active volcanos are those which have “erupted within the Holocene (the current geologic epoch, which began at the end of the most recent ice age about 11,650 years ago),” or which have “the potential to erupt again in the future.” — One of Iceland’s most famous volcanoes is Eyjafjallajökull. In 2010, this volcano erupted and caused a massive ash cloud to spread across Europe. The ash cloud disrupted air travel for weeks and caused billions of dollars in damage. Other famous volcanoes include Hekla, Grímsvötn, Hóluhraun, and Litli-Hrútur (part of the Fagradalsfjall system). Point to ponder:What are thechallenges in making India earthquakeprepared? (Thought process:Currently, India’s policy on earthquake preparedness operates primarily at the scale of structural details. Guided by the National Building Codes, this includes specifying dimensions of the structural members — columns, beams, etc. — and details of the reinforcements that join these elements together. While scientifically sound, this view on earthquake preparedness is myopic. First, it ignores the buildings that were constructed before such codes were published in 1962. Such buildings form a large part of our cities.Second, it assumes infallibility in the processes of enforcement — relying only on penalisation and illegalities.Third, it treats earthquakes as a problem of individual buildings — as if they exist and behave in complete isolation from their urban context. Excerpt fromFahad Zuberi’s Opinion pieceforThe Indian Express) 2. MCQ: Fagradalsfjall system refers to: (a) group of islands (b) earthquake belt (c) irrigation system (d) volcanic system — Although several positive strides such as increased access to treatment and more accurate molecular diagnostics have been made by India towards the goal of eliminating tuberculosis by 2025, five years ahead of the global target, it continues to have the highest incidence of the bacterial infection. India accounts for 27 per cent of the total TB cases in the world, according to the recently released Global TB Report 2023 by the World Health Organisation. — The report noted two positive trends for India.One,there was an increase in reporting of TB cases, crossing even the pre-pandemic high with 24.2 lakh cases in 2022.Two,the coverage of treatment for the infection increased to 80%. — The most important data point for India, however, was mortality due to TB. What does the 2023 report say about mortality in India? —A sudden drop in mortality due to TB was noted in the 2023 report.This was owing to the WHO report accepting India’s Sample Registration System dataset as the basis for the calculations instead of the Global Burden of Disease report. — With the change in dataset, India’s TB mortality dropped from 4.94 lakhs in 2021 to 3.31 lakhs in 2022. This resulted in a reduction in India’s contribution towards global mortality from 36 per cent in the previous years to 26 per cent in 2022. — The Union Health Ministry in a statement said that the data in Global TB Report 2022, which presented the figures from 2021, was published as “interim” with an understanding that the inter-government agency will work with the technical team of the ministry to finalise the figure. — India presented newer evidence, the in-country mathematical modelling for estimating burden, and data from the government’sNi-Kshay portalthat captures data for the entire duration between a person being diagnosed with TB and completing their treatment. “There were more than 50 meetings between the technical teams of WHO and the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare… The WHO team intensively reviewed all data presented and not only accepted, but also appreciated the efforts made by the country. This year, the Global TB Report has acknowledged and published the revised estimates…” the statement said. How many people get TB in India? — Nearly 28.2 lakh people got TB in India in 2022, meaning one person gets TB every 11 seconds in India, according to the report. India’s contribution to the global burden is 27%, which is down one percentage point from the previous year’s 28%. — What is more important is that there has been an increase in reporting of TB cases. The estimated number of cases in a country is based on a mathematical model, and there is a gap between that and the number of people who actually get diagnosed and put on treatment in a country. — The Global TB report 2023 shows thatreporting of cases has improved in India, going beyond the pre-pandemic levels.This is despite the fact that India, along with Indonesia and the Philippines, accounted for 67 per cent decline in reporting of TB cases globally during the pandemic.India reported 24.2 lakh cases in 2022 similar to the 24.04 lakh cases reported during 2019. — The report also noted that India was the only country to have completed a National TB prevalence survey since 2019. “The survey was started in 2019, interrupted for several months in 2020 and then completed in 2021. Results from this survey were a key input to the estimates of TB incidence in India published in this report,” the WHO report said. What does the report say about coverage of TB treatment in India? — The report acknowledged an increase in coverage of TB treatment in India, increasing by 19 per cent over the previous year. In fact, India was among only four countries among the 30 high-burden countries in the world that were able to achieve more than 80 per cent treatment coverage. — Globally, the report notes, the treatment coverage in 2022 reached the pre-pandemic levels of 70%. — The Union Health Ministry said that India has undertaken several initiatives towards TB elimination including active case finding, scaling up of more accurate molecular testing to block level, screening services made available through the health and wellness centres, and engagement of the private sector as well. — The government also said that the Ni-kshay Mitra where people provide additional nutritional support to TB patients has also resulted in the adoption of over 11 lakh TB patients. This support is in addition to government’s R500 nutritional support. JUST FYI What is India’s TB elimination target? — India has set a target of 2025 for eliminating TB in the country. The national strategic plan 2017-2025 sets the target of no more than 44 new TB cases per lakh population by 2025. The 2023 report pegs this number at 199 cases per lakh. Achieving this target is a big task as the plan had envisaged an incidence of only 77 cases per lakh population by 2023. — The programme also aims to reduce the mortality to 3 deaths per lakh population by 2025. Even with the WHO accepting the lowered estimates for India, this stands at 23 per lakh population. Point to ponder:WHO reportshows India has made improvements, but could miss its 2035 target to eliminate the TB. Discuss. (Thought Process: More than a fourth of the world’s TB patients live in India,according to the WHO report released on Tuesday.The country recorded a staggering 28 lakh cases in 2022. Nevertheless, the report finds cause for optimism in the reduction in TB mortality and incidence in the past eight years. It also acknowledges the improvements made by the country’s case detection system — remaining undiagnosed doesn’t just delay treatment for those with bacterial disease but also puts their contacts at risk of infection. The positive score on TB reporting is reassuring, given that surveillance programmes had taken a hit during the Covid years — case detection levels have rebounded to 2019 levels. However, the global health agency has also put in a caveat — it has not ruled out the possibility of several “new cases” being actually undiagnosed patients from the pandemic years. Medically, the greatest challenge is posed by the multi-drug resistant (MDR) variant of the disease. The WHO estimates that 1,19,000 new cases of this extremely virulent variety of TB emerge in India each year. However, the Indian TB programme manages to report a little over half of this. A growing body of scholarship testifies that inappropriate prescription, wrong dosage, poor quality of drugs and failure to complete the medications have precipitated India’s MDR TB epidemic. In recent times, experts have advocated the use of molecular diagnostics to treat contagious diseases such as TB. These tests were extensively used for Covid detection and they can be repurposed for TB diagnostics. The WHO, too, recommends molecular tests. However, the latest India-TB report shows that the traditional sputum smear test continues to be the predominant testing method in most parts of the country. Microscopy can at best detect half of MDR TB cases — that explains the high percentage of patients falling under the radar in the country. Excerpt fromEditorialofThe Indian Express) 3. MCQ: With reference to the latest WHO report on TB, consider the following statements: 1. More than a fourth of the world’s TB patients live in India. 2. It acknowledges the improvements made by the country’s case detection system. 3. India’s TB mortality dropped in 2022 (compared to 2021). Which of the above statement/s above is/are correct? (a) 1 and 2 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 3 only (d) 1, 2 and 3 WHY IN NEWS? — The Supreme Court issued guidelines on Thursday (November 9) to monitor the speedy disposal of criminal cases against Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs). — Among the guidelines formulated for the“expeditious disposal”of such cases, the court called on the chief justices of various high courts across the country to set up a “special bench” to review and monitor the progress of criminal cases against lawmakers. KEY TAKEAWAYS What is this case? — The directions were given by a CJI DY Chandrachud-led bench while acting on a plea filed by advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay. — The plea filed in August 2016 sought speedy disposal of cases involving lawmakers. It also sought a lifetime ban on convicted politicians, including sitting legislators, from contesting elections rather than subjecting them to the six-year ban, as laid down underSection 8(3) of the Representation of People Act, 1951. — Section 8 of the RP Act, 1951, mainly deals with the disqualification of lawmakers on conviction for certain offences. What does the RP Act say? — Introduced by Dr BR Ambedkar in the Parliament, the Representation of the People Act, 1951, provides for the conduct of elections to the houses of parliament and the legislatures of each state, the qualifications and disqualifications for membership of those houses, corrupt practices, and other offences taking place at or in connection with the elections. — Although there are several provisions that deal with disqualification under the RPA, Section 8 specifically deals with disqualification of legislators on conviction for offences like promoting enmity between two groups, bribery, and undue influence, along with hoarding, profiteering, or adulteration of food or drugs. — However, the provision that Upadhyay sought to replace with a “lifetime ban” in his plea was Section 8(3), which states, “A person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years shall be disqualified from the date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years since his release.” Essentially, this provision imposes a six-year ban on persons convicted of offences with a minimum two-year sentence. — While the top court in its ruling today addressed the first aspect of Upadhyay’s plea seeking speedy disposal of cases against MPs and MLAs, it kept open the issue of replacing the 6-year ban with a lifetime one. What did the court rule? — The bench, also comprising Justices PS Narasimha and Manoj Misra, said that the “confidence and trust of the constituency in their political representative” is necessary for the effective functioning of a parliamentary democracy. — Emphasising the impact of such cases on our“political democracy”,the court said that every effort should be made to take them up on priority and decide them expeditiously. — Following this, the bench laid down guidelines for monitoring the early disposal of cases against lawmakers.Among these was the registration of suo motu cases by the chief justices of various high courts across the country to monitor the quick disposal of pending criminal cases against legislators. — Adding that such cases can be heard by a CJ-led special bench or a bench designated by her, the court said that such cases can also be listed at regular intervals, if necessary. The special bench may also call upon the advocate general or prosecutor to assist the court, the Supreme Court said. — Stating that it would be difficult to lay down uniform guidelines for trial courts across the country to dispose of such cases, the court left it to the high court to devise measures to effectively monitor such cases. — Further, the court said that priority shall be given to cases against lawmakers that are punishable with death or life imprisonment. Besides this, cases punishable with 5 years imprisonment or more will also be prioritised. —The court also ruled that HCs can call upon the Principal District and Sessions Judge to take on the responsibility of allocating “subject cases” to such courts, as considered appropriate. The HCs can also ask the lower court judges to send reports at timely intervals, the court said. — Further, trial courts cannot adjourn such cases unless there are rare and compelling reasons for the same, the court said. — Sufficient infrastructure facilities and the adoption of technology should also be ensured for these designated courts by the principal district and session judges. — Besides this, the HCs were directed to create an “independent tab” on their website with district-wise information about the details of such cases, including the year, at what stage the proceedings are, etc. — However, this is not the first time that the apex court has dealt with the need for speedy disposal of criminal cases against MPs and MLAs. JUST FYI What are the other instances? In its 2015 ruling in“Public Interest Foundation vs. Union of India,”the top court directed that trials of sitting legislators facing charges against them for offences relating to Section 8 of the RP Act should be concluded “as speedily and expeditiously” as possible. Adding that the trial’s duration cannot exceed one year from the date on which the charges were framed, the court had also suggested conducting the trials on a “day-to-day” basis. Under extraordinary circumstances, if the trial isn’t concluded within a year, the court would have to submit a report to the HC CJ along with reasons for delay, the court said. Point to ponder:What are the provisions that grant legislators immunity from prosecution? (Thought process:Broadly, Article 105 of the Constitution deals with the “powers, privileges, etc. of the Houses of Parliament and of the members and committees thereof”. Article 105(2) states, “No member of Parliament shall be liable to any proceedings in any court in respect of any thing said or any vote given by him in Parliament or any committee thereof, and no person shall be so liable in respect of the publication by or under the authority of either House of Parliament of any report, paper, votes or proceedings.” In a nutshell, this provision exempts MPs from any legal action for any statement made or act done in the course of their duties. For example, a defamation suit cannot be filed for a statement made in the House. Additionally, this immunity extends to certain non-members, like the Attorney General of India or a Minister who may not be a member but speaks in the House. In cases where a member oversteps or exceeds the contours of admissible free speech, the Speaker of the House will deal with it, as opposed to the court. Meanwhile, Article 194(2) extends this immunity to MLAs and states, “No member of the Legislature of a State shall be liable to any proceedings in any court in respect of anything said or any vote given by him in the Legislature or any committee thereof, and no person shall be so liable in respect of the publication by or under the authority of a House of such a Legislature of any report, paper, votes, or proceedings.” In the present case, the court has to decide if the legal immunity enjoyed by parliamentarians extends to prosecution for demanding or taking a bribe.) 4. MCQ: Consider the following statements below: 1. Article 105 of the Constitution deals with the “powers, privileges, etc. Introduced by Rajendra Prasad in the Parliament, the Representation of the People Act, 1951, provides for the conduct of elections to the houses of parliament and the legislatures of each state, the qualifications and disqualifications for membership of those houses, corrupt practices, and other offences taking place at or in connection with the elections. Which of the above statement/s is/are correct? (a) 1 only (b) 2 only (c) Both 1 and 2 (d) Neither 1 nor 2 — On October 27, the long delayedSubansiri Lower Hydroelectric Projecton theborder of Arunachal Pradesh and Assamsuffered its latest setback after a large part of the hill on the left side of the dam collapsed into its reservoir. — The deposits blocked the only functional diversion tunnel and stopped the flow of water downstream of the dam into the Subansiri river, amajor tributary of the Brahmaputra. — Construction of the project, which when complete will be India’s largest, began in 2005, but suffered a long stoppage between December 2011 and September 2019 due to local opposition and major changes in the design of the dam. — After work resumed, the deadline for commissioning the first two of the project’s eight 250-MW units has been extended five times: to March 2021, August 2022, March 2023, June 2023, and now March 2024. How a dammed river flows? — Typically, once a location is selected for a dam, a temporary earthen barrier (coffer dam) and a few diversion tunnels are built immediately upstream to bypass the dam construction site. — Once the dam is ready, the diversion tunnels (DTs) are closed, and water starts to flow through the multiple spillways — which are gated holes in the dam wall that ensure regulated release. — In a hydel project, a set of tunnels are also built to carry water from the reservoir to the powerhouse. The water turns the turbines, and then goes back into the river. Once the power house is operational, this becomes the main path of the water, and the spillways are used occasionally. What happened at Subansiri? — On October 27, a spokesperson for the Subansiri Lower Project said the flow downstream was “highly reduced” — to an estimated 5-10 cubic metres per second (cumecs) — after a landslide “at about 11.30 am” blocked the only DT in use. “The dam spillway bay level is at 145 m [above] msl (mean sea level). At 1 pm, the water level reached 139 m msl. At the present river flow of 997 cubic m/sec, the water level of the reservoir is expected to reach 145 m msl this evening and the river will again flow through the spillway…normally,” the spokesperson said. The water eventually started flowing out of the spillways around 11 pm. — As of now, “three spillway gates are complete and the remaining six were to be ready by December. It was perhaps a mistake to depend on a single DT,” an engineer associated with the project said. The ‘mistake’ NHPC committed — The Central Electricity Authority (CEA), the statutory body that advises the government on policy relating to electricity systems, had recommended in April 2022 that the impact of the DTs on the slope stability of the project site should be examined. — NHPC Ltd, which is implementing the Subansiri Lower Project, ignored the recommendation. In April 2023, it said that “no more assessment of landslide hazards and their impact was needed”, and that “necessary stabilisation measures have been carried out”. What happens here onward? — A team of the NHPC’s board of directors, and top officials of the CEA and Geological Survey of India visited the site last week. The project will now focus on slope stabilisation, NHPC project consultant A N Mohammed said.Biswajit Basu, project director of NHPC, said, “We will complete the work before the (March 2024) deadline.” He declined to comment on how the spillway gates would be built, and the potential time and cost overruns. — The likely option would be to build a temporary sheet pile dyke — a metallic barrier with steel bracing — inside the reservoir to isolate the under-construction spillway gates, and to finish the work after the slope stabilisation process is over, a project official said. — Basu also declined to comment on the potential impact on the riverine ecosystem and aquatic life forms. “Whenever DTs are closed, the water level goes down. But a river is never dry and water levels anyway fall in the winter,” he said. — While the Subansiri’s lowest-ever winter discharge on NHPC records was 188 cumecs in 1979, for almost 12 hours on October 27, the flow went down to 5-10 cumecs. The project clearance conditions require Subansiri Lower to maintain a minimum downstream flow of 240 cumecs at all times. JUST FYI The site’s history of landslides — The landslide on October 27 was the sixth to hit the dam site since the CEA sounded the warning last April. Major landslides took place in June, September, and October 2022, and in April and September 2023. There had been landslides before the CEA’s alert as well — probably the reason why the CEA raised a flag in the first place. — “A landslide blocked the outlet of one diversion tunnel in 2020. Another tunnel wall collapsed last June. In all, four of the five diversion tunnels suffered damage, or were blocked or sealed over the last two years,” a project official said. — Yet, the project authority relied on the sole functional diversion tunnel to release water downstream, and to lower the dam reservoir level to complete the construction of the spillway gates. Point to ponder:What are thealternatives to hydropower? (Thought process:Micro hydro is a small-scale hydroelectric power generation system that typically generates up to 100 kilowatts (kW) of electricity. These systems use the energy of falling water to turn a turbine, which, in turn, generates electricity. They can be used for various applications, including powering homes, businesses, and small communities. Micro hydro systems are typically less expensive to build and maintain than large hydroelectric dams and have a smaller environmental footprint. They can be located even in inaccessible areas where it is difficult to transmit electricity from larger power stations, and they can provide a reliable source of energy to communities that are not connected to the grid. Micro hydro systems can be classified into two main types – run-of-river and storage systems. Run-of-river systems use the natural flow of water in a stream or river to generate electricity. In contrast, storage systems use a reservoir to store water and release it as needed to generate electricity. Micro hydro systems can be tailored to minimise the ecosystem’s negative impact and provide sustainable energy solutions. However, it’s important to note that even micro-hydropower projects can have some impact on the environment and local communities. A detailed assessment should be carried out to evaluate the potential impact before proceeding with the project. Excerpt fromAnjal Prakash’s OpinionforThe Indian Express) 5.

The slopes of this extinct volcano in eastern Uganda have become increasingly prone to such disasters as a result of climate change. The looming question: How do you help people find a safe new place to live?Isaac Kasamani/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The aftermath of a mudslide that ripped through villages on the foothills of Mount Elgon in 2012, killing at least 18 people. The looming question: How do you help people find a safe new place to live? Mount Elgon's red earth slopes are home to hundreds of thousands of people who eke out a living growing coffee and vegetables on small plots cleared from the forest. As climate change has made annual rains ever more intense, the deforested areas have become increasingly prone to deadly mudslides. Now this extinct volcano in Eastern Uganda offers a case study of not just the threat that climate change poses to people in the world's poorest communities – but also a novel potential solution. Uganda's government has taken a number of steps to move people out of harm's way, with limited success. Now the American non-profitGiveDirectly, an aid group known for its research-driven approach, is testing whether a more effective solution is to just give people a sizable cash grant with no strings attached. Their approach, implemented with the endorsement of Uganda's government, is aimed at a seeming contradiction: Many Mount Elgon residents haven't jumped at government offers to re-settle them. Yet, in a recent survey, GiveDirectly found that people are, in fact, desperate to leave. Wasika Mubarak says he and his family barely escaped a 2018 mudslide on Mount Elgon that injured one of his sons, then age 5 and destroyed his home. He says the only place they could afford to move to afterward was just as dangerous.Give Directlyhide caption Take Wasika Mubarak, a young father who was standing just outside his house during a devastating mudslide in 2018. ""I saw a great wave of water rushing down the mountain,"" he recalls, in the local language Lumasaba. ""It was picking up giant boulders. Swallowing houses."" Mubarak says he ran screaming to his wife, who was in the kitchen cooking with both their sons, then age 6 and 5. She grabbed the oldest and raced outside. Before she or Mubarak could go back for the youngest, the water surged past them, blocking the way ""It took us two hours to reach my son,"" says Mubarak. ""He had been hit with a rock and was bleeding from the head."" The boy recovered. But for Mubarak, what happened in the years that followed has felt almost as scary. With their home destroyed, the only new place they could afford to move to seemed just as dangerous. ""It's also right on the mountain,"" says Mubarak. ""And there are cracks in the ground around it. So we've been living in fear that at any time another landslide could kill us."" To understand why previous efforts to help people like Mubarak have not solved the problem, GiveDirectly's global research director Miriam Laker-Oketta gives the example of a government plan developed after a mudslide in 2010 that killed more than 300 people. Officials bought agricultural land in an alternative location for people to move to. ""It looks like a really great idea,"" says Laker-Oketta. "" 'Let's move these people to this place that is not yet overpopulated. Give them larger pieces of land than they have currently.' "" But she says before long, many people seemed to have returned to Mount Elgon. ""The fact is that people did not want to move to those places."" Officials have been slow to build promised new housing there. Droughts have cut into annual harvests. But also, the new plots were 230 miles east, in a part of the country with a different language, different traditions – where people lacked the connections that help them survive. Most significantly, says Laker-Oketta, it was a top-down solution – a problem that has undermined other attempts to help people in Mount Elgon and likely elsewhere too. ""As human beings we all want agency — the ability to make decisions based on what we believe is important for us,"" says Laker-Oketta. ""And I think that the big gap was [not] going to the people and trying to understand from them, 'What do you want to do?' "" One way to do that, she says, is to just give them cash grants that they can use however they see fit. Indeed, this is the insight that prompted GiveDirectly's founders to start the charity. For more than a decade they've been giving out no strings cash grants across the globe to help lift people out of extreme poverty. And so, says Laker-Oketta, it seemed a natural next step to see if the approach can also help people protect themselves from climate change – specifically by trying it out with the residents of Mount Elgon. First the nonprofit surveyed them to ask, ""How much money would you need to relocate to a new set-up of your choice?"" ""We got an approximate figure of $1,800,"" says Laker-Oketta. Then GiveDirectly started handing out no-strings grants in exactly that amount to about 4,000 households on the mountain. The results should be available by early next year. Charles Kenny, a senior analyst with the think tank Center for Global Development, who is not involved with GiveDirectly's efforts, says the project could have implications for poor people all over the world who live in the path of predictable climate disasters. This includes those residing in other mudslide zones – for instance in Rwanda and Bangladesh. But it could also help people residing on riverbanks prone to deadly flooding in Mozambique and Nigeria, or on farmland across sub-saharan Africa that's being rendered all but unusable by drought, or on islands ravaged by cyclones. Right now, argues Kenny, too much of climate aid is being spent on projects aimed at preventingfurtherclimate change, such as helping countries shift to renewable energy in order to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions. ""But the thing about climate change is it's having an impact now,"" says Kenny. ""And where it's having an impact is in the world's poorest countries. These people need help today to deal with the impact of climate change today."" Kenny says many priorstudieshave already shown that poor people tend to use no-strings cash aid effectively. ""And I think it makes particular sense when it comes to the climate crisis,"" he says. ""Giving people cash allows them to respond in the ways that they know best."" Early anecdotal evidence from the Mount Elgon study points at the ways people's individual priorities may vary. Mubarak, for instance, says he immediately used the money to buy land in a nearby district — ""out of the dangerous area,"" he says. He also bought metal sheets and poles and nails to build a house. He's still working on it, but he's already been able to move in. ""I'm finally going to save my family,"" he says. Jane Florence Kalenda, a mother of four, recently received $1,800 in no-strings cash from Give Directly. It's part of its study to see if the grants allow residents to find new, safer homes, off the risky slopes of Mount Elgon.Give Directlyhide caption Then there's Jane Florence Kalenda, a 56-year-old widowed mother of four. She says she, too, has used her grant to buy land off of the mountain and some construction materials. But she also decided to spend part of it on school fees for her children, even though that's left her short of the money needed to complete a new house. ""I estimate I still need about $530,"" she says. She's hoping to raise the money in a few more months by growing some onions from seeds that she also bought with the GiveDirectly grant. Laker-Oketta of GiveDirectly says while the nonprofit is obviously hoping this effort will get people off Mount Elgon right away, if people opt for paths like Kalenda's that slow the move, it's important to respect their choices. ""We need to know that people are going to make decisions based on what's important for them."" After all, she says, ""we're dealing with human beings. Not lab rats.""","['uganda', 'uganda', 'uganda', 'not found', 'rwanda', 'bangladesh', 'mozambique', 'nigeria']",us,False,False

Of the hundred buildings that once made up the town, there's almost nothing left.Coal brought fortune to Norway's Svalbard archipelago, but that bonanza became a curse for the remote group of islands, now the most harmful fossil energy for the climate.Svalbard, today home to 3,000 people and located in the fastest-warming region on the planet, is bit by bit erasing all traces of its mining past.A 40-minute helicopter flight from the main town of Longyearbyen, the Svea mine and its surrounding settlement have been returned to Mother Nature after a massive, recently-completed restoration project.""At its peak there were barracks for 300 people, with a canteen, an airfield with 35,000 passengers yearly, a power plant, a workshop, and storage,"" said Morten Hagen Johansen, in charge of the project at the mine where he was once employed.The Svea site is the biggest natural restoration ever undertaken in Norway.Only a handful of man-made objects remain, preserved because they are considered historic.They include a few dilapidated brick buildings, a rusted track vehicle, and railway tracks that once transported wagons loaded with coal.Rusty bits of rail track and other rubble are virtually all that remain on the site of the former Svea coal mine which operated from 1917 until 2020.The area ""was home to many miners who were working here for decades,"" Hanna Geiran, head of the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage, told AFP.""Preserving these artifacts helps to better understand what this place was,"" she added.AvalanchesThe mine was opened by a Swedish company in 1917 and officially closed 100 years later after producing 34 million metric tons of coal.The site has since been returned to its natural state at a cost of around 1.6 billion kroner (about $140 million) to the Norwegian state.""The concept is to try to let nature take it back,"" said Hagen Johansen.""That means to let creeks run freely. To make sure that avalanches do happen, because that will transport more sediment down and it will make new creeks.""The part of the Barents Sea where the Svalbard archipelago is located is warming up to seven times faster than the rest of the planet, according to a study published in last year.Former miner Morten Hagen Johansen (L) holds a picture of the mine.At Svea, a spectacular landslide recently created a deep crevasse down a hilly slope.""It is the result of a very heavy rainfall last summer where they got maybe 50-60 millimeters (2-2.3 inches) of rain in just 24 hours,"" geologist Fredrik Juell Theisen said.""That was very unusual beforeclimate changestarted changing the climate up here,"" he added.Russian presenceThe climate backlash is for the archipelago now trying to rid itself of fossil fuels.Seven other mines located in the hills of Longyearbyen have almost all been closed, with the last one due to shut in 2025.The town also disconnected its coal plant for good this month in exchange for a less-polluting diesel plant, ahead of a transition to renewable energies at a later stage.Going forward, Svalbard's economy will rely on tourism and scientific research.The area is warming up to seven times faster than the rest of the planet, according to a study published in Nature last year.The only coal still being mined on the archipelago will be a vein in Barentsburg, a Russian mining community with just under 500 Russians and Ukrainians, most of them from the Donbas region.Under the 1920international treatythat recognizes Norway's sovereignty over Svalbard, all signatories are entitled to exploit the region's natural resources equally.As a result, Russia has for decades maintained a mining community om Svalbard, via the state-run company Trust Arktikugol, in a strategic region belonging to a NATO member.According to some observers and Russia itself, strict environmental regulations that Norway has introduced in the region—about two-thirds of Svalbard land is protected in one way or another—are at least partly aimed at limiting .It's impossible to know whether such considerations played into Oslo's decision to restore the Svea mine at great cost, said Mats Kirkebirkeland of Norwegian think tank Civita.""But there's no denying that some of the Norwegian environmental policies and the geostrategic policies on Svalbard are aligned.""","['norway', 'norway', 'norway', 'norway', 'norway', 'norway', 'czechia', 'russia', 'russia']",gb,False,False

Gutu was confirmed dead with her Nepalese guide on Sunday byChinese state news agency Xinhua, which cited the region's sports bureau. Rzucdilo was declared dead alongside her Nepalese guide by Chinese authorities on Monday, prompting China to close Mount Shishapangma for the season due to unsafe snow conditions, her sistersaid in a statement on Facebook. ""Requests for search by helicopter from Nepal have been declined by the Chinese government,"" Christy Rzucidlo wrote, adding: ""We have been told the search for their bodies may resume in the spring once weather conditions are favorable."" Rzucdilo was only 264 meters, about 866 feet, away from the summit when the avalanche struck, according to Xinhua. Her mothertold The New York Timesthat her daughter had climbed over five peaks above 8,000 meters this year, and eight others in previous years. ""What I heard was that she was the strongest and happiest ever on that mountain,"" Suzan Rzucdilo said, per the newspaper. Gutu wrote about her adventures on Instagram, including mountain climbing, skydiving, and paragliding. In early August, sheposted a photo of herselfat the top of the world's second-highest mountain, K2, lodged between China and Pakistan. In the post, she said the mountain was known to have a ""curse"" for female climbers. ""I am happy to see that in recent years this curse has been broken by many female climbers,"" she said.

Within this rainy period are sudden and extremely intense cloudbursts, which often ""pop"" over a relatively small area (akin to a cloud bursting open like a balloon).As climate change is making these cloudbursts and other forms of heavy rainfallmore intense and more frequentin the Himalayan foothills, the hilly slopes are becoming saturated more frequently, and thus unstable. Rainfall-triggered landslides are already happening extensively across the Himalayas, and things are likely to get worse.From July to August 2023, the Indian Himalayas, particularly the state of Himachal Pradesh in the northern part of the country, experienced an unprecedented number of cloudbursts which triggered thousands ofdevastating landslides. The state's disaster management authority reported that by the end of August, heavyrainand rainfall-triggered landslides had caused509 fatalities, destroyed at least 2,200 homes anddamaged a further 10,000.It is estimated that Himachal Pradesh's losses from this period amount to US$1.2 billion. Much of the destruction took place during two short periods, one inmid-Julyand one inmid-August.The level of damage to buildings, roads and bridges is extremely difficult to comprehend. Several sections of national and state roads have been washed away, a temple in Shimla collapsed andkilled 20 people, rural dwellings largely constructed on sloped ground were washed away by rain, and houses are still sliding downhill.Schools and hospitals have been damaged, posing an ongoing threat to lives. A school in Kullu district was closed for 52 days because the bridge which connected it to a town had been washed away. Local people have had no option but to live in tents with minimal facilities. They are hugely concerned about their safety ahead of a cold and snowy winter.Four days of heavy rainfall in July 2023 triggered landslides thatblocked around 1,300 roadsincluding five national highways, leaving the state almost cut off from the rest of India. This had huge knock-on effects as1,255 bus routes were suspended, 576 buses were stranded, more than70,000 tourists had to be evacuated, and people could not access key facilities and services. This impeded emergency responders, causing critical delays in search and rescue operations as well as delivery of aid.Across the whole of India, the summer monsoon and its related cloudbursts aredecreasing. But in the Himalayan foothills, they areincreasing significantly—partly because when warm moist air encounters the Himalayan barrier it rapidly lifts and cools, forming large clouds that then dump their rain. With intense rain happening more and more often in the Himalayan foothills, it is likely that 2023's summer of disasters will occur again.Unnecessarily vulnerableAlthoughclimate changemay be to blame for the rise in cloudbursts, in an ideal world rainfall alone needn't lead to disastrous landslides. But the Himalayas have been mademore vulnerableby human actions.The region has largely beendeforested, removingtree rootswhich reinforce the ground and form a crucial barrier that stops soils washing away. And unplanned developments and haphazard construction have destabilized already fragile slopes.Initial reports on this year's landslides suggest the worst damages occurred along artificially cut slopes (for roads or buildings), where there has been a lack of proper provisioning for drainage and slope safety. In both India and Nepal, many of the hill roads have beenhaphazardly constructed, which makes landslides during rainfallmore likely. Construction guidelines andbuilding codesareoutdatedand have been ignored anyway, and there is little assessment of the link between urbanization andlandsliderisk.One obvious solution is to prevent rain from penetrating the ground, so the slopes avoid losing any strength. However, if the soil is entirely prevented from absorbing any rain, the water will instead run off the surface and cause greater flooding problems further downhill.One engineering solution is to place an artificial soil layer above the natural soil to temporarily hold water in the surface when it is raining extremely hard, preventing it penetrating deeper within the slope. This ""climate adaptive barrier layer"" will then release water back to the atmosphere during a later drying period.As the heavy rain intensifies, it will be hugely important for the Himalayas to implement new user-friendly and reliable construction guidelines that factor in how the climate is changing. Landslides can't be avoided entirely, and India certainly won't be able to reverse global warming and the increase in cloudbursts any time soon. But these preventive actions should at least make communities more resilient to the changing climate.","['india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'nepal']",gb,False,False

Thousands of people remain stranded in relief camps as bad weather delays airlift rescues. Along with destroying major infrastructure, the floods also damaged more than 1,200 houses, according to officials. More than 50 climbers were climbing up the summit of Shishapangma in Tibet when an avalanche crashed into them, killing an American mountaineer and her Nepali guide, China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency reported on Sunday. Two avalanches hit the slopes of Shishapangma, the world’s 14th tallest peak, at elevations of 7,600 metres and 8,000 metres on Saturday, killing the American climber Anna Gutu and her Nepali guide Mingmar Sherpa. Another American climber, Gina Marie Rzucidlo, and her Nepali guide, Tenjen Sherpa, were missing, Xinhua said. Climbers from around the world were pushing up the summit in what is a popular month for mountaineering in the Himalayas with eased monsoon rains making the conditions more stable. California was just about to become the first US state to explicitly outlaw caste-based discrimination – until Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed the bill late on Saturday. Last month, California’s senatepassed a billthat added caste as a form of protected ancestry under state civil rights law, as well as education and housing codes. Newsom called the bill “unnecessary” since the state already prohibits discrimination based on various characteristics such as colour, ancestry and national origin. “Because discrimination based on caste is already prohibited under these existing categories, this bill is unnecessary,” he said in a statement. 1/ Today, California Governor@GavinNewsomvetoed anti-caste discrimination bill#SB403. Though Newsom has rejected the legislation for now, our#casteequitymovement still views this as a win.https://t.co/jlcLn8ZRFOpic.twitter.com/TAKD3D1MZH — Equality Labs (@EqualityLabs)October 8, 2023 The debate around the bill has divided the Indian American community, with rights and social justice groups backing it as the most significant victory in combatting casteism in America. Proponents of the bill launched a hunger strike in early September pushing for the law’s passage. A United Nations report in 2016 said at least 250 million people worldwide still face caste discrimination in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Pacific regions, as well as in various diaspora communities. Caste systems are found among Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Muslims and Sikhs in South Asia. Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Equality Labs, the Oakland-based Dalit rights group that has been leading the movement to end caste discrimination in the US, said she still viewed the moment as a victory for caste-oppressed people who have “organised and built amazing power and awareness on this issue”. Sultan al-Jaber, the president-designate of COP28 to be held in the United Arab Emirates later this year, on Sunday said adaptation must be “front and centre” of theclimate agenda. “We live in a region of extreme heat, water scarcity and food insecurity. We are also suffering harsh climate impacts, from droughts to the devastating floods of Derna,” Jaber said, speaking at the MENA Climate Week in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh. “To deliver for our region we must put adaptation front and centre of the climate agenda.” Jaber also called on governments to abandon “fantasies” of hastily sideling existing energy infrastructure in pursuit of climate goals. “We cannot unplug the energy system of today before we build the new system of tomorrow. It is simply not practical or possible,” he said. COP28is scheduled to take place in the UAE between November 30 and December 12.

At least 10 people have been killed in India’s state of Sikkim and 82 others, including23 army personnel, are missing after heavy rainfall caused the glacial Lhonak Lake to overflow, spurring catastrophic flooding in the region. The northeastern state received 40.9mm (1.6 inches) of rainfall between Tuesday and Wednesday morning, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) – about five times its normal rate of 8.6mm (0.3 inches) for this time of the year. “So far, 10 bodies have been recovered from different locations. At least 82 more are missing and 22 people are injured, some of them seriously,” Sikkim’s Chief Secretary V B Pathak told Reuters news agency. A cloudburst – or an extreme amount of rain over a brief period of time – over Lhonak Lake triggered torrential flooding in the valley located about 150km (93 miles) north of Gangtok near the border with China. “Intense rain has led to this catastrophic situation in Sikkim where the rain has triggered a glacial lake outburst flood and damaged a dam and caused loss of life and caused further damage to roads and infrastructure,” said Miriam Jackson, a senior cryosphere specialist at the Nepal-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. The lake, which sits at the base of a glacier in peaks surrounding the world’s third-highest mountain, Kangchenjunga, had shrunk by nearly two-thirds in size overnight, an area roughly equivalent to 150 football pitches (105 hectares), satellite photographs released by the Indian Space Research Organisation showed. Heavy rainfall hampered the search for the Indian troops reported missing, with the capital city of Gangtok cut off by road, defence officials said. “Twenty-three personnel have been reported missing and some vehicles are reported submerged under the slush. Search operations are under way,” a defence ministry spokesperson said. India’s weather department has warned of landslides and disruption to flights as heavy rain is predicted to continue over the next two days in some parts of Sikkim. Jackson warned that such extreme events have become more frequent “as the climate continues to warm and takes us into unknown territory”. The main highway linking Sikkim to West Bengal state had collapsed and Gangtok was totally cut off by road, according to army spokesperson Anjan Basumatary. About 15,000 people living in the vicinity are likely to be affected and at least eight major bridges have been washed away along the banks of the Teesta River, officials said.

Intermittent rain and thunderstorms were hampering rescue operations in the area, an army official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office said in a statement that the government will support state authorities in meeting the challenges from the floods. Violent flooding from glacier lakes dammed by loose rock has become more frequent as global temperatures rise and ice melts, with scientists on Wednesday warning the deadly flood was a taste of further extreme weather events to come.

In Coimbatore district, Mettuapalayam witnessed the season's most intense rainfall, measuring a staggering 37 cm within 24 hours. The deluge prompted the Nilgiris district collector to declare a shutdown of all government and private schools in Coonoor and Kotagiri today, citing the unrelenting precipitation. Torrential rains wreaked havoc on various parts of Coimbatore, causing extensive waterlogging and resulting in extensive traffic snarls in the textile hub. Notably, near the Ramanathapuram signal, roads were submerged under pools of rainwater, severely impacting commuting. Quick intervention by Ramanathapuram Traffic Division Special Assistant Inspectors Anbazagan and Murugaswamy proved instrumental in clearing the waterlogged roads after dedicated efforts. In Thoothukodi, heavy rains led to a tree falling on a truck, disrupting traffic for nearly two hours. The Kalgukumalai fire department and local police collaborated to swiftly remove the tree, alleviating the traffic standstill on the Mettupalayam and Coonoor route. Landslides in the area compelled authorities to redirect public traffic to the Mettupalayam-Kotagiri route. The inclement weather also prompted the Indian Railways to suspend services along the Nilgiri Mountain Rail Route between Coonoor and Mettupalayam due to landslides triggered by heavy rainfall. Mudslides obstructed tracks at Hillguro, necessitating the suspension for safety reasons. The forecast indicates a continued spell of light to moderate rains across Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal. The Indian Meteorological Department warns of thunderstorms and lightning in certain Tamil Nadu regions, while isolated heavy rainfall is expected in specific districts, including Tiruvallur, Ranipet, and Kancheepuram. The regional weather forecast department of Tamil Nadu alerts to anticipated rains in districts like Thrivallur, Chennai, Chengalpattu, Kanchipuram, Viluppuram, Cuddalore, Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, Tirunelveli, and Thotukudi. Moreover, IMD forecasts heavy rainfall in select districts for the upcoming days, emphasizing preparedness in Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram, Villupuram, Cuddalore, Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur , Thanjavur , and Pudukkottai districts of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal area on Saturday. The relentless downpours have led to widespread disruptions, forcing closures of schools in multiple districts, including Coonoor and Kotagiri. The situation remains precarious with traffic congestions, waterlogging, and incidents of vehicles getting stranded, compelling collaborative efforts by authorities and local departments to manage the chaos caused by the heavy rains in the region.
