The attack follows a surge in anti-Semitic incidents across Europe. Oskar Deutsch, a leader of Vienna’s Jewish community, reported the vandalism and arson in a social media post on Wednesday, saying areas of the city’s central cemetery were severely damaged. “During the night a fire was set on the Jewish part of the central cemetery,”he wrote.“The anteroom of the ceremonial hall [was] burned out. Swastikas were sprayed on exterior walls. No people were injured. The fire department and police are investigating.” In der Nacht wurde am jüdischen Teil des Zentralfriedhofs (IV. Tor) ein Brand gelegt. Der Vorraum der Zeremonienhalle ist ausgebrannt. An Außenmauern wurden Hakenkreuze gesprayt. Personen kamen nicht zu Schaden. Feuerwehr und Polizei ermitteln.pic.twitter.com/LLvCrrXIge Deutsch shared photos of the aftermath, showing firefighters inspecting a heavily charred and smoke-filled ceremony hall. What appear to be crude swastikas were also seen scrawled in fluorescent paint on a wall outside. A spokesperson for the local fire service, Gerald Schimpf, told the Austria Press Agency that the fire seemed to have broken out sometime on Tuesday night, but had mostly died out on its own by the time firefighters arrived the next morning. The Vienna State Police later confirmed that the episode was being“intensively investigated”by Austria’s Office for the Protection of the Constitution. While the authorities have stated that that the exact circumstances of the fire“are not yet known,”local media reports said police suspected arson, noting that flames appeared to have ignited in more than one location. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer also“strongly”condemned the incident in a statement, declaring that“anti-Semitism has no place in our society and will be fought with all political and legal means.”He went on to voice hopes that perpetrators of the cemetery attack would be“identified quickly.” The incident in Vienna follows a string of similar reports across Europe in recent weeks, amid renewed fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. Fears of violent reprisals against Jews have prompted evacuations and closures at a number of religious institutions, with several Jewish schools in Paris reportedly forced to clear out following bomb threats earlier this week. Jewish organizations have also warned of a rise in anti-Semitism in the US, where the Anti-Defamation League has reported a nearly 400% spike in such incidents this month."

Read more:U.N. Climate Warning Also Comes With Clear Steps To Cut Emissions The miseries of long, drawn-out disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report — more than half of them in Somalia — but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no pre-emptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide,climate changehas already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines; storms are battering megacities and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. “The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in (the) future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify,” said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the report's authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 2016-21 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. Floods displaced children more than 19 million times in places like India and China. Wildfires impacted children 810,000 times in the U.S. and Canada. Data tracking migrations because of weather extremes typically don't differentiate between children and adults. UNICEF worked with a Geneva-based nonprofit, the International Displacement Monitoring Center, to map where kids were most impacted. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. Those countries also have vast populations and strong systems to evacuate people, which makes it easier for them to record data. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring “overlapping crises” — where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. During unprecedented flooding of the Yamuna River in July in the Indian capital New Delhi, churning waters washed away the hut that was home to 10-year-old Garima Kumar’s family. The waters also took her school uniform and her school books. Kumar lived with her family on sidewalks of the megacity and missed a month of school. “Other students in the school teased me because my house had been flooded. Because we don’t have a permanent home,” Kumar said. The floodwaters have receded and the family began repairing their home last month — a process Garima’s mother Meera Devi said they are having to do over and over again as floods are becoming more common. Her father, Shiv Kumar, hasn’t had any work for over a month. The family's only income is the mother’s $2 daily earnings as a domestic helper. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnam-based expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasn’t involved with the report. “When you’re desperate, you do things that you normally wouldn’t do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they don’t have the ability to stand up for themselves,” she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become “shock-responsive, portable and inclusive,” to help children and their families better cope with disasters. This would mean considering children’s needs at different stages, from ensuring they have opportunities to study, that they can stay with their families and that eventually they can find work. “We have the tools. We have the knowledge. But we’re just not working fast enough,” Healy said."

That works out to 20,000 children displaced every single day due to extreme weather fueled by climate change. The researchers found that floods and storms caused 95% of all child displacements recorded, with the rest due to drought and wildfires. “It is terrifying for any child when a ferocious wildfire, storm or flood barrels into their community,” said UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell, in a statement. Thereportis the first of its kind, according to UNICEF. “Until now, children displaced by weather-related events have been statistically invisible,” the organization said in a statement. East Asia and the Pacific have been particularly affected. In 2020,Cyclone Amphanled to 1.5 million child displacements across India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Bhutan. In 2021,Typhoon Raicaused 1.5 million child displacements across the Philippines, Palau and Vietnam. By overall numbers of displacements, three countries dominated: the Philippines, India and China, where a total of 23 million children were forced from their homes and schools across the six-year period. The location and geography of these countries make them prone to floods and storms, which are set to worsen as the climate crisis intensifies. However, the report noted that all three countries implement preemptive evacuation plans, meaning children can be moved before a disaster hits, which may account for the higher numbers of displacements. A different picture emerges when looking at the number of children displaced relative to the size of each country’s population. Storms in the small Caribbean island country of Dominica, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017, displaced 76% of the child population over the six-year period. South Sudan and Somalia experienced the highest proportion of child displacement from flooding, with 11% and 12% of children having to flee their homes, the report found. Both countries implement far fewer evacuation plans, making children even more vulnerable, according to the report. Meanwhile drought, particularly in Somalia, Ethiopia and Afghanistan has contributed to over 1.3 million children having to leave their homes. However these statistics are likely to be conservative, as there is less data available for slow-onset disasters like drought, the reported noted. Wildfires in the US and Canada have also led to child displacement, and they are likely to cause larger-scale displacements in the future, the report found. “For those who are forced to flee, the fear and impact can be especially devastating, with worry of whether they will return home, resume school, or be forced to move again. Moving may have saved their lives, but it’s also very disruptive,” UNICEF’s Russell said. Whether short-lived or long-term, displacement can amplify risks of exploitation, child trafficking and abuse, while also exposing children to malnutrition, disease and inadequate immunization, the report found. The situation is poised to get worse. As the human-caused climate crisis accelerates, extreme weather is becoming more severe and more common. With every additional 1 degree Celsius of warming, the global risks of displacement from flooding are projected to rise by 50%, according to research cited in the report. “We have the tools and knowledge to respond to this escalating challenge for children, but we are acting far too slowly,” Russell said."

By Subel Rai Bhandari for RFA 2023.10.06 -- More than 43 million children were internally displaced over six years due to climate change-exacerbated, weather-related disasters, with China, India and the Philippines leading the chart in absolute numbers, a U.N. agency said in a new report. ""While the link between climate change and displacement is complex, it's clearer than ever that the climate is shifting patterns of displacement,"" UNICEF said Friday in a statement, releasing the report, ""Children displaced in a changing climate."" Between 2016 and 2021, the U.N. Children's Fund said 43.1 million youngsters - or about 20,000 child displacements a day - across 44 countries were displaced in the most common weather-related hazards, including floods, storms, droughts and wildfires. Floods and storms drove 95% of recorded child displacements. It was unclear how many of the 43 million children were, in fact, preemptive evacuees, as opposed to displaced for the short or long term. ""It is terrifying for any child when a ferocious wildfire, storm or flood barrels into their community,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. ""For those who are forced to flee, the fear and impact can be especially devastating, with worry of whether they will return home, resume school, or be forced to move again. Moving may have saved their lives, but it's also very disruptive."" ""As the impacts of climate change escalate, so too will climate-driven movement."" The report said 9.7 million child displacements in the Philippines alone, 6.7 million in India, and 6.4 million in China were due to all four hazards combined. The numbers were high due to geographic locations, exposure to extreme weather, large child populations, and progress made on early warning and evacuation capacities. Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Vietnam came fourth, eighth, and ninth in the top-10 ranking based on absolute numbers, with 3.3 million, 960,000, and 930,000 children respectively displaced between 2016 and 2021. Relative to the size of their child population, Dominica (76%) experienced the largest number of child displacements from all four disasters. The list included Vanuatu, the Philippines, and Fiji. Between 2016 and 2021, floods displaced roughly 19.7 million children globally. India (3.9 million), China (3.7 million), and the Philippines (1.3 million) were hardest hit. Similarly, storms led to the displacement of about 21 million children, with the highest numbers in the Philippines (8.3 million), India (2.8 million) and China (2.6 million). Asia and the Pacific frequently experience storms, leading to mass evacuations. In 2020, Cyclone Amphan displaced 1.5 million children in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Bhutan, while Typhoon Rai (Odette) displaced 1.5 million children in the Philippines, Palau, and Vietnam in 2021. Droughts caused over 1.3 million child displacements in 15 countries, with 730,000 in Somalia, 340,000 in Ethiopia, and 190,000 in Afghanistan. Wildfires, which primarily affected the Americas, displaced 810,000 children between 2016 and 2021, with the United States, Canada, and Israel seeing the highest child displacements at 610,000, 47,000, and 31,000, respectively. Using a disaster displacement risk model, the UNICEF report predicted that riverine floods may displace an average of 3.2 million children annually, totaling 96 million over 30 years. Cyclonic winds follow, potentially displacing over 10.3 million children, while storm surges might account for 7.2 million displacements in the same three-decade span. ""Given their large population, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Philippines and China are the five countries with the most predicted future displacements of children owing to all hazards combined (riverine flood, cyclones and storm surges),"" the report said.

Dozens of flights were canceled, diverted or delayed at Luton, located about 56 kilometers (35 miles) north of central London, after the blaze erupted late Tuesday. Four firefighters and an airport employee were treated for the effects of smoke inhalation after the fire. Officials at the airport, which is a hub for easyJet, Ryanair and other budgetairlinesrunning flights to destinations in theUnited Kingdomand Europe, said flights began to arrive and take off again Wednesday afternoon. Investigators believe the fire started with a diesel vehicle, according to Chief Fire Officer Andrew Hopkinson of the Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service. The recently opened parking garage didn't appear to have sprinklers, he said. “And then that fire has quickly and rapidly spread,"" Hopkinson told reporters. More than 100 firefighters were deployed to tackle the blaze, he said. Authorities said they don’t believe someone started the fire intentionally. Some passengers had to sleep on the floor in the airport or wait at the nearby railway station after their flights were canceled or delayed. Nikodem Lesiak, a university student trying to return to Poland, said he spent the night at the station. “When we got here, we found out Luton is burning and everything is closed, and we were supposed to have our flight at 7:50 today but it was canceled,"" he said. Video posted on social media and on the websites of British news outlets Tuesday showed police and fire department vehicles gathered outside the multistory parking structure where the top level was engulfed in flames. Russell Taylor, 41, an account director from Kinross, Scotland, saw the flames after flying in to Luton from Edinburgh. He said that he first saw a couple of fire engines with a car on fire on an upper level of the garage, which served Terminal 2. ""A few minutes later, most of the upper floor was alight, car alarms were going off with loud explosions from cars going up in flames,"" he said.

American cities are const… [+12570 chars]",Real estate,"American cities are constantly in competition — for people, professional sports teams, headline-grabbing events, and company headquarters. For decades, cities have duked it out for titles like ""best city for business"" or ""healthiest city in America,"" but now they're starting to compete for a new title: best place to ride out dystopia. Every American city has its charms and its flaws. Some boast of great barbecue, while others tout their proximity to sandy beaches. The country's vast size gives American families and businesses a large menu of climates, real-estate markets, andamenities from which to choose. It also forces elected officials to employ a variety of tactics such ascash incentives, infrastructure investments, and tax breaks to win over prospective transplants and fortify their economies. Whether it's Los Angeles scoring the 2028 Olympics, or Austin persuading Tesla to move its headquarters to the city, splashy announcements generate buzz about the winning cities and allow them to sell people on the upside of moving to the area. On the flip side, cities that lose people and jobs are at risk of entering the ""urban doom loop"" — a downward spiral ofdeclining economic vitality, falling tax revenue, and a drop in local public services. Over the past 50 years, the winners of this intercity battle have been the booming metros in theSun Belt. Millions of people have migrated to the US South and West seeking out the sun and cheaper homes. Business has followed: Theheadquarters of Fortune 500 companieshave rapidly shifted away from industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast toward cities like Dallas, Houston, and Atlanta. However, in recent years these onetime winners have started to grapple with a new set of challenges caused by the changing climate:120-degree days in the summer, encroaching flood waters, and the ever present threat of wildfires. The idyllic destinations for Americans seeking a better life are starting to look like precarious long-term bets. While Sun Belt cities are working to mitigate these challenges, the increased risks also create an opportunity for once forgotten cities. Places that previously were in decline such as Buffalo, New York, and Detroit are rolling out a new type of marketing campaign to make the case that they can offer a desirable mix of stable weather, cheap housing, and robust public investment. These ""climate oases"" and ""climate havens"" have been trying to attract newly footloose Americans, freed from the office by the rise of working from home, and lure risk-averse people who are deeply concerned about rising climate risk. While many Americans are still moving into areas facing arising tide of disasters, the country's increasing climate risks have sparked a countermovement of people looking for a safe haven from storms and droughts. A report from the real-estate-data provider CoreLogic found that14.5 million homes in the USwere affected by natural disasters in 2021, and according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the number of disasters causing more than $1 billion in damage has been increasing over the past 10 years. The frequency of these costly catastrophes is making many Americans rethink their living arrangements: 23% of people surveyed ina recent USA Today pollsaid they thought they would eventually be forced to move because of the climate crisis. For Americans living in areas more prone to disasters, the numbers were even higher — 30% of people in the West said they anticipated needing to move eventually. Most of the current climate migration is happening in outlying areas faced with recurring natural disasters. Longtime residents of theFlorida Keys, which have been battered by fierce hurricanes and rising sea levels, are starting to leave their homes. And many residents of rural California are finding it increasingly difficult to purchasehome insurancein fire-prone areas, prompting some to move. But as weather extremes become more pronounced, major metro areas could start to feel some strain. A 2016 study published in the Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists,found that""Americans favor a daily average temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit"" and would generally pay more to avoid excessive heat rather than cold. So as average temperatures start to drift higher around the country, some of the more populated areas in theSouth and West could begin to lose outas people seekrelief from the heat. This opens the door for once beleaguered locales in the Midwest and industrial Northeast to reenter the ring. For decades, cities such as Detroit, Baltimore, and Cincinnati have been on a downward spiral as they lose people and businesses to the sunnier parts of the country. But now the tides are starting to turn in their favor: These cities generally have easy access to plenty of clean water, cooler climates, and less exposure to the coastal hurricanes, forest fires, and flooding that are more frequent in the Sun Belt. Add in relatively cheap homes and a willingness to invest in the types of infrastructure necessary to adapt to our changing planet, and the formerly forgotten parts of the country are starting to look attractive. Take Buffalo. The city's population has since 1970 been on a long, steady decline as its thriving industrial sector was hollowed out. Now, the city's leaders have sensed an opportunity to revitalize the region. Buffalo's natural characteristics provide a good starting point — its high temperature in July of 79 degrees is much cooler than in Phoenix, for instance. And according to data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the city has been hit by only 27 federally declared disasters since 1953. Compare that with the 80 disasters that have hit Los Angeles County and the 41 disasters in Miami-Dade County. Then there's its abundant freshwater from Lake Erie, relatively cheap housing market — Zillowshows that the median home pricein the city was $215,000 as of October — and robust infrastructure from the city's previous life as a manufacturing center. With all that in mind, Buffalo has a chance to stage a serious comeback. Buffalo's leaders have decided to capitalize on these advantages by explicitly painting the city as a safe spot to ride out the county's coming climate upheaval. In a 2019 speech, Mayor Byron Brown said the city would be a ""climate refuge"" for Americans seeking a more stable place to lay down roots and promised to make investments in the city's resiliency. The declaration has been followed up with investments in key areas — climate resilience was one of the four pillars that made up the city's four-year strategic plan released at the start of 2023. As part of the plan, Buffalo's government said it planned to invest in a more resilient localelectricity grid, convert city vehicles and buildings to renewable energy, and invest in emissions-reducing infrastructure such as electric-vehicle charging stations and improved bike lanes. Beyond direct investment, the city also committed to working with private businesses to reduce their climate impact, including financing that allows companies to make energy-efficient upgrades to their facilities on the cheap. While there are many questions about the rollout of the plans, the vocal commitment of Buffalo to make the changes needed to make the city more climate-resilient will likely act as a clarion call for many Americans. Each year, roughly 8 million Americans move to a different state. If 1% of these movers chose Buffalo, this would be an inflow of 80,000 people to a city home to 275,000 people — a massive increase. And Buffalo isn't the only city in the country's industrial belt trying to win over new residents with this sales pitch: Places includingDuluth, Minnesota;Grand Rapids, Michigan; and evenChicagoare also making a bid for free-moving and climate-concerned workers. Climate competition is still just one aspect of the battle between cities. Other factors, such as schools, crime, and job availability, are also crucial to developing the image as an up-and-coming place to move. Many of the cities that are trying to offer themselves to ""climate refugees"" have struggled with one or more of these elements in the recent past — but there is hope here. Households and individuals are able to make an informed decision about where to live based on a wealth of data, on things including home prices, graduation rates for public schools, and job openings. For concerns such as crime, theFBI has a tool on its websiteto allow people to compare data for different cities and states across the country. As we start to learn more about the emerging climate risks to various parts of the country, the US government can play a similar role in providing city-level data including recent temperature by month, air pollution, natural-disaster damage, and rainfall. The real-estate firmRedfinhas partnered with the nonprofit First Street Foundation to provide property-level report cards on fire, flood, and heat risk to people searching for housing. My ongoing research highlights that homebuyers in both red states and blue states have begun to make decisions based on this information, weighing it as a factor in where they choose to move. As extreme weather events occur, people looking for a new home will be able to evaluate how many people died or lost their homes in any given city because of the climate crisis. The most climate-resilient cities will become the clear winners. And if cities such as Buffalo and Detroit invested in infrastructure — from new roads and renewable-power plants to entertainment districts and improved schools — to support movers, this would act as a self-reinforcing economic cycle that could enhance their natural weather advantages. As the population grows, new restaurants and cultural opportunities will pop up. Home prices will grow, creating local wealth and economic development. And the spending on activities and housing will boost local tax revenues and provide cities a chance to reinvest in core services — the opposite of the ""doom loop."" But public-sector investment alone won't go very far without the innovation of the private sector. Northern and Midwestern states will need a strong private-sector presence to meet the ever evolving demands that the climate crisis and a wave of new residents will bring. Here, too, there are hopeful examples. In the recent past, the city of Pittsburgh suffered a sharp decline when its ""golden goose"" of steel production declined. In recent decades,the city has made a dramatic comebackas a ""brains economy"" featuring robotics firms working with researchers at nearby universities and the rise of the health-innovation economy. After decades of decline, census estimates show that the Pittsburgh area's population finally leveled off from 2010 to 2022 and suggest that the number of people living in the citycould bounce back in the coming years. Pittsburgh's rebound offers an optimistic case study for other Rust Belt cities. The shifting climate does not mean that there will be a sudden migration of Americans to the middle of the country. Many people still stick close to home: A 2015 report from The New York Times found that the averageAmerican lived only 18 miles from their mother. And the cities that could become climate havens have their weather downsides — Buffalo will still have some harsh winters, too. But even in small numbers, regional migration will have serious downstream effects on America's cities. If Buffalo, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and other cities succeed in their climate-resilience agendas, they will grow, attracting residents from more at-risk areas of the country. That, in turn, will force at-risk cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Phoenix to invest more to offset their heat and flood risk. Even on a city level, competition fosters innovation — and the great ""Super Bowl"" of climate competition will spur our collective adaptation. Matthew E.

On a crisp autumn morning, a Labrador with a shiny black coat zigzags over broken concrete and steel rebar. There are overturned boats, piles of wood, a broken-down bus. As he climbs the small mountain of rubble, his nose is down, tail straight. This dog is working — focused and searching for a person. The thing is, we're at a training ground in the back of a construction site outside Baltimore. The person he's looking for is fine, hiding with a walkie-talkie. And all that rubble was brought in for the purpose of teaching dogs to find people after a disaster, as part of a program by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Around the country, FEMA has 280 certified detection dogs trained to find people in disasters, and it has another 80 that look for human remains. They deploy everywhere from collapsed buildings to natural disasters. Earlier this year, 35 dogs were sent to Hawaii to recover bodies of people who died in the wildfires. At the training site outside Baltimore, Maryland Task Force One is putting its dogs through their paces. Victoria Ledwell is at the helm, working as both the canine coordinator and a dog handler for FEMA's Urban Search and Rescue squad. As a retired firefighter, she's used to responding to emergencies. Ledwell and her dog Pasquale were deployed to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Fiona and, later, to South Florida after Hurricane Ian.

""I love this part of it,"" Ledwell says as she gestures toward a dog doing drills. ""They love what they're doing and I love watching that. ... You'll see them come off the pile after they've done a search and they've been successful. Some of them will carry their toy with them, and they're so proud and they'll show it off to you."" As the one overseeing the training, Ledwell begins the day by huddling with about a dozen handlers. She congratulates one team for passing an exam, but when the group claps, the handler brushes it off, directing the praise to the work of his canine partner. ""I just stood there and looked pretty. That's my job,"" he says, laughing. Many of these dogs are already FEMA certified but are back at training and doing drills because the handler-canine pairs have to be recertified every three years. Later, as Ledwell is explaining the process, she's interrupted by enthusiastic barking — a dog has zeroed in on one of several ""bark barrels"" — big plastic tubes used in search and rescue training. They are dotted around the training site and feature a small opening, just big enough for a dog's snout. Only one of these bark barrels has a person inside, so the dogs are put to the test. Parker successfully finds someone in a bark barrel.Haiyun Jiang for NPRhide caption Parker successfully finds someone in a bark barrel. The training site is designed to test all aspects of the canine rescuers.Haiyun Jiang for NPRhide caption The training site is designed to test all aspects of the canine rescuers. This dog has just found its prize and the barking goes on for about 20 seconds. The handler lets the dog know the mission is accomplished, and the volunteer inside emerges with a small container of food ready to reward their canine rescuer, along with plenty of pats and praise. In this case the prize was food, but typically it's a specific toy that the dog chose itself. The dog only gets it as a reward during training and missions. When handlers and their dogs are deployed, each has to pack that special toy. ""My last dog had what we called 'the flying squirrel',"" Ledwell said. ""It was like a floppy Frisbee, and it didn't fit well into pockets. But it didn't matter that it was hard for me to carry, because for him that was important. I had to make it work."" A lot of the dogs on Maryland Task Force One are Labradors, but the teams are made up of a range of breeds including German shepherds, golden retrievers, springer spaniels and mixed breeds. Some of these dogs started out as strays or in a shelter — dogs like Pager. Pager is an excitable boy who likes to chew things and lick faces. He's a big Labrador from a kennel in Maine and was sent to a ""puppies behind bars"" program at just 8 weeks old, where he would've been trained for police or wounded veterans programs. But Pager was too rambunctious and high-energy. Pager plays with his handler, Joshua Kurland.Haiyun Jiang for NPRhide caption Pager plays with his handler, Joshua Kurland.

That's how he ended up alongside his handler, Joshua Kurland, a canine search specialist with this task force. Kurland has been a handler for more than a decade, and he also works for Montgomery County Fire & Rescue. The fire academy is where he first became interested in working with dogs. ""I probably should've been paying attention to my fire skills, but I saw canines working and I thought, 'Oh, the fire department has canines',"" he says with a laugh. ""Hopefully Pager does all right here,"" Kurland says as he and Pager walk out to an open field for a drill. There are wooden tables set up like a baseball diamond, each about 75 feet apart. In case of instability in a pile of rubble, dogs sometimes search while their humans stand on solid ground, so handlers like Kurland have to be able to control them from a safe distance. Kurland and Pager share a moment of fun.Haiyun Jiang for NPRhide caption Kurland and Pager share a moment of fun.

Kurland shouts as Pager barrels toward the wooden platform and jumps up, only to slide off due to the morning dew. ""Pager, back!"" After a few tries, Pager gets the hang of it — hopping up when told, then turning around and sitting, waiting for Kurland's approval. ""Pager, come!"" He dashes back. ""Good boy!"" Kurland rewards Pager with his special toy — a tug with a rope on the end — and they play fetch in the field as his reward. It wasn't a perfect run, but it would've passed, according to Kurland. The team puts on helmets and waits around a massive pile of concrete to send Pager in for another drill. Two people are hiding in the rubble — one volunteer has carefully lowered himself into a concrete tube that's surrounded by bricks and broken slabs for the rescue simulation. Throughout the rubble are ""distractors,"" such as bags of dirty laundry and food — anything to try to throw the dogs off the scent of finding someone. Kurland takes off Pager's leash and collar and he gets to work. He darts across the pile, nose down, homing in. Within minutes, he's barking, alerting Kurland that he found someone until Kurland carefully makes his way over and rewards him. Shaffner rewards Parker with some pets.Haiyun Jiang for NPRhide caption Shaffner rewards Parker with some pets. He struggles a bit to find the next person, going back and forth, passing the hiding spot a few times before eventually finding it. Once he begins barking, the volunteer in the tube rewards Pager with his toy and they get into an enthusiastic game of tug of war. A group of tough handlers in uniform, watching stoically, immediately melt when Pager makes his rescue. As he makes his way back off the pile, they collectively raise their voices an octave to congratulate Pager with pets and baby talk. To the team, that's potentially another life saved. But to Pager, he's just a very good boy doing his job."

Living with Wildfire– a report from the Insurance Institute of Business & Home Safety (IBHS), the National Fire Protection Association® (NFPA®) andVerisk, examined community vulnerability and wildfire readiness around the wildland-urban interface (WUI) in 13 Western states. Separating wildfire safety from traditional building codes and a lack of clear guidance on how to integrate them has resulted in limited use by state and local officials. ""Californiaand Utah are the only Western states with uniformly enforced statewide codes specifically addressing wildfire exposures to residential and commercial properties,"" said IBHS Managing Director for Standards & Data Analytics Dr.Ian Giammanco. ""A few local jurisdictions have proactive approaches, but they stand in sharp contrast to the majority of counties and local communities that largely fail to comprehensively address wildfire risks through building codes and up-to-date planning activities."" While 45 million structures are at risk nationwide, roughly 14 million U.S. structures are at risk from wildfire across the 13 Western states, according to Verisk's Wildfire Risk Analysis. Due to population growth, inadequate fuel management practices and the limited use and enforcement of WUI building codes, community wildfire risk is higher than ever and exacerbated by climate change. Despite a federal mandate requiring Community Wildfire Protection Plans in areas adjacent to national forests and rangelands, one in four high-risk counties studied lacked plans to adequately address the risk. Seventeen percent of the counties examined had not updated their plans in over 10 years. ""NFPA, IBHS and Verisk, among many organizations, have long recognized that implementing and enforcing statewide policies play a critical role in reducing wildfire's impact on people and property,"" saidMichele Steinberg, director of the NFPA wildfire division. ""This report confirms that the majority of states and jurisdictions at highest risk to wildfire aren't putting the needed requirements and measures in place to effectively mitigate wildfire risks. Sadly, as long as they don't, communities will continue to pay a high price in the wake of wildfires."" The study also shows there is no correlation between the amount counties spend on wildfire-related activities and the use of WUI codes or community wildfire preparedness plans in those counties. ""Verisk supports coordinated research and education to help reduce the scope and severity of wildfire losses,"" said Dr.Arindam Samanta, director of product management, Verisk Underwriting Solutions. ""This collaboration represents another step in Verisk's efforts to help insurance carriers manage wildfire risk and to build stronger, more resilient communities."" Wildfire disasters affect not only lives and property, but the safety and effectiveness of the fire service, the ability of businesses and local governments to recover and the insurance industry's ability to provide a financial safety net for people to rebuild their lives and livelihoods. The report notes local fire departments serve as a vital and trusted communications link for communities to understand how to reduce risk. However, support for inspection and outreach programs is highly variable across the West because local fire departments often lack both the needed training and financial resources.

If you're seeking to future-proof your career in a relatively stable sector, earn a decent salary and benefits with potential for growth, and serve your nation with honor in a role that exists to benefit humanity, a career within the government would make an excellent choice for you. While there are many positions within government agencies or services that necessitate a degree and some prior experience, the good news is that there are other roles that do not require these at all. Rather, many of them require specialized training, on-the-job-learning, physical fitness, and competencies such as strong problem-solving skills, excellent communication, leadership ability, and confident expert decision-making in high-pressure environments. Here are some potential roles you may want to consider if you are seeking to forge a rewarding career in government. (Please note that the roles and salaries listed are for the U.S. only. Specific job titles, salaries, and entry requirements may vary depending on your country. Specific requirements may also vary depending on your state or municipality. Salaries listed are taken from salary comparison sites Glassdoor, Zip Recruiter, and Salary.com.) Deputy Sheriff Deputy sheriffs enforce state and municipal laws and are responsible for overall community safety. They undertake duties such as patrolling, responding to emergencies, attending court to provide testimony, and investigating and deterring crimes. To be a deputy sheriff, you will need to meet minimum requirements which include being over 18, holding US citizenship, having good fitness aptitude and physical stamina, possessing a high school diploma/GED, and completing relevant training. Average salaries for this role tend to hover at $64,379 per annum. Court Reporter As a court reporter, your daily duties would include recording legal proceedings and creating accurate transcripts for court and government hearings, while acting as a liaison for attorneys and the court. Some of the required skills include accuracy and strict attention to detail, clear writing skills, understanding of legal and medical terminology, a firm grip on English grammar, and strong listening skills. You must also be able to operate a stenographic machine at 200 wpm, and depending on the state, possess a high school diploma or associates degree, or other form of post-secondary education. Court reporters earn $62,212 per annum on average. US Army Soldier Specific entry requirements vary depending on rank, however for an enlisted soldier, you will need to be at least 18 years of age, hold US citizenship and a high school diploma or equivalent, and have the strictest health and fitness standards, in addition to a stable financial history and a crime-free record. More information can be obtained from the US Army's recruiting website. Enlisted soldiers have potential for career progression as they study, train, and continue to work up the ranks in leadership. Average salary per annum is $77,659. Census Taker Census takers collect economic and demographic data on behalf of the U.S. Census Bureau. This data feeds into reports such as those produced by the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, which demonstrates key information related to economics and job outcomes that are important for confident analysis, decision-making and policy-creation. To be a census taker you will need to pass a background check and have a clean record, have U.S. citizenship, be available for the times required, and undergo training for the role. You will also need to possess skills such as excellent communication and interpersonal skills to conduct interviews, and have good time management while being a self-starter. Census takers earn an average of $37,071. Admin Assistant Administrative assistants perform clerical duties to ensure the smooth operation of office-related tasks, including filing documents and important information, data entry and retrieving data, being the face of the office for guests and enquiries, and organizing and scheduling appointments and meetings. This requires you to have extensive organizational and multitasking skills, clear communication, and have a knack for building rapport and relationships. You will also need technical proficiency in admin-related software and at the very least hold a high school diploma or equivalent. You can expect to earn $43, 415 on average in this role. Lifeguard Lifeguards protect the public in settings such as beaches, resorts, and leisure parks where there are bodies of water. They actively scan and guard the pool at all times it is in use, and respond to emergencies or accidents, while identifying risks and maintaining its usability. To be a lifeguard, you'll need to hold a first-aid qualification and emergency response certifications, participate in a lifeguard training program, be able to swim at specified levels, and have physical stamina. Average salary per annum is $26,993. Firefighter Similarly to lifeguards, this uniformed role protects the public safety through extinguishing and controlling fires, responding to safety incidents and emergencies, and inspecting scenes where a fire has occurred to unearth relevant findings. To be a firefighter you will need training such as EMT, First Aid, CPR, and firefighter training, in addition to passing background checks, holding a high school diploma, and having physical fitness. Firefighters earn $60,000 per annum on average. Library Assistant Library assistants play an integral role in society, serving the educational and career development needs of the local community. They provide educational resources, serve as administrators of the library, and host informative events. To be a library assistant you will need strong organizational skills, as you will need to stack books in a set sequential order, following the library cataloguing system known as the Dewey Decimal Classification. You will also need engaging interpersonal skills, clear communication, research skills, and be able to work independently as well as in a team. On average, library assistants earn $38,540. If you have identified a role above that you might be interested in, conduct some further research and speak to others who have experience working in those roles, so you can gain a better understanding and have well-informed expectations. This will also help you understand what the career progression trajectory looks like for the role in question. While prior experience or qualifications may not be a necessity, you can certainly gain a competitive edge in the hiring process through gaining relevant voluntary experience, studying a related field, and demonstrating your enthusiasm and commitment to the role of serving the public."

Such statements and information are current only as of November 2, 2023. From 3Q23 Earnings Release & Conference Call The long-term outlook for Quanta's business is positive. However, weather, regulatory, permitting, supply chain challenges and other factors impacting project timing and execution have impacted the company's historical results in the past and may impact future financial results. Additionally, we continue to consider future uncertainty associated with the overall challenges to the domestic and global economy, including inflation, increased interest rates and potential recessionary economic conditions.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following management's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability. You may begin. Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Sustainability, Assurant, Inc. Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2023 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the third quarter 2023. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with remarks from Keith and Richard, before moving into a Q&A session. Some of the statements made today are forward looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations, and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release and financial supplement, as well as in our SEC reports. During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement. I will now turn the call over to Keith. Keith Demmings, President & Chief Executive Officer, Assurant, Inc. Thanks, Suzanne. And good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the exceptionally strong results we achieved in the third quarter, with Adjusted EBITDA excluding catastrophes growing nearly 50% year-over- year or 19% on a year-to-date basis, both ahead of our expectations. Our results were largely driven by continued momentum in Global Housing, and our steadfast focus on executing our strategy, including driving innovation, creating efficiencies and strengthening our global partnerships. These efforts have positioned us to exceed our previous expectations of high single-digit Adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding catastrophes. We now expect Adjusted EBITDA growth of mid-to-high teens. Our year-to-date performance highlights Assurant's competitive differentiators, including our advantaged Global Housing and Global Lifestyle businesses that have proven leadership positions with scale and significant cash generation. Combined, these businesses are extending Assurant's track record of strong financial performance, thanks in part to the swift actions we've taken across our global operations to improve results and strengthen the business given broader macroeconomic headwinds. We continue to realize benefits from the actions we announced in 2022 to simplify our business and corporate real estate and realign our organizational structure, allowing us to reinvest throughout the enterprise. We extended our 2022 restructuring plan to include additional actions across the enterprise as we believe further enhancing Assurant's operational efficiency will support our long-term profitable growth and value creation. We now expect total restructuring costs associated with our extended plan to be between $90 million to $95 million pre-tax, above our previously announced expectations of $60 million to $65 million. Looking at our business segments, in Global Housing, I want to thank all of our employees who supported policyholders impacted by Hurricane Idalia and the Hawaii wildfires, as well as several other significant weather events during the quarter. Assurant plays a critical role in safeguarding our policyholders and supporting the U.S. mortgage industry. Our Global Housing Adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, more than doubled year-over-year and increased 72% year-to-date, led by significant growth in our Homeowners business through topline growth and improving loss experience. Our ability to quickly execute changes, particularly in our lender-placed business, has helped us gain earnings momentum from higher in-force policies, average insured values and state- approved rate increases following inflation impacts in 2022. Our performance so far this year highlights Global Housing's compelling and uniquely positioned portfolio. Year-to-date, including $89 million of reportable catastrophes, our combined ratio is 82% and our annualized ROE is 29%, demonstrating strong returns and cash generation. In our Renters business, we saw continued strength in our property management channel, where policies in-force have grown double digits this year. We continue to win new clients, grow existing partnerships and release new capabilities, including our upgraded leasing agent portal and digital insurance tracking enhancements. We're very pleased with Global Housing's strong performance year-to-date, which reflects our focused execution around streamlined product lines where we have a clear competitive advantage and scale. Turning to Global Lifestyle, third quarter earnings increased 7% year-over-year, or 14% excluding a onetime client benefit within Connected Living last year. Year-to-date, Adjusted EBITDA, down 6% versus the same period in 2022, has continued to improve throughout the year and is tracking in line with our expectations of a modest decline for the full year. Within Connected Living, we continue to support long-term growth through the development of innovative offerings, for our partners. U.S. Connected Living is poised for another year of solid growth, particularly within our mobile protection business, a testament to our breadth of innovative offerings, customer experience expertise, and deep relationships with mobile carriers and cable operators. As macroeconomic headwinds have persisted, including impacts from inflation, we've taken decisive action across our global operations to mitigate these impacts. In Europe, expense actions have allowed us to stabilize earnings as we focus on critical opportunities to grow our topline. We also continue to invest to advance product innovation and anticipate our clients' needs as well as improve customer experience through expanded service delivery capabilities. For example, as part of the extension of our 2022 plan to realize benefits and simplify our business and corporate real estate, we're consolidating our mobile device care centers into two sites in the U.S. We'll move the services currently offered in York, Pennsylvania, to our existing facility in Texas. Over time, we'll be investing in a new site, in Nashville, where we can leverage a strong talent market and greater logistics efficiencies as we evolve with emerging clients. Turning to our Global Auto business, we're beginning to see initial signs of claims improvement as a result of the decisive actions taken over the last year to improve performance. These actions included implementing rate increases on new policies across impacted clients and advancing opportunities to improve loss experience for programs where we hold the risk. We continue to monitor claims costs closely and expect improvement will be gradual over time given the way the Auto business earns. In Auto, we launched Assurant Vehicle Care at over 500 dealers. Building on decades of proprietary data on cost of claims, Assurant Vehicle Care is a comprehensive new suite of vehicle protection products. It was developed to help our dealer partners optimize product design, pricing, training and sales to ultimately enhance attachment and economics. For the consumer, Assurant Vehicle Care provides a digital experience with more vehicle coverage, flexibility and transparency. Now let's turn to our enterprise outlook and capital. Given our year-to-date results and our business outlook for the remainder of 2023, we now expect Adjusted EBITDA to grow mid-to-high teens, excluding catastrophes. Adjusted EPS growth is now expected to exceed Adjusted EBITDA growth, each excluding catastrophes. This is primarily due to higher earnings growth that now more than offsets the increase in depreciation expense. From a capital perspective, we upstreamed $202 million of segment dividends during the third quarter and $493 million year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with $491 million of holding company liquidity consistent with the end of the second quarter. In terms of share repurchases, during the third quarter, repurchases totaled $50 million. This brings our total repurchases to approximately $100 million for the year, including an additional $30 million of shares purchased through the end of October. Based on our strong year-to-date results, we expect fourth quarter buybacks to accelerate from third quarter levels and to be approximately $200 million for the year, consistent with our underlying repurchase activity in 2022. We're pleased with our strong capital position, which affords us more long-term flexibility over time. Looking to 2024, we expect a more modest level of earnings growth in Global Housing, excluding catastrophes, building on strong 2023 financial results, which included $40 million of favorable prior-year reserve development. In Global Lifestyle, we expect earnings growth to be led by Connected Living, particularly in the U.S., from the expansion of current programs, as we work to gradually improve the Auto business, which we will continue to manage closely. From a capital perspective, we're committed to maintaining flexibility for our strong balance sheet and deploying capital for share repurchases and opportunistic acquisitions to support our growth objectives. We will share our 2024 outlook in February factoring in our fourth quarter earnings, business trends, as well as the latest forecasts of the macro environment for the year. In the near-term, we're focused on achieving our 2023 objectives, and setting a path for continued growth and value creation in 2024 and beyond. As we look ahead, we remain committed to execution, innovation and enhancing the customer experience for our clients and their end consumers, particularly as we look to capitalize on growth opportunities, while supporting continued momentum. Before I turn the call over to Richard, to review the third quarter results and our 2023 outlook in greater detail, I want to once again thank our employees for their hard work and dedication to deliver for our clients. Our company was recently recognized as one of TIME's Best Companies in the World, highlighting Assurant's strong employee satisfaction, revenue growth and sustainability efforts. Assurant was also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's Greenest Companies, demonstrating our commitment to and progress in operating more sustainably. The recognition was timely as we recently introduced Carbon IQ by Assurant. This offering enables clients to see the carbon impact of each device, including new and refurbished devices, and provides them with estimated CO2 emissions throughout the supply chain and lifecycle to identify opportunities for reduction. We're honored to be recognized for our outstanding culture, products and sustainability, all of which help us better-serve our clients. And now, over to Richard. Richard Dziadzio, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Assurant, Inc. Thank you, Keith. For the third quarter of 2023, Adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $357 million, up $118 million, or nearly 50% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $4.68 for the quarter, delivering year-over- year growth of 67%. To review results in greater detail, let's start with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported Adjusted EBITDA of $192 million in the third quarter, an increase of $12 million or 7% year-over-year. As a reminder, prior period results included a one-time client benefit of $11 million within Connected Living. Excluding the prior period gain, Global Lifestyle's Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% or $24 million. This increase was primarily driven by higher contributions from investment income and mobile growth. Connected Living earnings increased $30 million or 32%, excluding the one-time client benefit, demonstrating strong mobile growth from North American device protection programs, from carrier and cable operator clients and better trade- in performance. Financial services also contributed to the growth. Trade-in results benefited from improved margins related to higher sales prices for used devices, partially offset by lower volumes impacted by the timing and structure of carrier promotions. In Europe, we stabilized performance through expense actions, mitigating the impact of headwinds that began in the second half of 2022. In Japan, results were impacted by subscriber decline, which is expected to continue into 2024. Global Auto Adjusted EBITDA declined $6 million or 8%. Results continue to be impacted by inflation of labor and parts leading to higher average claims costs. As expected, claims experience for Auto ancillary products has also contributed to higher incurred claims costs in the quarter. The Auto earnings decline was partially offset by an increase in investment income from higher yields and asset values. Turning to net earned premiums, fees and other income. Lifestyle was up by $83 million or 4%. This growth was primarily driven by Global Automotive, reflecting an increase of 6% from prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Connected Living's net earned premiums, fees and other income increased 3%. Growth was muted by the previously disclosed mobile program contract changes of approximately $55 million with no corresponding impacts to profitability. Excluding the impact of these contract changes, Connected Living's net earned premiums, fees and other income grew by 8%. The quarter benefited from higher prices on used mobile devices and modest growth in North America mobile subscribers excluding ongoing client runoff. Turning to the full year 2023, we continue to expect Lifestyle's Adjusted EBITDA to decline modestly. Global Auto will be down for the full year from unfavorable loss experience, including the impacts from continued normalization for select ancillary products previously mentioned. We've taken decisive actions this year in response to higher claims experience in our Auto book, including prospective rate increases and repair cost reduction. While we've seen some improvement, the improvement is expected to take place over a longer period of time given the earnings pattern of the business. In Connected Living, we expect our U.S. business to grow for the full year. Overall, we are pleased with Lifestyle's strong third quarter performance, especially in light of ongoing challenges in Auto claims. For the fourth quarter, we expect higher trade-in volumes in mobile, but we also expect ongoing topline challenges in Japan and Europe and investments to support business growth. In terms of full year net earned premiums, fees and other income, Lifestyle is expected to grow consistent with year-to-date trends. Moving to Global Housing, Adjusted EBITDA was $165 million, which included $26 million in reportable catastrophes, primarily from Hurricane Idalia and Hawaii wildfires. Excluding reportable catastrophes, Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $191 million, with an increase of $106 million. Housing performance was mainly led by three main items. First, continued topline growth in Homeowners from higher premium rates and average insured values in lender-placed, as well as an increase in the number of in-force policies. Second, favorable non-cat loss experience across the segment, including a year-over-year positive impact of $39 million related to prior period reserve development. This was comprised of $15 million of reserve reductions in the current quarter compared to reserve strengthening of $24 million in the prior period. And lastly, additional scale within our Homeowners expense base ultimately driving stronger operating leverage. Higher investment income also contributed to earnings growth for Homeowners. For Renters and others, earnings grew modestly from favorable prior period reserve development. Growth within the property management channel was offset by softer affinity channel volumes. For the full year 2023, we expect Global Housing Adjusted EBITDA excluding reportable cats, to grow significantly due to the strong Homeowners performance driven by topline expansion lender-placed and favorable non-cat loss experience. In the fourth quarter, we expect higher expenses to support business growth. In addition, the third quarter included $15 million of favorable prior period development. Moving to Corporate. The third quarter Adjusted EBITDA loss was $26 million, representing a modest year- over-year increase, mainly related to higher employee expenses. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect the Corporate Adjusted EBITDA loss to approximate $105 million. Turning to holding company liquidity, we ended the quarter with $491 million, and dividends from our operating segments totaled $202 million. In addition to cash used for corporate and interest expenses, third quarter cash outflows included three items, $50 million of share repurchases, $37 million for common stock dividends, and $50 million to complete the repayment of our September 2023 Notes. As Keith mentioned, given our year-to-date performance and outlook for the year as well as the strength of Assurant's balance sheet, we expect to achieve full year share repurchases of approximately $200 million. For the full year, we continue to expect our businesses to generate meaningful cash flows approximating 65% of segment Adjusted EBITDA, including reportable catastrophes. Cash flow expectations assume a continuation of the current economic environment and are subject to the growth of the businesses, investment portfolio performance and rating agency and regulatory requirements. In closing, through the resilience of our unique business model, the decisive management actions taken and our intense client focus, we are confident in our ability to achieve the higher full year objectives we have outlined today. And with that, Operator, please open the call for questions. QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION Operator:The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question is coming from the line of Mark Hughes of Truist. Your line is open. certainly haven't topped out in terms of the impact from the rate adjustments. But we do see it tapering and slowing certainly as we think about Q4 as we head into to 2024. But year-to-date, feel good with where our loss ratio sit. In Housing, we're 42% non-cat loss ratio, if you adjust for prior period development, very consistent with where we were last year. So we feel like the rates that we have are certainly appropriate. And as we see impacts on cost of claims we'll modify as we go forward. :Then the one final one. Your fee income was up in Lifestyle, your devices serviced were down 20% plus. I think you mentioned higher value per device. Anything else contributing to that? Just the divergence between the fee income and the devices serviced. :Yes. So, I think if we think about that year-over-year, certainly volumes are down. We saw softer promotional activity in the third quarter, not out of alignment with what we expected. We did see a pickup in the back half of September, obviously after new product introduced - introduction by Apple. So hopefully that sets us up with what we'd expect in the fourth quarter to be an improvement there. And as I look at that business, we've done a really nice job, in driving operational efficiency in automation to continue to improve the efficiency with which we operate. And then, as you said, we've gotten higher sale prices when we're selling devices. And obviously, we derive revenue based on how well we sell devices in the secondary market. But I'd say there's not much else to report. Profitability a little bit stronger. But if you'll remember, third quarter last year, we had a bit of a mismatch between expenses and revenue. So, Q3 trade-in results were a little bit depressed last year. :Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. think in June or July, but I guess 12% last year. So maybe kind of a mix there earning through. What's rate at? How much was the rate component? And how much was the unit growth component? I'm just trying to think of the different parts there. So maybe I can start and then certainly Richard can jump in. Obviously, when you look at Housing's revenue year-over-year, it's up meaningfully, $100 million, $103 million year-over-year. All of that is from growth in Homeowners, which is up 31% year-over-year, in terms of revenue. If we think about what's driving the performance, from an underlying EBITDA perspective, and Richard obviously talked about the prior period development, if you adjust the development, $15 million this year against an adverse development last year of $24 million, we still see a $67 million increase in our underlying EBITDA. And I would say two-thirds of that is really driven by rates, average insured values, which obviously play together and then, relatively stable losses related to higher levels of premium rolling through. And then the balance, maybe a third is split between policy growth, which is up 3.5% year-over- year, and then investment income, which is obviously helping with cash yields and more assets being held. But Richard, happy to have you add any other detail. :Yes, sure. Yes, that's exact. And I guess I would add and - by the way, good morning, Jeff. What I would add is that if you just look at the premium component that Keith just talked about, think about it generally as being a third for each of the components that we've just discussed. It's the increase in rates, average insured values, and inflation guard. That's sort of the way to look at it. And the other thing, too, that I would mention is, you see, I mean, you heard Keith talk about how much drops to the bottom line. I think that's also a credit to the expense discipline that we've had and the leverage we're getting. And you can see that coming out in the expense ratios that the growth in the premiums and the leverage that we have in the business is really allowing us to increase the bottom line. :Got it. Very helpful. And then in Global Lifestyle, just looking at that benefit ratio, kind of continues to move up despite rate increases. It was 23% in the quarter, mainly driven by Auto, it sounds like. Could you maybe just discuss the pricing strategy there? Like, when did that began, what level of pricing can you get in this market? Really, any detail on that would be helpful. :Yes, I can certainly start, Richard. So, if I think about the Auto business, actually pleased with the work done by our team, so we started making adjustments to rate late Attachments Disclaimer Assurant Inc.published this content on02 November 2023and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following management's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability. You may begin. Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Sustainability, Assurant, Inc. Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2023 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the third quarter 2023. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with remarks from Keith and Richard, before moving into a Q&A session. Some of the statements made today are forward looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations, and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release and financial supplement, as well as in our SEC reports. During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement. I will now turn the call over to Keith. Keith Demmings, President & Chief Executive Officer, Assurant, Inc. Thanks, Suzanne. And good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the exceptionally strong results we achieved in the third quarter, with Adjusted EBITDA excluding catastrophes growing nearly 50% year-over- year or 19% on a year-to-date basis, both ahead of our expectations. Our results were largely driven by continued momentum in Global Housing, and our steadfast focus on executing our strategy, including driving innovation, creating efficiencies and strengthening our global partnerships. These efforts have positioned us to exceed our previous expectations of high single-digit Adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding catastrophes. We now expect Adjusted EBITDA growth of mid-to-high teens. Our year-to-date performance highlights Assurant's competitive differentiators, including our advantaged Global Housing and Global Lifestyle businesses that have proven leadership positions with scale and significant cash generation. Combined, these businesses are extending Assurant's track record of strong financial performance, thanks in part to the swift actions we've taken across our global operations to improve results and strengthen the business given broader macroeconomic headwinds. We continue to realize benefits from the actions we announced in 2022 to simplify our business and corporate real estate and realign our organizational structure, allowing us to reinvest throughout the enterprise. We extended our 2022 restructuring plan to include additional actions across the enterprise as we believe further enhancing Assurant's operational efficiency will support our long-term profitable growth and value creation. We now expect total restructuring costs associated with our extended plan to be between $90 million to $95 million pre-tax, above our previously announced expectations of $60 million to $65 million. Looking at our business segments, in Global Housing, I want to thank all of our employees who supported policyholders impacted by Hurricane Idalia and the Hawaii wildfires, as well as several other significant weather events during the quarter. Assurant plays a critical role in safeguarding our policyholders and supporting the U.S. mortgage industry. Our Global Housing Adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, more than doubled year-over-year and increased 72% year-to-date, led by significant growth in our Homeowners business through topline growth and improving loss experience. Our ability to quickly execute changes, particularly in our lender-placed business, has helped us gain earnings momentum from higher in-force policies, average insured values and state- approved rate increases following inflation impacts in 2022. Our performance so far this year highlights Global Housing's compelling and uniquely positioned portfolio. Year-to-date, including $89 million of reportable catastrophes, our combined ratio is 82% and our annualized ROE is 29%, demonstrating strong returns and cash generation. In our Renters business, we saw continued strength in our property management channel, where policies in-force have grown double digits this year. We continue to win new clients, grow existing partnerships and release new capabilities, including our upgraded leasing agent portal and digital insurance tracking enhancements. We're very pleased with Global Housing's strong performance year-to-date, which reflects our focused execution around streamlined product lines where we have a clear competitive advantage and scale. Turning to Global Lifestyle, third quarter earnings increased 7% year-over-year, or 14% excluding a onetime client benefit within Connected Living last year. Year-to-date, Adjusted EBITDA, down 6% versus the same period in 2022, has continued to improve throughout the year and is tracking in line with our expectations of a modest decline for the full year. Within Connected Living, we continue to support long-term growth through the development of innovative offerings, for our partners. U.S. Connected Living is poised for another year of solid growth, particularly within our mobile protection business, a testament to our breadth of innovative offerings, customer experience expertise, and deep relationships with mobile carriers and cable operators. As macroeconomic headwinds have persisted, including impacts from inflation, we've taken decisive action across our global operations to mitigate these impacts. In Europe, expense actions have allowed us to stabilize earnings as we focus on critical opportunities to grow our topline. We also continue to invest to advance product innovation and anticipate our clients' needs as well as improve customer experience through expanded service delivery capabilities. For example, as part of the extension of our 2022 plan to realize benefits and simplify our business and corporate real estate, we're consolidating our mobile device care centers into two sites in the U.S. We'll move the services currently offered in York, Pennsylvania, to our existing facility in Texas. Over time, we'll be investing in a new site, in Nashville, where we can leverage a strong talent market and greater logistics efficiencies as we evolve with emerging clients. Turning to our Global Auto business, we're beginning to see initial signs of claims improvement as a result of the decisive actions taken over the last year to improve performance. These actions included implementing rate increases on new policies across impacted clients and advancing opportunities to improve loss experience for programs where we hold the risk. We continue to monitor claims costs closely and expect improvement will be gradual over time given the way the Auto business earns. In Auto, we launched Assurant Vehicle Care at over 500 dealers. Building on decades of proprietary data on cost of claims, Assurant Vehicle Care is a comprehensive new suite of vehicle protection products. It was developed to help our dealer partners optimize product design, pricing, training and sales to ultimately enhance attachment and economics. For the consumer, Assurant Vehicle Care provides a digital experience with more vehicle coverage, flexibility and transparency. Now let's turn to our enterprise outlook and capital. Given our year-to-date results and our business outlook for the remainder of 2023, we now expect Adjusted EBITDA to grow mid-to-high teens, excluding catastrophes. Adjusted EPS growth is now expected to exceed Adjusted EBITDA growth, each excluding catastrophes. This is primarily due to higher earnings growth that now more than offsets the increase in depreciation expense. From a capital perspective, we upstreamed $202 million of segment dividends during the third quarter and $493 million year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with $491 million of holding company liquidity consistent with the end of the second quarter. In terms of share repurchases, during the third quarter, repurchases totaled $50 million. This brings our total repurchases to approximately $100 million for the year, including an additional $30 million of shares purchased through the end of October. Based on our strong year-to-date results, we expect fourth quarter buybacks to accelerate from third quarter levels and to be approximately $200 million for the year, consistent with our underlying repurchase activity in 2022. We're pleased with our strong capital position, which affords us more long-term flexibility over time. Looking to 2024, we expect a more modest level of earnings growth in Global Housing, excluding catastrophes, building on strong 2023 financial results, which included $40 million of favorable prior-year reserve development. In Global Lifestyle, we expect earnings growth to be led by Connected Living, particularly in the U.S., from the expansion of current programs, as we work to gradually improve the Auto business, which we will continue to manage closely. From a capital perspective, we're committed to maintaining flexibility for our strong balance sheet and deploying capital for share repurchases and opportunistic acquisitions to support our growth objectives. We will share our 2024 outlook in February factoring in our fourth quarter earnings, business trends, as well as the latest forecasts of the macro environment for the year. In the near-term, we're focused on achieving our 2023 objectives, and setting a path for continued growth and value creation in 2024 and beyond. As we look ahead, we remain committed to execution, innovation and enhancing the customer experience for our clients and their end consumers, particularly as we look to capitalize on growth opportunities, while supporting continued momentum. Before I turn the call over to Richard, to review the third quarter results and our 2023 outlook in greater detail, I want to once again thank our employees for their hard work and dedication to deliver for our clients. Our company was recently recognized as one of TIME's Best Companies in the World, highlighting Assurant's strong employee satisfaction, revenue growth and sustainability efforts. Assurant was also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's Greenest Companies, demonstrating our commitment to and progress in operating more sustainably. The recognition was timely as we recently introduced Carbon IQ by Assurant. This offering enables clients to see the carbon impact of each device, including new and refurbished devices, and provides them with estimated CO2 emissions throughout the supply chain and lifecycle to identify opportunities for reduction. We're honored to be recognized for our outstanding culture, products and sustainability, all of which help us better-serve our clients. And now, over to Richard. Richard Dziadzio, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Assurant, Inc. Thank you, Keith. For the third quarter of 2023, Adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $357 million, up $118 million, or nearly 50% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $4.68 for the quarter, delivering year-over- year growth of 67%. To review results in greater detail, let's start with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported Adjusted EBITDA of $192 million in the third quarter, an increase of $12 million or 7% year-over-year. As a reminder, prior period results included a one-time client benefit of $11 million within Connected Living. Excluding the prior period gain, Global Lifestyle's Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% or $24 million. This increase was primarily driven by higher contributions from investment income and mobile growth. Connected Living earnings increased $30 million or 32%, excluding the one-time client benefit, demonstrating strong mobile growth from North American device protection programs, from carrier and cable operator clients and better trade- in performance. Financial services also contributed to the growth. Trade-in results benefited from improved margins related to higher sales prices for used devices, partially offset by lower volumes impacted by the timing and structure of carrier promotions. In Europe, we stabilized performance through expense actions, mitigating the impact of headwinds that began in the second half of 2022. In Japan, results were impacted by subscriber decline, which is expected to continue into 2024. Global Auto Adjusted EBITDA declined $6 million or 8%. Results continue to be impacted by inflation of labor and parts leading to higher average claims costs. As expected, claims experience for Auto ancillary products has also contributed to higher incurred claims costs in the quarter. The Auto earnings decline was partially offset by an increase in investment income from higher yields and asset values. Turning to net earned premiums, fees and other income. Lifestyle was up by $83 million or 4%. This growth was primarily driven by Global Automotive, reflecting an increase of 6% from prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Connected Living's net earned premiums, fees and other income increased 3%. Growth was muted by the previously disclosed mobile program contract changes of approximately $55 million with no corresponding impacts to profitability. Excluding the impact of these contract changes, Connected Living's net earned premiums, fees and other income grew by 8%. The quarter benefited from higher prices on used mobile devices and modest growth in North America mobile subscribers excluding ongoing client runoff. Turning to the full year 2023, we continue to expect Lifestyle's Adjusted EBITDA to decline modestly. Global Auto will be down for the full year from unfavorable loss experience, including the impacts from continued normalization for select ancillary products previously mentioned. We've taken decisive actions this year in response to higher claims experience in our Auto book, including prospective rate increases and repair cost reduction. While we've seen some improvement, the improvement is expected to take place over a longer period of time given the earnings pattern of the business. In Connected Living, we expect our U.S. business to grow for the full year. Overall, we are pleased with Lifestyle's strong third quarter performance, especially in light of ongoing challenges in Auto claims. For the fourth quarter, we expect higher trade-in volumes in mobile, but we also expect ongoing topline challenges in Japan and Europe and investments to support business growth. In terms of full year net earned premiums, fees and other income, Lifestyle is expected to grow consistent with year-to-date trends. Moving to Global Housing, Adjusted EBITDA was $165 million, which included $26 million in reportable catastrophes, primarily from Hurricane Idalia and Hawaii wildfires. Excluding reportable catastrophes, Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $191 million, with an increase of $106 million. Housing performance was mainly led by three main items. First, continued topline growth in Homeowners from higher premium rates and average insured values in lender-placed, as well as an increase in the number of in-force policies. Second, favorable non-cat loss experience across the segment, including a year-over-year positive impact of $39 million related to prior period reserve development. This was comprised of $15 million of reserve reductions in the current quarter compared to reserve strengthening of $24 million in the prior period. And lastly, additional scale within our Homeowners expense base ultimately driving stronger operating leverage. Higher investment income also contributed to earnings growth for Homeowners. For Renters and others, earnings grew modestly from favorable prior period reserve development. Growth within the property management channel was offset by softer affinity channel volumes. For the full year 2023, we expect Global Housing Adjusted EBITDA excluding reportable cats, to grow significantly due to the strong Homeowners performance driven by topline expansion lender-placed and favorable non-cat loss experience. In the fourth quarter, we expect higher expenses to support business growth. In addition, the third quarter included $15 million of favorable prior period development. Moving to Corporate. The third quarter Adjusted EBITDA loss was $26 million, representing a modest year- over-year increase, mainly related to higher employee expenses. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect the Corporate Adjusted EBITDA loss to approximate $105 million. Turning to holding company liquidity, we ended the quarter with $491 million, and dividends from our operating segments totaled $202 million. In addition to cash used for corporate and interest expenses, third quarter cash outflows included three items, $50 million of share repurchases, $37 million for common stock dividends, and $50 million to complete the repayment of our September 2023 Notes. As Keith mentioned, given our year-to-date performance and outlook for the year as well as the strength of Assurant's balance sheet, we expect to achieve full year share repurchases of approximately $200 million. For the full year, we continue to expect our businesses to generate meaningful cash flows approximating 65% of segment Adjusted EBITDA, including reportable catastrophes. Cash flow expectations assume a continuation of the current economic environment and are subject to the growth of the businesses, investment portfolio performance and rating agency and regulatory requirements. In closing, through the resilience of our unique business model, the decisive management actions taken and our intense client focus, we are confident in our ability to achieve the higher full year objectives we have outlined today. And with that, Operator, please open the call for questions. QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION Operator:The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.

Crews are continuing to search for missing people. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Less than three months after a deadly wildfire destroyed the town of Lahaina, all hotels in West Maui are now back open to the public. The original timeline was thought to be a little longer, occurring in three phases over an extended period of time. But last week, Maui Mayor Richard Bissen announced, somewhat spontaneously, that the entire coast would be permitted to reopen to visitors on November 1 in order to restore the economy and get people back to work. Visitation to Maui, and Hawaii in general, is down since the wildfires occurred in early August, and local projections estimate that it could take well into 2024 for those economic numbers to improve. The fires are a big reason why less people are visiting Maui, but mixed messaging is also an issue, according to recent reports by the Honolulu Star Advertiser. Indeed, it’s eye-popping to see how quickly media messaging can change in tourism. For example, in 2022, this article was published, citing concerns of overtourism and asking visitors to stay away from Maui. Flash forward a year, and this article spreads “a desperate plea” for tourists to return. These reactionary takes are partly the product of our modern-day media, but also one of the many pitfalls of a tourism dependent economy, where the life of local people always seems to be at odds with the flow of tourism. According to an article published by the Honolulu Star Advertiser on November 1st (“The Greatest Needs”), 56% of the fire victims are still in temporary housing, including hotels in West Maui. The three greatest needs expressed by these residents were financial recovery (26%), finding permanent housing (23%), and finding employment (9%). The hope is that the reopening of the hotels will entice the return of more visitors, which will in turn help provide jobs and financial recovery to the island. Hotels and tourism stakeholders are obviously pleased by the news, since they previously lacked a clear timetable. If you plan to visit Maui in the near future, I recommend heeding some advice to help make your trip as mutually beneficial as possible."

She was honoured during an awards ceremony at St. Patrick High School. When Madeleine Caza, 15, was woken by her brother, Luke Caza, 13, early one August morning to alert her that their father, Michel Caza, 47, was unresponsive and not breathing, the siblings ran to their parents’ bedroom to help. Their mother, Clare Caza, had already started performing CPR and was on the phone with the 911 operator. Madeleine was trained through the ACT High School CPR and AED Program, which aims to see all students empowered to save lives. With the 911 operator’s guidance, Madeleine and Luke quickly placed Michel on the floor, and Madeleine took over performing CPR until firefighters arrived. Luke ran downstairs to wake their older brother, Christian Caza, 17, and let firefighters into the house. “I was able to save my dad’s life because of the training,” said Madeleine. “How can you ever thank them enough?” said Michel. “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them and the ACT High School CPR and AED Program.” The ACT Foundation set up the ACT High School CPR and AED Program in six schools in Thunder Bay and surrounding communities with the support of provincial partners Hydro One and the Government of Ontario, ACT’s health partners, AstraZeneca Canada and Amgen Canada, and community partners. More than 17,300 students have been trained in CPR to date by their teachers. “Hydro One is proud to help fund ACT’s life-saving program,” said Doug Rivard, Distribution Superintendent for the Provincial Lines Team, Hydro One. “The heroic efforts of Madeleine show that the work ACT is doing in schools across the province is making a life-changing impact on the students they train. It is imperative for the health and safety of a community that young people have the tools and the confidence they need to quickly respond to a medical emergency.” ACT is a national charitable foundation dedicated to establishing CPR and AED training in Canadian high schools. ACT has trained more than 2.9 million youth across Ontario. ACT establishes High School CPR and AED Programs, where teachers are trained to teach students the following: how to recognize a life-threatening medical emergency; safety issues and emergency scene management; CPR and how to use an AED; and how to respond to a suspected opioid overdose, a new aspect of the program through additional funding support from Hydro One (announced in November 2022), as well as a contribution from Health Canada and ACT’s health partners. “As a founding partner of the ACT Foundation, we’re so proud to continue supporting its goal of establishing CPR and defibrillator training in Canadian high schools, providing youth with critical life-saving skills, and raising awareness of the importance of cardiovascular health. The quick action Madeleine took to save the life of her father is incredibly inspiring and a testament to the impact of the ACT High School CPR and AED Program,” said Kiersten Combs, President at AstraZeneca Canada. “Amgen is honoured to support the ACT Foundation as a National Health Partner. Rescue stories are a testament to the quality of the program and the criticality of ensuring that the education community is equipped with the knowledge and skills to contribute. Together we will continue to advance excellence in science literacy, inspire the next generation, help educators to teach more effectively, and improve access to resources for teachers, students, and society at large,” said Ugur Gunaydin, General Manager of Amgen Canada “We are incredibly proud to honour Madeleine with the ACT Rescuer Award for using the skills and knowledge learned through the ACT High School CPR and AED Program to help save her father’s life,” said Sandra Clarke, Executive Director, the ACT Foundation. “The program teaches youth how to take charge and help in a life-threatening medical emergency, while also teaching leadership, civic responsibility, and building their self-esteem — and Madeleine demonstrates all the above.” To read the full rescue story,click here.

The estimate is presented in an articlepublishedinFire.The area destroyed by that year's disastrous fires was far larger than had been thought, according to the article. Previous estimates ranged from 14,307 km² to 36,017 km². Led by scientists at the National Space Research Institute (INPE) in Brazil, the study included construction of a model based on satellite images from the European Space Agency's SENTINEL-2 satellite, which was shown to estimate regional-scale burned areas with significantly greater precision and accuracy than other satellite-based models for the Pantanal.The approach used in the study achieved 96% accuracy, and the results ""will help to improve estimates of trace gases and aerosols associated with biomass burning,"" the authors note, adding that ""global biomass burning inventories are widely known for having biases at a regional scale.""The findings highlight the need for approaches that better assess the influence of fire on ecosystems and biodiversity in regions critically sensitive to climate change, such as the Pantanal. Their importance is all the greater in light of the strength of this year's El Niño, which could make the northern portion of the Pantanal and adjacent areas in the Upper Paraguay Basin drier and more susceptible to fire.""The results of the study don't show one model or product to be better than another. Every method has its own strengths and limitations. Estimates tend to vary significantly as a result. However, the images furnished by the MSI [Multispectral Instrument] on board SENTINEL-2 have two positive points:spatial resolutionis 20 meters, providing much better detail of burned areas; and temporal resolution, very important to this type of study, is 5 days, compared with a revisit frequency of up to 16 days for the Landsats,"" said forest engineer Andeise Cerqueira Dutra, an author of the article and a Ph.D. candidate at INPE's Earth Observation and Geoinformatics Division (DIOTG), with Yosio Edemir Shimabukuro as thesis advisor.Shimabukoro is the penultimate author of the article. The last author is Guilherme Augusto Verola Mataveli, also a researcher at DIOTG-INPE.For Mataveli, it is important to refine this type of analysis and obtain regional-scale estimates in order not only to estimate burned areas more accurately but also to calculate greenhouse gas emissions, which directly affectclimate change.""The 2020 Pantanal fire crisis was caused by anextreme drought. Severe drought will tend to be increasingly frequent there and in other parts of Brazil. Knowing more about the impact of these extreme weather events on the biome and its biodiversity will be more and more important to decisions regarding fire management and fire mitigation programs,"" said Mataveli.""Finding ways to improve these products and generate moreaccurate datais very important for society. An example is the pilot project launched this year in the Pantanal, also using remote sensing data to identify areas affected by fire and estimate the accumulation of combustible matter. Managers of environmental agencies and firefighters can use these findings to manage fire in an integrated manner, defining priority areas and actions to combat or control fires,"" Dutra said.ConsequencesThe Pantanal is normally under water in the rainy season, which extends roughly between October and May, and is modulated by the South American Monsoon System (SAMS). The dry season usually begins in June or July. Fires in the region tend to peak in September. However, the pattern changed in 2019, which saw the onset of a prolonged drought that worsened in 2020, when annual precipitation in the Brazilian portion of the Pantanal was the lowest since the 1980s and 26% lower than the 1982–2020 average.As a result, the water surface area shrank 34% compared with the average, the aggregate burned area was 200% more than the long-term average, and 35% burned for the first time on record.The cost of restoration was estimated at USD 123 million. Researchers estimated that the 2020 wildfires killed some 16 millionsmall animals(under 2 kg) and 944,000 larger animals.The Jaguar (Panthera onca), the largest feline species in the Americas, wasespecially hard hit. The fires destroyed 45% of the estimated population of P. onca, or some 450 individuals (87% in Brazil), burning 79% of its home range area and 54% of protected areas within that range. Until then, the Pantanal was home to the second-largest population of jaguars in the world.Another consequence was a rise in the number of people hospitalized for treatment of respiratory problems in the states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, as shown by astudy(in Portuguese) conducted by Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), an arm of Brazil's Health Ministry.MethodologyThe researchers usedsatellite imagesfrom SENTINEL-2 to estimate burned areas in the Brazilian part of the Pantanal in 2020 and compared these with estimates based on MODIS (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensors aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites) and Landsat imaging. The former (MCD64A1 and Fire_cci) gave estimates of 35,837 km² and 36,017 km² respectively, while the latter (MapBiomas Fogo and GABAM) gave estimates of 23,372 km² and 14,307 km².The spatial distribution patterns in these maps were visually similar, but the estimates based on SENTINEL-2 imaging detected a larger number of smaller fires, especially in the eastern Pantanal. ""The model we developed is available to anyone interested, as is the data collected in the validation exercise. We believe they can help researchers engaged in future projects,"" Mataveli said.""Drought is set to be increasingly frequent, andfireepisodes therefore will tend to be more frequent as well, so we expect more collaborative research and a growing supply of data,"" Dutra said. ""We also expect more field data to be accessible, especially for scientists who work with remote sensing to produce more accurate output.""Between January 1 and August 23, 2023, 381 fires were detected in the Pantanal, according todatafrom INPE (in Portuguese). In the same period of 2020, there were 8,127, the highest number since 1998 for the biome. Forest fires have intensified this year in the context of heat waves in Europe and North America, leaving many deaths and ruined neighborhoods in their wake."

NEW ORLEANS — At least seven people were killed after a ""superfog"" of smoke from south Louisiana marsh fires and dense fog caused multiple massive car crashes Monday morning involving a total of 158 vehicles, authorities said. Twenty-five people were injured and the number of fatalities may increase as first responders continue to clear the crash scenes and search for victims, Louisiana State Police said in a press release Monday evening. Gov. John Bel Edwards issued a call for blood donors and asked for prayers ""for those hurt and killed."" Videos of the wreck showed what looked like an endless junkyard of cars overtaking the busy interstate near the community of Manchac. Vehicles were crushed, rammed under one another and some were engulfed by flames. Many people stood on the side of the road looking in disbelief at the disastrous scene, while others remained in their car waiting for aid. Christopher Coll, 41, was among the drivers in one of the pileups. ""I was already on the brakes, slowing down when an F-250 drove up on top of my work trailer and took me for a ride,"" Coll toldThe Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate. Coll could smell smoke as he heard other drivers calling for help and the sounds of crashing cars and popping tires. He was able to kick open his passenger door to escape and then helped others — pulling out one person through a car window. Clarencia Patterson Reed was also in the wave of wrecked cars as she drove to Manchac with her wife and niece. Reed told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate said that she could see people waving their hands for her to stop, but when she did her car was hit from behind and on the side by two other vehicles. ""It was 'Boom. Boom.' All you kept hearing was crashing for at least 30 minutes,"" Reed said. She was able to scramble out of her car, but her wife was pinned inside and injured her leg and side. Louisiana State Police shared aerial photos on their Facebook page showing dozens of crashed cars and extensive debris on both northbound and southbound lanes of the elevated interstate, which passes over swamp and open waters between lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas. As of Monday afternoon, state troopers were still working ""to notify families, investigate the exact causes of the crashes"" and coordinate with the state's transportation department to have the bridge inspected. Traffic backed up for miles in both directions on I-55. The lack of visibility also prompted closures of parts of I-10 and the 24-mile (39-kilometer) Lake Pontchartrain Causeway at times. School buses were summoned to transport stranded motorists from the accident sites. At midday, state police told reporters at the scene that one vehicle went over the highway guardrail and into the water, but the driver escaped unharmed. On social media, theNational Weather Service saidthere were multiple wetland fires in the region. Smoke from the fires mixed with fog to create a ""superfog."" Visibility improved as the fog lifted, according to the agency. But it was unclear how long the marsh fires, smoke from which could be seen and smelled in the New Orleans areaover the weekend, would be a factor. The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocatereportedseveral schools in and near New Orleans announced class cancellations or delayed openings due to the smoke and fog. Smoke from the Bayou Sauvage Urban National Wildlife Refuge was thick enough that the city announced locations where free masks could be picked up in eastern New Orleans and in the Algiers neighborhood on the west bank of the Mississippi River."

According to an Oct. 10announcement, Google showcased several new projects and expansions demonstrating how technology can empower systemic change to combat climate change globally during its Sustainable with Google event on October 10. In the transportation sector, a significant contributor to emissions, Google announced expanding its Project Green Light traffic optimization initiative. The project usesartificial intelligence(AI) to analyze traffic patterns and optimize traffic light timing to reduce stop-and-go driving. By creating “green waves” where cars can drive through multiple coordinated intersections without stopping, Green Light aims to cut emissions from acceleration and braking. Early data from Green Light’s 70 optimized intersections in 12 global cities shows the potential to reduce stops by 30% and lower carbon emissions at intersections by 10%. With 30 million potential car trips impacted per month, scaled adoption could significantly reduce urban transportation emissions. Google plans Green Light expansions to more cities worldwide this year. Fuel-efficient routing now covers India and Indonesia,helping citizens reduce gas usage. In France, Google Maps will soon display walking and transit routes alongside driving to highlight greener choices. Google’s goal is to influence over 1 billion people worldwide to choose more sustainable travel through its products. Google also highlighted projects focused on transitioning global energy usage to renewable sources. Updates to Google Search will provide more information on home renewable heating and cooling to educate consumers. Google is also improving access to AI-powered grid planning tools for utilities, like Project Tapestry in Chile. Using robust modeling of factors like weather disruptions, these tools can aid the complex process of transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy generation. Finally, Google discussed leveraging its AI capabilities to help communities adapt to intensifying climate change impacts. Flood forecasting on Google’s Flood Hub platform now covers the U.S. and Canada, providing advanced warning to over 12 million residents. A new wildfire spread prediction model developed with the U.S. Forest Service will provide one of the first AI-powered upgrades to wildfire simulation in 50 years. Google is also expanding its urban tree canopy and cool roof mapping to thousands of cities to support heat mitigation planning. According to Google parent company Alphabet’s CEO Sundar Pichai, the company aims to continue developing insights and tools to help individuals, cities, and organizations to make progress toward a carbon-free future. With climate change an urgent “moonshot” challenge, expanding access to climate-focused technologies will be key to enabling the requirement of global-scale emission reductions.

However, Professor Delphine Farmer said the research also shows that simple surface cleaning—like vacuuming, dusting or mopping—can reduce exposure and limit risk.The research illustrates the hidden and persistent health threats many in the Western U.S. are facing given the increase in wildfires over the last decade, she said.""This research shows that events like the Marshall Fire in Colorado, the wildfires in Canada and the recent fires in Hawaii present serious exposure potential—not just when they occur but well after,"" said Farmer, who is based in the Department of Chemistry at CSU. ""This paper is a key initial step towards providing actionable and practical information on how to protect yourself and clean your home.""To better understand how smoke enters and then stays in buildings, researchers burned pine wood chips in a net zero energy residential testing facility operated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Maryland. That facility is frequently used to study how different systems impact the ways energy, water and air move through a single-family house. The detailed instrumentation available for that work was perfectly suited to this research, said Dustin Poppendieck, an environmental researcher at NIST who helped coordinate the project.Researchers at Colorado State University worked with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to test how wildfire smoke lingers on surfaces in homes like carpet despite initial cleaning activity. Their findings were published inScience Advances.

Credit: John Eisele/Colorado State University Photography""The NIST Net Zero House allowed the researchers to track the movement and transformation of chemicals in the air and onto surfaces in real time using instruments in ways that don't interfere with the behavior of the smoke,"" said Poppendieck.Those smoke injection sessions occurred regularly over several days, and Farmer said the total amount applied was comparable or slightly under the particulate levels seen during the Canadian wildfires. The team then took careful measurements of air quality levels and surface conditions after opening exterior doors and windows, cleaning and use of the home's built-in air cleaning systems.The CSU team was particularly interested in the gas-phase of compounds developing from the smoke, while other teams from the University of California San Diego, CU Boulder and the University of North Carolina Chapple Hill explored different phases and interactions across the home. The team then compared findings between states to confirm what was actually happening in the home after the burn.Farmer said findings from this interdisciplinary research approach could also be applicable to other large air pollution events like the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, where the same principles of compounds sticking to surfaces are likely to occur.Because there has not been a lot of similar indoor air research, the team leaned on previous findings from others around the effects of cigarette smoke to inform their approach. Farmer said burning nicotine causes specific compounds with well-known health concerns and that the comparison to their project findings was informative.""Nicotine reacts on surfaces to create a particularly nasty set of compounds called nitrosamines, which is where the real concern from third-hand smoke that is left behind comes from,"" she said. ""Whereas with wildfire smoke, we found there was a huge diversity of organic compounds that stick to surfaces, which then slowly bleed off.""The amount, persistence and variety of compounds from the wildfire smoke in each case could potentially change the recommended approaches for cleaning the indoor spaces. Farmer said that is an area of research the team hopes to explore in the future.Delphine Farmer. Credit: John Eisele/Colorado State University PhotographyResearcher cleaning the house during testing. Credit: John Eisele/Colorado State University PhotographyFor now, she said the team was able to show that the amount of smoke left on surfaces was proportional to thesurfacearea that was cleaned. That means simple cleaning and specifically addressing large but little noticed spaces that may trap harmful compounds such as cabinets and HVAC systems could be beneficial right away.""As we continue this research, we would like to know just how effective different cleaning approaches are and when residents should move from relatively simple steps like using commercial cleaning supplies for mopping to more drastic steps like replacing the drywall altogether,"" Farmer said.Farmer's team was also recently funded to research how smog may enter and remain in the home in much the same way as wildfire smoke. That work will be particularly important in Colorado where ground-level ozone pollution is a continuing issue.""In the future I want to explore how the economics of making a more energy efficient building play into these questions and help people understand the risks and potential solutions available to them,"" Farmer said. ""CSU is well positioned to lead this kind of interdisciplinary work and address the practical implications because of the land-grant service mission that drives our university."""

More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm. Some children, like 10-year-old Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim, are already on the move. Her family left their home in Somalia after dawn prayers on a Saturday morning five months ago. The worst drought in more than 50 years scorched the once-fertile pastures the family relied on, leaving them barren. So, bundling only a few clothes and some utensils into sacks, they moved to a camp in the capital Mogadishu, where Ibrahim, who dreams of being a doctor, is now going to school for the first time. That’s a plus, but the camp lacks proper shelter and sanitation, and food is scarce. “We need something that can protect us from the heat during the day and the cold at night,” Ibrahim said. The miseries of long, drawn-out disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report — more than half of them in Somalia — but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no pre-emptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide, climate change has already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines; storms are battering megacities and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. “The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in (the) future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify,” said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the report's authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 2016-21 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. Floods displaced children more than 19 million times in places like India and China. Wildfires impacted children 810,000 times in the U.S. and Canada. Data tracking migrations because of weather extremes typically don't differentiate between children and adults. UNICEF worked with a Geneva-based nonprofit, the International Displacement Monitoring Center, to map where kids were most impacted. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. Those countries also have vast populations and strong systems to evacuate people, which makes it easier for them to record data. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring “overlapping crises” — where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. During unprecedented flooding of the Yamuna River in July in the Indian capital New Delhi, churning waters washed away the hut that was home to 10-year-old Garima Kumar’s family. The waters also took her school uniform and her school books. Kumar lived with her family on sidewalks of the megacity and missed a month of school. “Other students in the school teased me because my house had been flooded. Because we don’t have a permanent home,” Kumar said. The floodwaters have receded and the family began repairing their home last month — a process Garima’s mother Meera Devi said they are having to do over and over again as floods are becoming more common. Her father, Shiv Kumar, hasn’t had any work for over a month. The family's only income is the mother’s $2 daily earnings as a domestic helper. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnam-based expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasn’t involved with the report. “When you’re desperate, you do things that you normally wouldn’t do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they don’t have the ability to stand up for themselves,” she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become “shock-responsive, portable and inclusive,” to help children and their families better cope with disasters. This would mean considering children’s needs at different stages, from ensuring they have opportunities to study, that they can stay with their families and that eventually they can find work. “We have the tools. We have the knowledge. But we’re just not working fast enough,” Healy said. ___ Ghosal reported from Hanoi, Vietnam, Fassett reported from Seattle.

According to the analysis, China and the Philippines are among the countries that recorded the highest absolute numbers of child displacements, due to their exposure to extreme weather, large child populations and progress made on early warning and evacuation capacities. However, relative to the size of the child population, children living in small island states, such as Dominica and Vanuatu, were most affected by storms , while children in Somalia and South Sudan were most affected by floods . Floods and storms accounted for 40.9 million, or 95 per cent, of recorded child displacements between 2016 and 2021. Meanwhile, droughts triggered more than 1.3 million internal displacements of children - with Somalia again among the most affected, while wildfires triggered 810,000 child displacements, with more than a third occurring in 2020 alone. Canada, Israel and the US recorded the most. The report also said that riverine floods have the potential to displace almost 96 million children over the next 30 years, based on current climate data, while cyclonic winds and storm surges have the potential to displace 10.3 million and 7.2 million children respectively, over the same period. ""It is terrifying for any child when a ferocious wildfire, storm or flood barrels into their community,"" said Unicef Executive Director Catherine Russell. ""For those who are forced to flee, the fear and impact can be especially devastating, with worry of whether they will return home, resume school, or be forced to move again."" "

Their why:One of the plaintiffs, Badge Busse, 15, toldMontana Public Radio's Ellis Juhlin, ""this is our land as much as it is any other people's. And we just want to protect it, protect it for our kids and for ourselves."" ""It's kind of like a melancholy feeling for me going into it,"" his brother and fellow plaintiff, Lander Busse, explained.

Listen to the full interview. As Colorado Public Radio's Miguel Otárola explains: Back in 2020, during one of Colorado's worst wildfire years in recorded history, firefighters asked Elizabeth Velasco if her small translation agency could help translate emergency alerts into Spanish. She jumped at the opportunity,translating dozens of press releasesand signing a contract to translate for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Velasco, 35, is now a certified wildland firefighter and has served as a public information officer for megafires in California and Oregon. Her why:""The more barriers that we can remove for people to engage,"" Velasco told CPR, ""that's going to just make us stronger."" In 2021, Colorado decided it wantedto address and prevent the disproportionate impacts of pollution and climate changeon low-income, Black, Latino and Indigenous people. Last year, Velasco was elected to represent Glenwood Springs, Colo., in the state House. Velasco told CPR that to her, ""environmental justice means not leaving anyone behind.

Soil scientist at Oregon State University (and bassist in the '80s rock band Information Society). AsOPB's Michael Bendixen reports, rock stardom to soil science seems like a circuitous path, but Cassidy says the magic is all about the soil. The Earth is losing topsoil at an alarming rate, which is a big problem. ""Every molecule in your body has been through the soil billions of times, and the fact that you're not soil at this moment is a temporary condition,"" he says. ""It's all about the soil."" Cassidy encourages people to think of soil not as a thing but as an active process; not as a noun, but as a verb. A post shared by James Cassidy (@jamescassidy57) On his why:""When we lose agriculture, we don't have anything to eat,"" Cassidy says. ""All culture comes from agriculture. All civilizations come from agriculture. We will eventually return to the soil."" And organic matter is key: The more organic matter in the system, the more it creates an environment for the soil to have even more. It's exponential. ""When you increase organics by 1%, you can store 25,000 gallons more water per acre in that soil,"" Cassidy says. ""No matter who I meet or what their worldview is, no matter how divided we are, it's really our common ground: We all need soil to survive,"" he says. Loading... Archaeologist and manager, Garden of the Gods Park, Colorado Springs, Colo. LISTEN: Born and raised in Colorado Springs, Anna Cordova says her Indigenous background and archaeology experience are central to herstewardship of the city's most popular park. KRCC's Jess Hazel spoke to Cordova about the meaning of stewardship now and for future generations: ""I always joke that Garden of the Gods Park does not need a manager. The park itself doesn't need a manager. The people that come to the park do. And so just trying to figure out how to balance the resources with visitation and making sure that people can come here and enjoy it and fall in love with it just as much as so many millions of people have already done and how citizens of Colorado Springs have already done."" On her journey to this work:""I went into archaeology, even as an 18-year-old student, with the idea that Indigenous voices needed to be heard more and that it was a very colonial kind of practice. ... I remember there weren't a whole lot of Indigenous voices represented in archaeology. At least not published and things like that. I think it's very empowering, too, to be able to interpret your own history and not have other people do it for you. Archaeology also lends to how we manage and steward places now. That tribal consultation is not just about archaeology, it's about how we go forward into the future and how we do things in the present. So it's all connected and all extremely important to me.""

TV meteorologist Chris Gloninger didn't just want to warn people about the latest record-breaking storm — he wanted to talk about the changing climate amplifying it: ""I truly believe it is the existential crisis of our lifetime, and that's why I think it's so important to do it."" On his why:Gloninger believes it's the job of meteorologists to keep people safe, and that interrupting regularly scheduled programming with a breaking weather alert is just one way they can do that. ""Climate change isn't an opinion, it's fact-based science. But at the same point, if your ideas differ from somebody else's, just be kind. Don't go on the offensive and attack,"" he says. ""We can live life with more love, kindness and compassion ... and we can all become better in that."" Gloninger — the chief meteorologist for CBS affiliate KCCI-TV in Des Moines, Iowa — has brought that mindset to seven television stations across five states during his 18-year career, earning him both praise and pushback. Earlier this year, he announced he was ""bidding farewell to TV to embark on a new journey dedicated to helping solve the climate crisis."" The reasons, he said, were ""a death threat stemming from my climate coverage last year and resulting PTSD, in addition to family health issues."" ""I'm not giving up,"" he told NPR's Rachel Treisman. ""I'm just switching roles to do even more of it.""

Chairwoman of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council who campaigned for sacred sites along California's coast to be a marine sanctuary. What could soon be the largest national marine sanctuary in the continental U.S. is the result of a campaign that started in 2015, when Walker's father nominated the area. The central California coast, with its rugged beaches and kelp forests, draws a lot of visitors for its scenic beauty. For the Chumash people, the coastline means a lot more. ""Almost all the places people like to go to are our sacred sites,""Walker told NPR's Lauren Sommer. ""We've been going there and praying and doing ceremony there for 20,000 years."" Walker says restoring their connection to the coast is a big part of bringing back Chumash culture. When a liquified natural gas terminal was proposed for Point Conception, an angular piece of land that juts into the Pacific, tribal members occupied the site to protest the project. ""We believe when all people exit this world, they exit at Point Conception,"" Walker says. ""Protecting that site is a spiritual connection for us. The same as any other religion protects their icons, their religious symbols, that's ours."" Establishing theChumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuarywould also mean the waters are largely protected from development, like oil rigs and wind turbines.

In addition to ash that blankets lakes and rivers,soil erosioncaused by the loss of vegetation alterswater quality.""Lakes with clear,clear waterin the Canadian Shield will fill with algae which will suck the oxygen from the water, so there will be less for the animals,"" Langlois explains, referring to a large area of exposed rock.The chemical composition of wildfiresmoke particlesis also different from particles from other sources of pollution, such as car emissions or industrial pollution.It contains a greater proportion of carbon-based pollutants in various chemical forms that are sometimes deposited hundreds of kilometers from the fires.These fumes have acute or chronic effects on the health of wildlife, says Matthew Mitchell of the University of British Columbia.Forests west of Quebec, Canada were ravaged as part of the country's record fire season this summer.""Young animals are often more susceptible to the effects of smoke, as are humans,"" he adds, and ""evenmarine animalslike whales and dolphins are affected when they emerge to breathe.""In Canada, nearly 700 species are already considered threatened, largely due to habitat destruction from logging and other encroachment.Over the longterm, wildfires constitute an additional threat to wildlife.This is the case for caribou. This Canadian emblem which lives in old forests , feeding on lichen, is unlikely to bounce back for several years from the ravages of fires.""If the moose is likely to do well, the caribou will do less well, given that it is in a rather precarious situation,"" worries Gabriel Pigeon, professor at the University of Quebec in Abitibi-Temiscamingue.The fires could also accentuate a phenomenon already observed by researchers and linked toclimate changeand the upheaval of ecosystems: certain species have moved north.Thus is the case for a lynx that Pigeon follows using a radio collar. It has taken refuge 300 kilometers (185 miles) from its territory while its home range is generally 25 square kilometers.The return of animals to burned areas will vary from one species to another.

Controlled burns, also … [+4079 chars]",United States,"Shifting weather patterns caused by climate change are limiting when controlled burns can be carried out to prevent wildfires in the western United States, a new study warns.Controlled burns, also known as prescribed fires, are a tool to preemptively dispose of combustible vegetation with the goal of preventing larger, uncontrolled fires.But they are only possible under specific conditions—so-called burn windows—when undergrowth is neither so dry it risks burning out of control nor so damp it won't burn at all.The number of burn windows in a year varies by region and climate, but conditions are generally best in spring or autumn in the western United States, the region covered by the study.To examine howclimate changemight affect that, scientists from the University of California and Washington State University used computer modeling.They looked how many days a year met burn window conditions historically, and how that might change in a ""moderate warming"" scenario of a two-degree Celsius temperature increase.Despite regional variations, they found a clear trend, with suitable days already decreasing and likely to do so further.In the southern part of the area studied, the number of lost days in decades ahead ranged from 15 to 30 a year, with smaller decreases further north.In localized areas, modeling showed small increases in the number of suitable days, though the paper warns those gains may be temporary.That's because whiledry conditionscan initially make circumstances more favorable in damp areas, eventually the balance can tip and leave vegetation too dry to burn safely.""Contemporary practitioners of prescribed fire are operating under climate and vegetation conditions that are increasingly outside the envelope of historical experience,"" the authors wrote.The paper was published Tuesday inCommunications Earth and Environment, a Nature journal.Australian firefighters have been carrying out controlled burns ahead of bushfire season.'Acceptable trade-offs'The findings offer some hope that shifting policies could address shrinking burn windows.The authors note that winter, while not currently a time used for prescribedburnsin the region, should stay as favorable, or become even more so in some areas.That supports calls ""for an expanded year-round fire management workforce whose responsibilities extend beyond fighting wildfires to also encompass the management of prescribedfire,"" the authors wrote.One complicating factor is the smoke generated by controlled fires, with burn windows currently dictated in part by the likelihood of burning affecting local residents.The researchers found ""low-level stagnation""—a combination of wind and rain patterns—is likely to increase with climate change.That could further constrain policymakers, who are generally keen to limit burning at times when it could leave smoke sitting over local communities.The authors suggested policymakers need to weigh the potentially greater air pollution risks if wildfires erupt.""Greater tolerance of dispersed smoke emissions from prescribed fires may potentially be deemed an acceptable trade-off to reduce the risk of extreme air pollution episodes resulting from catastrophic wildfire smoke events.""While the study only covers the western United States, wildfires have ravaged areas from Greece to Indonesia this year.Australia carried out controlled burning earlier this month in preparation for a looming bushfire season.Unusually wet conditions this year have produced large amounts of undergrowth that experts fear could contribute to the worst bushfire season since the country's 2019-2020 ""Black Summer""."

But new research outlines a small reason for optimism. Scientists project that even though climate change will make the world hotter, snow may actually become brighter and whiter. This more-reflective snow could help offset some of the ill effects of the climate crisis and slow down the rate of melting for snowpack. A study published this month in the journal Nature Communications found that snow will likely become cleaner and brighter by the end of this century due to falling rates of black carbon pollution. Warmer temperatures will contribute to higher rates of snowmelt, but cleaner snow, brighter snow should reflect sunlight away from an area—sending heat back into space instead of absorbing it. For the study, scientists with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory looked at multiple factors that affect snowpack, including increasing global temperatures, pollution, and the shape of the snow grains. They studied snowpack trends in high mountain ranges in the Northern Hemisphere from 1995 to 2014. Using that data, researchers then modeled snowpack trends for two different emissions scenarios on mountains in the Western U.S. and the Tibetan Plateau from 2015 to 2100. In the scenario where we don’t cut our fossil fuel consumption, the world will get hotter and snowpack loss will increase up to 58% compared to today. However, cleaner snow would reduce the rate of snow loss by about 8%, researchers wrote. In an optimistic scenario, where we get our emissions under control, there’s less global warming and more snowpack. In that scenario, researchers estimated a snowpack loss of roughly 15% compared to current levels. In both scenarios, particle pollution known as black carbon is expected to decrease. This form of pollution often comes from fossil fuel energy sources, including gas-powered engines and coal-fired power plants, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. With fewer sooty dark particles falling to the ground, the snow will be cleaner and brighter than it is today by the end of this century. “Snow is not just snow,” Dalei Hao, a study author, said in a statement. “There’s clean snow and there’s dirty snow, and how they respond to sunlight is very different.” Pollution particles settle on top of the snowpack, making it darker. Darker snow absorbs sunlight, which makes snow melt faster. Cleaner snow is whiter and reflects sunlight back into space, helping regulate temperatures and maintain the snowpack for longer during the winter. Clean snowmelt is also important for the many people who rely on snowmelt to replenish waterways that supply drinking water. Communities out West, including in California, rely on an abundance of snowpack to ensure that reservoirs hold enough water to meet the needs of homes, industries, and wildlife. The study authors point out that, though air is cleaner overall, pollution from wildfire smoke is on the rise. The climate crisis has created conditions that worsen naturally occurring wildfires, which means more particles in the air from fires in our atmosphere. Canadian wildfires this summer created record-breaking air pollution that spread far across the continent. Thankfully, large wildfires are not as common during the winter in the Northern Hemisphere. “The uncertainties of wildfire simulations are expected to have only minor impacts on our results, as we focus on the snow season from December to May when wildfire activities are less frequent,” the team wrote. Modeling snowmelt is a highly complex effort, though. The shape of the individual snowflakes in the snowpack must also be considered, because the shape of the snow grains affects the overall rate of melting. The presence of algae on snow can also affect melting, but the study notes that more modeling and observation is needed to better understand how this could change snowmelt. “Most models have not looked at these two effects, warming and dirty snow, together when projecting future changes,” Ruby Leung, a scientist and study author, said in a press release. “It’s important to do so, because they can have opposite effects. Determining which one is the more dominant influence is a key to determining the fate of the snowpack in the future.” Want more climate and environment stories?

""Wildfires are a problem and they're dangerous,"" they say in their podcast from Chautauqua Elementary School, on Vashon Island. ""But there's ways to prevent them, so respect wildfire safety precautions and do your best to prevent these fires."" This entryfrom Roz Hinds, Jia Khurana and Sadie Pritsky was among more than 100 podcasts this year inNPR's Student Podcast Challengethat touched on a topic that's increasingly important to young people:climate change. Over and over again, student journalists tried making sense of extreme weather events that are becoming more common or more intense: flash floods, hurricanes, droughts, wildfires. Here are four student podcasts that offer a glimpse into the minds of students and what they have to say about climate-related news in their communities — and what they hope to do about it. Behind the Scenes of the Mosquito FireIn a 10-episode series, a sixth-grade class at the Georgetown School of Innovation in Georgetown, Calif., shares stories from the devastatingMosquitoFire in 2022. This group of eight students asks two firefighters from the Georgetown Fire Department what it's like to fight fires and protect loved ones in their hometown. Fires: Set AblazeAt Chautauqua Elementary, the Vashon fifth-graders talk about the far-reaching and lasting impact of wildfires and wildfire smoke — and the direct effects on their lives, like waiting for the school bus on a smoky day. The students also interview experts and share their research on wildfire precautions. Flowing Through Time: The Past, Present, and Future of WaterIn this podcast from Peak Academy, a group of eight middle schoolers reports on dealing with water shortages in Bozeman, Montana. They trace the history of their growing hometown's water supply, which has been dependent on mountain snowmelt. As that source becomes less reliable in a warming world, the students turn to the grown-ups to ask what they can do to conserve water.

While the death toll initially stood at seven, one of the injured died in the hospital overnight, state police said. The crash, involving at least 168 vehicles, occurred on Monday morning as heavy fog conditions severely lowered visibility, according to Louisiana State Police. A long stretch of Interstate 55, a 24-mile-long highway over Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans, is expected to be closed ""for the foreseeable future,"" police said. Interstate 10 and Interstate 310 were also closed as a result of the crash, police said. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards confirmed the accident in a statement Monday. For hours after the crash, emergency crews worked to clear debris from both northbound and southbound lanes, according to state police. A portion of the crash scene on I-55 caught on fire shortly after the initial incident, authorities said. A comprehensive structural inspection will take place once the bridge surface is completely clear of debris, diesel and other chemicals, police said. The super fog was caused by smoke from marsh fires burning in the region combined with dense fog developing in the area early Monday morning bringing extremely low visibility. In some spots, visibility was near zero, creating dangerous driving conditions. Super fogs typically form when condensed water vapor mixes with the smoke and moisture released from damp organic material smoldering from a nearby fire, such as brush, leaves and trees, according to theNational Weather Service. Visibility can be lowered to less than 10 feet as a result, according to the NWS. This has been occurring in the region over the past several mornings, with the location of the densest fog and most dangerous conditions varying day to day, forecasts show. Super fogs can be especially dangerous when they develop near and over highways. The localized nature of the weather phenomenon means that visibility conditions can worsen rapidly within a very short distance, which can lead to a hazardous combination of sudden low to near-zero visibility and vehicles traveling at a high speed on a highway. The very limited visibility then hinders a driver's ability to react to changing conditions on a roadway. The National Weather Service issued a dense fog advisory for much of southeastern Louisiana on Monday morning, including from Baton Rouge to New Orleans. Over the past several days, the National Weather Service has been warning of the threat of dense fog during the early mornings in the region that would be worsened in some areas by nearby marsh fires. State police advised drivers to use their low-beam headlights if they can't see at least 500 feet in front of them. The fog dissipated by mid Monday morning, and all fog alerts have since been canceled. Morning fog is not uncommon this time of the year for the region, but more than 86% of the state is currently battling extreme drought conditions, which is elevating fire danger. This could mean more instances of super fog in the coming days and weeks as cooler temperatures settle in, but the drought and wildfire risk persist. In addition, devastating drought and wildfire conditions continue to impact Louisiana. More than 60% of the state is now categorized at exceptional drought, the highest category of concern, according to theU.S. Drought Monitor. Just three months ago, 0% of the state was listed under exceptional drought. ""The combination of wildfire smoke and dense fog is dangerous, and I want to encourage all Louisianans in affected areas to take extreme caution when traveling,"" Edwards said in a statement. The St. John the Baptist Parish Sheriff's Office, which initially responded to the crash, directed media requests to Louisiana State Police."

Thick fog and smoke from multiple marsh fires mingled to reduce visibility for drivers commuting on Monday. Twenty-five people were injured in the crash on Interstate 55 in St John the Baptist Parish, said police, who warned the death toll could rise. Some vehicles caught fire and were abandoned, leaving a trail of burnt-out wreckage and mangled metal. The blaze broke out as one of the vehicles involved in the crash was a tanker truck carrying what police called a ""hazardous liquid"". One car was driven off the road and into the water, but the driver was safely rescued, police told WWL-TV. Officers said the motorway will remain closed until at least midday on Tuesday. ""A portion of the crash scene caught on fire shortly after the initial incident. One tanker truck carrying a hazardous liquid is being off-loaded due to a compromised tank/trailer,"" Lt Melissa Matey said in a statement. Mike Tregre, sheriff of St John the Baptist, said an estimated 100 people were stranded and school buses were being used to transport them to their destinations. Clarencia Patterson Reed, 46, who was driving to Hammond, told local media she was able to avoid hitting the car in front of her, but the vehicles behind her began slamming into her car. ""It was 'Boom. Boom.' All you kept hearing was crashing for at least 30 minutes,"" she said. She was able to get out of her car, but her wife was trapped inside and was injured. The National Weather Service (NWS) in New Orleans described the weather phenomenon as a ""super fog"", cautioning that similarly dangerous weather conditions could appear later this week. On its website, it states super fog can form when a mixture of smoke and moisture from damp, smouldering vegetation mixes with cooler air. The smoky conditions reduced visibility to less that 10ft (3m). The NWS said on Tuesday morning that heavy overnight winds had helped to disperse fog in some areas, but warned that dangerous driving conditions persisted in many areas. Governor John Bel Edwards offered his thoughts and prayers for those killed in the crash, and urged residents to donate blood at a local medical centre to ""help replenish supplies that are being drained today to care for the wounded"". Louisiana has battled blazing wildfires, heatwaves and relentless droughts over the course of the summer. Exceptional drought - the highest category tracked by the US Drought Monitor - is currently in place across 62% of the southern state."

""It was favorable conditions for firefighters"" but humidity remained low and rugged terrain made the work challenging for the approximately 1,200 firefighters, Roseen said. The size of the blaze remained unchanged at just under 4 square miles (10 square kilometers). One firefighter was injured but was in stable condition, Roseen said. He didn’t have details. Gusty, dry Santa Ana winds were blowing Monday when the fire erupted near rural Aguanga in Riverside County about 53 miles (85 kilometers) north of San Diego. Evacuation orders were issued for 4,000 residents as flames spread rapidly. With progress being made against the blaze, many evacuation orders were reduced to warnings on Wednesday, and several thousand people were allowed to return home but about 2,500 homes and other buildings remained threatened, authorities said. Although the forecast for the next few days was favorable, those allowed back home should remain vigilant, Roseen said. “There's always a chance to that winds could kick up,” he said. Seven homes and other buildings had been destroyed and six others damaged, authorities said. Retiree George Boyles told The Press-Enterprise that the fire seemed far away at first but suddenly was coming toward his home. He and his wife, Lucila, initially planned to drive out but instead had to ride out the firestorm in a cleared area of dirt on their property. Their house and garage were destroyed, said Boyles, adding they had paid off the property in April. Another resident, Luis Quinonez, was away when one of his two properties burned to the ground. No one was hurt, and his dogs, cats, chickens and roosters all survived, he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. The Santa Ana winds, which have a long history of stoking the region's wildfires, blow out of the interior toward the Pacific Coast. The dry air saps moisture from vegetation, making it easier to burn. Forecasters predicted a return of moist ocean air by Friday."

And the cuts could reduce staffing levels among the federal workforce, potentially imperiling one of the country's most significant lines of defense against wildfires, which have becomemore prevalentin recent years. Last year, federal wildland firefighters wereaffordedadditional pay through a short-term measure, with the heightened salaries seen as a way to retain and draw in workers. But federal officials are now saying that a wave of firefighters could leave their positions in search of better-paying roles if the pay increases are not made permanent, according to The Times. After President Joe Biden boosted the minimum wage for wildland firefighters from $13 an hour to $15 an hour, he has pushed for a permanent pay bump. Congress latersigned offon a pay raise of $20,000 a year, or 50% of a base salary for federal firefighters. Per the US Department of Agriculture, the entry-level salary for a federal wildland firefighter is roughly $34,000, absent the temporary pay increase. But the legislative fix was only temporary, and Bidenpushedfor the permanent pay when he submitted his administration's 2024 budget earlier this year. Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado has been one of the most prominent supports of the increased firefighter pay on Capitol Hill. But with the threat of a showdown looming, coupled with the fact that the House still doesn't have a speaker after Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California wasoustedfrom the role last week, time is running out for a permanent solution. With the risk of wildfires becoming a growing environmental and economic threat across the country, but especially in Interior West states like Colorado, the threat of an exodus of firefighters has many worried. The National Federation of Federal Employees recently said that ""30 percent to 50 percent of the workforce"" could leave their positions if the pay increases are no longer in effect. ""As a result, this country will be unable to respond to megafires and other emergencies because Congress failed to come to an agreement to appropriately pay the folks who risk their lives to defend us from wildfires,"" the federationsaidin a statement. Neguse hasintroducedlegislation that would permanently boost federal firefighter pay, but it has so far not advanced in the House. ""I'm deeply concerned about the inability of Congress to muster the political will to get this done,"" the congressman told The Times. ""The reality is that our wild-land firefighters are woefully undercompensated."""

Weather can have a huge impact on the successful operation and bottom line of family entertainment centers. With hotter summers and more extreme weather, planning is key to profitability. Excessive heat, torrential rain, snowstorms, wildfires resulting in poor air quality—the list goes on, as does the need for planning and preparation. As an Eagle Scout, my motto is “Be prepared,” and as the operator of multiple family entertainment centers (FECs), my team and I practice planning and preparation. This experience has shown me that being proactive impacts safety, staffing and sales. Here's what FECs need to keep in mind. Be nimble when the weather changes. Many FEC operators look at bad weather and decide to close for the day instead of finding the silver lining in every cloud. FECs in Florida, for example, know that a passing rain shower is no big deal, so most folks go about their business. But in dry areas of California, inclement weather can paralyze those unfamiliar with driving in the rain. Monitor weather conditions, and be nimble. In my experience, most operators don’t cut staff quickly enough when bad weather is in the forecast for their area. When you see cancellations, cut staff and hours immediately. But before shutting down completely, look first at how you can leverage the weather to your advantage. For example, chilly evenings are an opportunity to promote hot toddies by the fire pit or savoring drinks under the stars warmed by a cozy patio heater. Excessive heat is an invitation to come inside and enjoy icy, cool air conditioning in the arcade. Rainy days at home with the kids are no fun; get them out of the house and actively gaming in the arcade while you sip a beverage and supervise—everyone wins. Any opportunity to position your FEC as a respite from the weather should be maximized to generate revenues. If you are not prepared, you will lose sales. Develop advertising and social media messaging templates in advance so you can quickly react to changing weather situations. Prioritize safety and comfort for guests and staff. For FECS with an outdoor component such as miniature golf, kiddie rides, batting cages, go-karts or laser tag, begin by reviewing your assets. How can you deal with extreme heat? Shade trees are an option but require time to mature. Awnings, sunshades, umbrellas and shade sails can help cool areas on a permanent or semi-permanent basis, while an outdoor misting system or portable misters can help to keep guests and employees comfortable. Hydration stations stocked with cold drinks, along with a gift shop carrying personal fans, sunglasses, hats, umbrellas and sunscreen, are additional revenue streams. Guests won’t stay if they're too hot, so keep them cool. Make sure your team members are properly hydrated and safe in excessive heat as well. Rotational shifts, extra water and cooling breaks, wick-away garments, reflective gear and lightweight uniforms can make a big difference in safety, comfort and performance. Inclement weather might require rain gear, while cold weather calls for heaters, windbreakers, jackets, heavier uniforms and proper footwear. Some of this branded gear can also be sold in your gift shop as fan swag and souvenirs. Wildfires and poor air quality present both challenges and opportunities. When the air quality is bad, make sure your team members are safe and close unless your FEC has a big enough indoor component such as laser tag, video gaming or an arcade. These assets can be leveraged to offer comfortable indoor fun in a climate-controlled environment, so employ your pre-developed sales strategies and templates to advertise and promote an attractive and fun alternative on social media in real time. The bottom line: Have a plan for any weather. For clear skies and smooth sailing in any weather, have a plan and a program in place. Develop strategies and tactics for everything from a sprinkle to a downpour, as well as plans for lightning, hurricanes and named storms that require securing anything that could float or blow away. Be proactive, monitor weather conditions and be ready to act quickly. Being prepared just might make you more profitable.

That's a welcome boon to a state that has spent much of the past dozen years in a deep drought, forcing state leaders to grapple with how the state should share and manage its water in the future. A series of winter storms in early 2023 busted the state's most recent dry spell. State officials measured 33.56 inches (85.2 centimeters) of precipitation through the end of September. California's “water year” begins annually on Oct. 1 so it can include all of the fall and winter months when California gets the bulk of its rain and snow. The state depends on those wet months to fill its reservoirs that supply water for drinking, farming and environmental uses throughout the state. Those reservoirs dipped to dangerously low levels in in recent years because of an extreme drought. That prompted water restrictions on homes and businesses and curtailed deliveries to farmers. It also threatened already endangered species of fish, including salmon, that need cold water in the rivers to survive. Statewide, reservoirs held 27.4 million acre feet of stored water as September ended. One acre foot of water is enough to supply two families of four for a year. Of that, about 4.5 million acre feet are held in the State Water Project, a network of 30 reservoirs and storage facilities that provides water to 27 million people. “This was as close to a miracle year as you can get,” said Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources. The reservoirs were helped by a series of nine strong storms that hit California over the winter. Those storms carried so much rain and snow they were known as “atmospheric rivers.” They caused widespread flooding throughout the state and were blamed for multiple deaths. The storms also dumped tons of snow on the mountains. The state snowpack on April 1 was 237% above its historical average. It's just the fourth time since 1950 the state's snowpack exceeded 200% of average, according to Michael Anderson, the state's climatologist. All of that snow melted in the spring and summer, filling rushing rivers and reservoirs. Water levels at Lake Oroville rose 240 feet (73 meters) between Dec. 1, 2022, and the end of the snowmelt period. That's the largest increase in storage in one season since the reservoir opened in 1968, according to Ted Craddock, deputy director for the State Water Project. State and federal officials will have to drain some of the reservoirs to make room for more water that's expected to come this year. The state's rainy season could be complicated by El Nino — the natural, temporary and occasional warming of part of the Pacific Ocean. El Nino affects weather patterns around the world. California typically gets more rain and snow during El Nino year. This year’s El Nino has a 56% chance to be considered strong and a 25% chance to reach supersized levels, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The potential for more strong storms this year, particularly along the coast, “keeps me awake a little bit at night,” said Gary Lippner, deputy director for flood management and dam safety with the California Department of Water Resources. “We just do not have extensive flood systems on the coast of California,” he said. “That's an area we're paying particularly attention to.” All of the rain and snow this year could have played a part in what has so far been a smaller wildfire season. Wildfires exploded in size during the drought in part because of the super dry conditions. So far this year, just over 476 square miles (1,234 square kilometers) have burned in California. That's well below the five year average of 2,031 square miles (5,260 square kilometers), according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. ___ This story has been updated to correct the amount of acre feet of storage the reservoirs in the State Water Project finished the year with.

The state's home insurance market is reeling after disasters like this one. MIAMI — Many in Florida are findinghomeowners' insurance unaffordable, and it's only getting worse. Gregg Weiss lives in an older neighborhood in West Palm Beach. His home and many others are nearly a century old. It's a great place to live he says, except when it comes to buying homeowners insurance. Two years ago, he was shocked at a notice he received from his insurance company. ""The windstorm portion of our insurance went from about $10,000 a year which is not cheap,"" he says. ""But it doubled and went up to $20,000."" He called his insurance agent and got some surprising advice. ""She said honestly, my recommendation is: pay off your mortgage and self-insure yourself."" Weiss, who's currently serving asPalm Beach County's mayor, says he and his wife took her advice. They paid off their mortgage and dropped their insurance. And he knows others who are doing the same. But for homeowners in Florida who have mortgages and are required to carry insurance, there's little recourse except to cover the steep increases. There are reports that because of the high insurance costs, some are beingforced to leave the state. In many places, including California, Colorado and Louisiana, there's been a steep rise in the cost of homeowners' insurance. But it's particularly staggering in Florida, a state that already has the highest insurance costs in the nation. Many Floridians have seen insurance premiums go up by more than 40% this year. And despite efforts by lawmakers to stabilize the market, costs are likely to keep rising. Officials have heard the complaints. After a recent hearing at the state Capitol in Tallahassee,Florida's insurance commissioner, Michael Yaworsky, said, ""Everyone is in this together. It is a very difficult time for Florida homeowners."" The cost of homeowners' insurance in Florida is more than three-and-a-half times the national average. There are lots of reasons — among them, the three hurricanes that battered the state in the last two years. But policymakers and the insurance industry say excessive litigation has played a major role in driving up prices. Yaworsky says reforms passed by lawmakers last year and signed by the governor have begun to limit lawsuits. ""After years of trying to get it done,"" he says, ""the governor and others finally pushed it through. And it should improve the situation over time."" Butstate Sen. Geraldine Thompsonsays nearly a year after the bill was signed, homeowners in her Orlando district are still waiting. ""We find now the litigation has gone down,"" she says. ""It has dropped. But the premiums have not dropped."" Another inexorable factordriving up insurance costs is climate change. Sophisticated modeling by bigreinsurance companieshas led the industry to take a hard look at the risk in places like Florida, which is struggling with sea level rise as well as more dangerous storms.Benjamin Keys, a professor of real estate at the University of Pennsylvania, says, ""What we have is a real changing landscape in insurance markets, a recognition that risks have increased in recent years. Disasters are occurring with more frequency and severity than previously forecast.""

Nearly a thousand homes were destroyed, making it the most destructive wildfire in Colorado history. The rising cost of construction — up nearly 40% over the last five years — is also driving up premiums. In Florida's challenging market, seven insurance companies became insolvent over the last year. But, following the recent legal reforms, Mark Friedlander with theInsurance Information Institutebelieves the market may be stabilizing. ""Companies that were not writing business are opening up again and starting to write risk. And companies are starting to see some positive light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said. Five new insurance companies have been approved to begin writing policies in Florida. Even so, Friedlander says,homeowners shouldn't look for relief anytime soon. It's a similar outlookin California,Louisianaand many other states seeing double-digit increases in the cost of insurance. Real estate professor Benjamin Keys says if private insurers keep backing away from what they see as high-risk markets, the federal government may be asked to step in. ""Will we see a national wind insurance program? Will we see a national wildfire insurance program?"" He says, ""I think that those are possibilities."" There is a precedent. More than 50 years ago, because private insurance wasn't available, the federal government created theNational Flood Insurance Program."

The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Over the past 10 years, insurance premiums have changed dramatically. The prediction back then was that the California wildfires would spread to Colorado, and that'salready started to happen. Two years ago, a really bad wildfire came very close to Aspen, and that triggered premiums to go up tremendously. Now, I've seen premiums go up at least three times. In the past, you were able to insure a $5 million home for $7,000 per year. Now that's $35,000, $40,000. Insurance is still available,unlike some places like Florida, but you have fewer options. One of my clients had a $6,500 policy on a multimillion-dollar home in Aspen. He'd been renovating it for the past year and a half and when he was done, his premium was $35,000. He was like, ""What do you mean? I know there's an increase but it shouldn't be that high."" I showed him the responses from all of the companies. Most didn't even want to insure it at all because they already have too much business here. They don't want to add more houses. He was from Florida, so he's seen that movie before. His shock was like ""It's also happening here? Why here?"" Every house in Aspen is vulnerable. Many of the houses are far from a fire station. The insurers worry that by the time the fire truck has arrived, the house will already be gone. And that's a $20 million hit for insurers. Take the average house in Aspen: You have $5 million for the house, $3 million for the contents, another $2 million for loss of rents. You have another $1 million for landscaping. The exposure is very high. Wildfires have no mercy. In the past, you have actuary and insurance companies predict what an insurance company's going to pay in the next five years and, based on that, they come up with a rate. They used to predict pretty accurately what was going to happen.Predictions have not been as good as they should be in the last few years. Everything has been a surprise. They're in panic mode. Reinsurance costs have gone up tremendously.All these insurance companies have to buy from reinsurance companies and there's only three or four main ones in the world. When reinsurers say, ""Well, this year costs are going up 60%,"" what happens is the insurers have to pass that on to the policyholders. Now policyholders have an increase in their premiums because the reinsurers are experiencing disasters all around the world. It's not sustainable to just charge Northern California, where there's increased risk. The reinsurer basically spreads the risk. Everybody will end up paying for it. Right now, the increases are just reaching homeowners with the highest limits of tolerance. When you buy a $5 million house or a $10 million house, paying $30,000 or $20,000 a year is not going to make a difference."

Humans are driving climate change. And that means we humans can change our trajectory. While governments and businesses have a key role to play in reducing planet-heating emissions, individual actions matter, too. Many solutions can feel overwhelming, or far beyond what one person can tackle (on top of the everyday challenges of life). Across the NPR Network we've been reporting on individual actions that can make a positive impact and what you need to do to get started. We've gathered a bunch here. Some require a little planning (think major home appliance replacement), while others might mean one less thing on your weekend to do (like skipping raking your leaves this fall). Some are suited for homeowners, others are doable if you're renting, and others still are general guidance for any stage of life. We've broken them down by indoor, outdoor and on-the-go actions to help you find what's right for you at this moment. INDOOR—OUTDOOR—ON THE GO Heat pumps can work for both heatingandcooling. You can think of a heat pump as an air conditioner that can also work backward.Julia Simon/NPRhide caption Heat pumps can work for both heatingandcooling. You can think of a heat pump as an air conditioner that can also work backward. If you've got AC, make sure you're using it right.Engineers saymost air conditioner systems are only designed to keep indoor temperatures about 20 degrees coolerthan outdoors. So the hotter the air, the more effort your unit is putting in to bring the temperature down and the more power it's consuming.Here are five ways to make sure you are getting the most out of your unit. Upgrade your gas furnace to a heat pump.Heat pumps both heatandcool your home, while reducing gas usage in your home and the risk for methane leaks. While they can help you cut down on energy costs, switching to a heat pump is a major investment. Make sure to check and see if there are any local rebates (likethis one for Washington residentsorthese incentives in California) you could be eligible for if you start to budget for one.There are also federal credits of up to $2,000for efficient heat pumps that could help with the investment. Renters might also be able to get credits. Keep your home safe from smoke.As smoke reaches new areas of North America, you may be wondering how to keep your air safe during wildfire season.Parts of the country that have been navigating wildfires for generations have some tips to share. Switch to electric cooking.Not only is gas-powered cooking releasing harmful chemicals into the environment, butit could be contributing to health problemsfor you if you're cooking indoors. Plus, research has shown gas stoves can leak pollutantseven when they're off. If replacing your stove seems out of reach, check to see whether your area might offer assistance to bring down the cost (Sacramento wants all gas appliances out by 2045) orswitch at least part time to an electric hot plate. There aresolutions gas stove makers could take toward reducing the risk — here's how.Plus,all your gas and induction stove questions, answered. Stay cool without an air conditioner.In many parts of the country central air is not common, especially in residential buildings. As climate change causes temperatures in many areas to rise, staying cool has required some creative solutions.Here are six life hacks from India on how to stay comfortable and safe even when temperatures rise. Save money on your utilities.Isn't it great when you can save money while helping the environment? For example, in Los Angeles the Department of Water and Power will help youcover the cost of adding a water-monitoring system to your homeso you can track usage by the hour vs. the bimonthly breakdown you get on your bill. Eat more sustainably.While it does depend on where you are and what's locally available, there are some general guidelines you can follow with the planet in mind when it comes to eating.First, be mindful of your meat.Cows create a lot of methane (a significant driver of global climate change). As WBUR reported: One study found swapping out beef with almost anything else for one meal a day cancut a person's dietary carbon footprint by 48%. Then, address your food waste. Cut down on what you throw away (wilted basil can become pesto; scraps can become compost). And watch out for single-use items like coffee pods thatgenerate greenhouse gases to produce the individual-serving packaging. Looking for more on sustainable eating?WBUR has a whole newsletter about it. Fix what you have instead of replacing it.Shoes, clothes, furniture and even some electronics can be repaired to extend their life and keep waste out of landfills.WUWM has a roundup of businesses that can help in the Milwaukee areaand can serve as inspiration to find resources in your community. And whenever possible,consider purchasing secondhand itemswhen it's in your budget to do so.

Don't bag your leaves.First, it keeps almost 8 million tons of leaves out of landfills. Second, it will helpkeep your grass healthy.The time it gives you back this fall is an added bonus! Make use of your yard. In parts of the country where water usage is a top concern, you can get paid to replace your lawn with native plants or shrubs (like this program in Utah). Ifyou're attached to the look, set your mower blade higher and leave the clippings where they are to help fertilize your grass. If you're in the mood for a change, add an edible garden orplants native to your regionthat will require less care. Some, like clover, help balance the soil and pull nitrogen out of the air. Where available, learning fromthe regenerative practices used by Indigenous communitiescan be a great start. At the end of the season,saving seedscan both save you money and helppreserve varietiesin the face of a changing climate. Plant for pollinators.Selecting plants that support local pollinators can be a quick action that can have a big impact.Here's a list of plants you can add to your garden, or even a window box or container that will help. This Kansas backyard gardener is even trying to turn her harvestinto a second income. Loading... Where you can, plant trees.Trees can help control temperaturesandimprove air qualityandthe health of your yard.Just make sure the plants you're adding are approved for your area. Local wildlife organizations or cooperative exchanges often have lists of plants with neutral or positive impacts on the local flora and fauna, likethis list from Idaho's Fish & Game. Leverage your roof.Earlier this summer, the fire that devastated historic Lahaina in western Maui left a red-roofed house relatively unscathed. The owner credited the house's miraculous survival, in part,to the specially designed metal roofadded during a recent renovation. If cutting down cooling costs is a top concern in your area,research suggests painting your roof whitecould be a cost-effective way to reduce summer heat. And depending on your sun exposure, rooftop solar could be a long-term investment to lower energy costs and reduce your home's reliance on nonrenewable energy. Make sure to check local rebates and incentives that could lower the upfront costs. Here's a breakdown of the costs to help you budget if you're in theMountain West, plus a closer look atcommunity solar efforts in Californiafor areas where rooftop solar is out of reach. Weigh the impact of your final resting place.Whilenatural or green burials(which can cut down on the carbon and energy used to prepare a body for burial) have been a thing forever, and are the custom in Jewish and Muslim burials, the process isnew for a lot of cemeteries in the U.S. An electric bicycle stands parked in the streets of Manhattan on Nov. 15, 2022, in New York City.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide caption An electric bicycle stands parked in the streets of Manhattan on Nov. 15, 2022, in New York City.

And with thehigh cost of living pushing some to move farther from work, commuting can be a big factor in our individual impact on the environment.One solution being adopted by some commuters is electric bicycles. Colorado is already offering a statewide e-bike rebateto help lower the upfront investment costs, andplaces like Washington, D.C., andWashington state are weighing similar rebates for residents.

The days are growing shorter, the temperature cooler, and the leaves are changing color.The delayed onset of autumn in 2023 is not a one off. It's actually part of a broader trend in which the shift from summer to winter is happening later in the year. Myown researchthat I've carried out over the past 13 years points towardsclimate changeas the likely culprit.One of the most noticeable effects ofclimatechange is the changing patterns of vegetation seasonality around us. This includes the timing of important biological events such as bud burst, the appearance of the first leaves, flowering and leaf fall.In general, the appearance of the first leaf marks the arrival ofspring, while leaf fall signals the beginning of autumn. The timing of these events is changing, particularly in thenorthern hemisphere, where spring appears to be starting earlier and autumn's onset is being delayed.Traditionally, monitoring vegetation seasonality involved meticulously documenting these seasonal events year after year. The earliest records of spring events in the UK date back to 1736, when naturalistRobert Marshambegan recording the timing of spring events in Norwich, England.Today,satellite datahas become an essential tool for tracking changes in vegetation seasonality. This data can be used to estimate vegetation vigor (an indicator of vegetation's condition, strength and lushness). Changes can then be used to identify the start and end of each growingseason.Longer growing seasonsClimate researchers now have nearly five decades of satellite observations at their disposal. Analysis of this data reveals that spring has advanced by approximately 15 days, while autumn has been delayed by a similar amount. The overall outcome has been the extension of the growing season by an entire month over the past three decades.The shift in the timing of the seasons is particularly pronounced at higher latitudes. Vegetation situated more than 55° north of the equator, such as in the larch forests of northern Russia, has shown a trend towards an extended growing season, increasing by up to one day per year.A longer growing season is not necessarily a bad thing. It means a longer period of photosynthesis, which theoretically could boostnet carbon uptake—although there isno concrete evidencefor this yet.But an earlier onset of the growing season exposes plants to the risk of damage from spring frosts and an increased vulnerability to summer drought.Researchhas found that anearly springin central and northern Europe in 2018 promoted increased vegetation growth. This, in turn, contributed to soil losing its moisture quickly, amplifying summer drought conditions.Role of climate changeTemperature isone of the primary factorsinfluencing vegetation growth at high northerly latitudes. So, an earlier onset of spring and a later arrival of autumn are probably driven by the risingglobal mean temperature. Since 1981, the global mean temperature has increased by0.18°C per decade.Nonetheless, the influence of temperature on the duration of the growing season may change depending on the type of vegetation. In ecosystems primarily dominated by forests, awarmer climatecan lead tomore photosynthesis and increased vegetation productivity.On the other hand, in a warmer climate, more water evaporates from the Earth's surface, drying out the soil. This could adversely affect the growth of plants with shallow roots, such as grasses andherbaceous plants.Another consequence of climate change is the increased frequency of droughts during the peak of the growing season. Drought conditions result in severe water stress for plants, leading to the premature shedding of leaves or a change in their color, a phenomenon often referred to as a ""false autumn"".The UKexperienced such conditionsin August 2022, when there was an early leaf fall and the browning of leaves, as the country grappled with anextreme heat wave.A longer and drier growing season can also increase the risk of forest fires. AUS studyfrom 2006 revealed a significant surge in wildfire activity within the forests of the northern Rockies from the mid-1980s. This change was closely linked to increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt.Climate change is having a clear impact on vegetation growth and seasonality. But the extent and severity of its impact varies depending on the type of plant and where it grows.The availability of satellite data spanning the past 50 years is a valuable resource for capturing changes in the duration of the vegetation growing season. This data is helping scientists quantify the scale and consequences of these changes, providing insights into how plants are responding to our warming climate."

Credit: Credit: FEMA/Michael Mancino, Public Domain.""Life on our planet is clearly under siege,"" Ripple said. ""The statistical trends show deeply alarming patterns of climate-related variables and disasters. We also found little progress to report as far as humanity combating climate change.""Among the key numbers in the report:Fossil fuel subsidies—actions by governments that artificially lower the cost of energy production, raise the price received by producers or lower the price paid by consumers—roughly doubled between 2021 and 2022, from $531 billion to just over $1 trillion.Already this year wildfires in Canada have pumped more than 1 gigaton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, greater than Canada's total 2021greenhouse gas emissionsof 0.67 gigatons.In 2023, there have already been 38 days with global average temperatures more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Until this year, such days were a rarity, the authors note.The highest average Earth surface temperature ever recorded came this past July, and there's reason to believe it was the highest surface temperature the planet has seen in the last 100,000 years.""As scientists, we are hugely troubled by the sudden increases in the frequency and severity of climate-related disasters,"" said Wolf, now a scientist with Corvallis-based Terrestrial Ecosystems Research Associates.""The frequency and severity of those disasters might be outpacing rising temperatures. By the end of the 21st century, as many as 3–6 billion people may find themselves outside the Earth's livable regions, meaning they will be encountering severe heat, limited food availability and elevated mortality rates.""The authors say policies are needed that take aim at the underlying issue of ""ecological overshoot."" When human demand on the Earth's resources is too large, the result in an array of environmental crises, including biodiversity decline. As long as humanity continues to putextreme pressureon the planet, any strategy that focuses only on carbon or climate will simply redistribute the pressure, they note.""Our goal is to communicate climate facts and makepolicy recommendations,"" Ripple said. ""It is a moral duty of scientists and our institutions to alert humanity of any potential existential threat and to show leadership in taking action.""The authors urge transitioning to a global economy that prioritizes human well-being and curtails overconsumption and excessive emissions by the rich. Specific recommendations include phasing outfossil fuel subsidies, transitioning toward plant-based diets, scaling up forest protection efforts and adopting international coal elimination and fossil fuel non-proliferation treaties.They stress that all climate-related actions must be grounded in equity andsocial justice, noting thatextreme weatherand other climate impacts are being disproportionately felt by thepoorest people, who have contributed the least toclimate change."

Mililani and Wahiawa are the towns closest to the flames, but they weren't at risk. Army installations Schofield Barracks and Wheeler Army Airfield are also in the area, which is about about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Honolulu. Video footage shot by the state Department of Land and Natural Resources showed white and brown smoke rising from green forests. Black and grey patches covered already scorched hillsides. Firefighters battled flames from the air because the terrain is rough and inaccessible. The fire was moving east on a ridge and was 30% contained by midafternoon Tuesday, the Honolulu Fire Department said in a news release. The fire burned through heavy timber and native vegetation, the state said. Hawaii's tropical forests evolved without experiencing frequent fires and flames aren't a part of their natural life cycle. Invasive plants often grow on burned lands, which increases the risk of future wildfires, according to a 2013 state action plan for koa forests. The report said climate change was expected to worsen Hawaii's wildfire problem. Oahu is currently going through a dry spell even though the winter rainy season began in October. The U.S. Drought Monitor said Central Oahu was in moderate drought as of last week. In August, multiple wildfires erupted on Maui including a blaze that killed at least 99 people and destroyed more than 2,000 structures in Lahaina. Powerful winds related to ahurricanepassing far to Hawaii’s south helped fuel that fire and prevented firefighters from using helicopters to tackle the flames."

National security is no exception. TheNational Intelligence Council has foundthat ""climate change will increasingly exacerbate risks to U.S. national security interests as the physical impacts increase and geopolitical tensions mount about how to respond to the challenge.""The U.S. Defense Department recognizes that climate change is a ""threat multiplier"" as it exacerbates existing environmental stresses andsecurity risks. In a2021 Department of Defensereport, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that almost everything the U.S. Defense Department (DOD) does to defend the American people is jeopardized by climate change—the department's strategies, plans, capabilities, missions, and equipment—and the risks are growing, especially since the world is not on track to meet its Paris Agreement goals. The risks lie not only within U.S. borders; our partner countries impacted by climate change affect American national security interests as well, he said.Jason Bordoff, director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, goes further. ""DOD and the wider national security community need to broaden their definition of 'climate risk,'"" he said. ""There's been plenty of analysis conducted on the exposure and risk to military infrastructure from rising sea level, storms, etc., but there will also be less direct impacts of climate change, such as competition over critical minerals or political instability in resource-rich nations as fossil fuel use eventually dwindles.""Here is a look at the national security challenges posed by climate change.Direct threatsInfrastructureSea-level rise andextreme weatherare affecting both the military's infrastructure and its supply chains. Installations and facilities near coasts are eroding and flooding.In 2013, Fort Irwin in California experienced flash flooding that cost over $65 million in damages. In Virginia, the Norfolk Naval Station, the world's largest naval base, experiences routine flooding during rainstorms and high tides. This impacts the Navy's ability to conduct operations in the Atlantic Ocean, and hampers its work on ships and submarines in the shipyard. U.S.military baseson Guam and the Marshall Islands are also vulnerable tosea-level rise. Damage from 2018's Hurricane Michael shut down Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida for months; rebuilding it was estimated to cost $3.6 billion. Rising temperatures and extreme precipitation at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri can prevent stealth nuclear bombers from taking off.Global supply chains are also disrupted by extreme weather, which may hinder the military's ability to access critical supplies. Technology sectors such as artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, and semiconductors are essential to U.S. national security. But in 2021, severe flooding in Malaysia, a major hub for semiconductor assembly and packaging, disrupted the supply chain, contributing to a global semiconductor shortage.Extreme weather makes outdoor training and military exercises difficult and can affect the maintenance and effectiveness of weapons systems and other equipment. This means existing and new equipment will need to be redesigned to enable it to operate in all climate conditions. Weather conditions can also limit the amount of land available for training and reduce water supplies. Heat waves and other extreme weather can decrease personnel productivity and impact military members' health.Demand for military resourcesThe physical impacts of climate change increase the frequency, scale, and complexity of defense operations and make them more costly.Because natural disasters are increasing, the military is being called on more frequently as first responders for disaster and humanitarian relief and must respond to situations beyond their usual scope. For example, between 2016 and 2021, the number of National Guard personnel days spent fighting wildfires increased by 162,000 as droughts have lengthened fire seasons. During Hurricane Sandy, the DOD helped distribute 6.2 million meals, 7.8 million gallons of fuel, medical supplies, and other staples.Indirect threatsDisplacement and civil unrestClimate change also affects food and water security, degrades the environment, increases the spread of diseases, and disrupts essential services like electricity production. These impacts can drive migration. One study found that if we continue our fossil fuel use trajectory, the probability of multiple simultaneous droughts could increase from the late 20th century average by 40 percent by 2050 and 60 percent by late century.These droughts could potentially affect 120 million people around the world, triggering crop failures, threatening water supplies, and forcing people to migrate. The World Bank has warned that 143 million people particularly in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America could end up migrating due to climate impacts.As migrants enter countries or regions unprepared to deal with them, tensions rise. As we already see on the U.S. southern border, migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Venezuela, and other nations fleeing poverty, violence, and extreme weather are causing enormous political turmoil.Climate impacts contribute to poverty, social inequality, political instability, and violence. Weak governments have trouble meeting their people's basic needs, so civil unrest increases. These conditions can lead to shifts in the regional balance of power or result in the failure of states. In some of these cases, the U.S. military may be called upon to come to the aid of its partners to restore stability.Joshua Fisher, director of the Advanced Consortium on Cooperation, Conflict, and Complexity at Columbia Climate School, said that most of the conflicts he sees in the world are not directly driven by climate change.""What climate change is doing is impacting already vulnerable societies,"" he said. ""So if there are tensions, if there are large sectors of the population who are marginalized, by and large those same sectors of society are going to be impacted disproportionately by climate change. This opens up a mechanism where climate change can further marginalize and harm already vulnerable people. And that can be the mechanism that leads to increased conflict.""Conflicts around decarbonizationAccording to aNational Intelligence Council report, tensions are also likely to grow as countries argue about how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Paris Agreement goals. The conflict will be about which countries bear more responsibility to act and to pay, due to their historic emissions.""As pressure to decarbonize increases, you can expect more animosity between the developed and developing worlds as poorer countries wonder, rightly so, why the richer countries, who have created the climate crisis in the first place, are now asking them to limit their consumption of fossil fuels,"" said Bordoff.Developing countries will continue to demand more money from developed countries, which have failed to mobilize the promised $100 billion a year by 2020. The UN estimates that developing countries will need at least $300 billion per year by 2030 just for adaptation. Meanwhile, countries that rely on fossil fuels to support their economies see theenergy transitionas a threat and are attempting to slow progress towards decarbonization.""The pressure of the energy transition may, if not managed carefully, increase geopolitical tensions, creating new risks to energy security,"" said Bordoff. ""Many of these tensions will be seen in who is wielding influence in the emerging clean energy economy, and who the winners and losers are in a shrinking fossil fuel economy.""Competition for resourcesEfforts to achieve decarbonization will hasten the race to secure resources. For instance, as countries try to reduce their own vulnerability by becoming greener and more energy self-sufficient, the demand for rare minerals for batteries and solar panels will increase. According to Bordoff, to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, the demand for critical minerals will go up sixfold. Competition between countries to acquire and process the minerals needed for renewable energy technologies could result in conflict.""One example of this is a recent rift in the U.S.-E.U. relationship, where we've seen historical allies at odds over perceived unfair protectionism in new clean energy investments,"" said Bordoff. ""Another is the heightened tensions between China and the West with regards to critical minerals, batteries, orsolar panels, with Western leaders concerned about China's dominance over the production of clean energy and the potential weaponization of this market dominance. The longer the world takes to get to net zero, the worse these problems will get.""The ArcticThe melting Arctic ice is opening up the Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.This could lead tocompetitionfor sea lanes for commercial shipping between the United States, Russia, China, and Canada. Countries are also vying for the region's unclaimed land, fish, natural gas, minerals, and other resources.Most legal matters in the region are determined by the Arctic Council, which is made up of the United States, Russia, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. Other countries, such as China, Germany, and India, are considered observer countries. Because the Arctic Council's resolutions are nonbinding, however, it has no enforcement power. Consequently, as military and commercial activity in the region grows, so too could the risk of miscalculation and conflict.GeoengineeringThe U.S. intelligence community is alsoincreasingly concernedabout geoengineering, which is now being discussed more often as a viable option for dealing with climate change. This is particularly the case with solar geoengineering, which involves sending reflective sulfur dioxide particles into the atmosphere to reflect solar radiation away from Earth and imitate the cooling effect of a volcanic eruption.Research on geoengineering is being done around the world, particularly in the United States, China, and India. As there is currently no international governance for geoengineering, it's conceivable that in the future, a single country suffering from climate impacts could decide to conduct geoengineering on its own. This could cause weather patterns around the world to shift, disrupt monsoons, degrade the ozone layer, or trigger droughts that affect agriculture; it could also be weaponized. This could exacerbate tensions between countries or even lead to war.What the military is doingIt is now DOD policy to consider climate change in all its operations, activities, business processes, decision making, and resource allocation to ensure that military forces continue to be capable and effective.The DOD isinvesting $3.6 billionto enhance the resilience of its infrastructure, improve its energy and water capacities, and modernize its operations.This includes funding for microgrids, energy storage, and renewable energy, electric vehicles, and charging installations. $106 million will be used to improve the energy efficiency of operations. $1.3 billion will be invested into research and development in cutting-edge technology and prototypes of new conveyances. $54 million will go toward incorporating climate impacts into war games and exercises to ensure that the military can operate in all conditions.""In a warming climate, you're going to see rising seas threaten critical infrastructure, growing geopolitical tensions, larger flows of migration away from the most climate-vulnerable nations, civil conflict driven by resource scarcity, and new venues for conflict,"" said Bordoff. ""Each one of these by themselves would be worrying, but having them play out simultaneously will cause not only a drain on limited resources to counteract them, but will exacerbate today's worsening geopolitical trends.""He added, ""Military leaders need to devote more attention to some of these more complex consequences of climate change so that they can better prepare for them.""The DOD is one of the only organizations in the world with the ability to move materials anywhere around the world in 24 hours, according to Fisher. ""And so understanding the national security interest we have in preventing conflicts from escalating into outright violence should be one of the DOD's priorities,"" he said.The DOD should look at areas that are vulnerable toclimatechange, as well as at near- and mid-term forecasts for risks in various regions. ""They should utilize the resources they have to prevent conflict, not with military action, but rather by supporting rule of law programs or emergency support, or providing provisions, to try to prevent conflicts from escalating.""Fisher has been impressed with the DOD's handling of the topic ofclimate change. ""The DOD has been able to be frank and sober about it, but understand that it is anational securitythreat, and treat it as such, rather than getting mired in the politics of it,"" he said. ""The more they can maintain that focus, the better I think they'll be.""Provided by State of the PlanetThis story is republished courtesy of Earth Institute, Columbia Universityhttp://blogs.ei.columbia.edu.Citation: Why climate change is a national security risk (2023, October 11) retrieved 3 November 2023 "

Life, in this case, … [+7262 chars]",Psychology,"“Life’s callin’ again,” Kelsey Grammer croons in the updated version of “Tossed Salads and Scrambled Eggs” that plays over each episode’s closing credits in Paramount+’sFrasierrevival.Life, in this case, must be short fortelevision executives thirsty for a nostalgia-driven hit, because it’s hard to believe anyone else was clamoring for more of an 11-season sitcom that was itself aCheersspin-off. When you figure in the absence of virtually every original cast member besides Grammer, as well as new leadership behind the scenes, writer-showrunners Chris Harris (How I Met Your Mother) and Joe Cristalli (Life in Pieces), the project starts to sound especially dire. And it is. Premiering Oct. 12,Frasier2.0 picks up about two decades after its predecessor’s 2004 finale—an episode that found Seattle’s favorite pretentious radio shrink at a crossroads, as his widower father remarried, his brother and employee-turned-sister-in-law had a baby, and Frasier decided to forsake a job opportunity in San Francisco for a chance at love withLaura Linney’s Charlotte, who lived in Chicago. In the first few minutes of the revival we learn that he’s been there ever since, amassing fame and fortune as the Windy City’s favorite pretentious TV shrink. But now the show and the relationship are over. His parting words to the network: “Get off your knees, stop begging, I’m already out the door.” Charlotte, meanwhile, “told me the same thing.” Now, in the wake of his dad Martin’s funeral (John Mahoney, who played the elder Crane, died in 2018), he’s in his former home city of Boston for what is supposed to be a quick visit. Apparently he no longer keeps in touch with anyone from Cheers, because the face that greets him at their airport is an unfamiliar one: Frasier’s best friend since his Oxford days, Alan (Nicholas Lyndhurst), making his first-ever appearance in Dr. Crane’s four decades of existence as a TV character. Though his real passion is alcohol, Alan is a psychology professor at Harvard, where Frasier’s high-strung nephew David (Anders Keith) happens to be an undergrad. Practically the moment he arrives, Alan’s ambitious department head Olivia (Toks Olagundoye) offers Frasier a faculty job. (The sound you hear is a nation’s worth of unemployed PhDs groaning.) Of course he takes it. If nothing else, the move promises to give him a chance to reconnect with his semi-estranged, 33-year-old son Freddy (Jack Cutmore-Scott), a Harvard dropout turned Boston firefighter. (The wordHarvardcomes up often in this show.) With this multigenerational ensemble, Harris and Cristall seem intent on replicating the dynamics of the canonicalFrasiercast without actually bringing back Grammer’s old co-stars. (Peri Gilpin is slated to guest star at some point in the season as Frasier’s producer Roz, but she wasn’t in any of the five episodes sent for review.) Once again, there are the effete snobs and the salt-of-the-earth people who tolerate them. Freddy is the show’s answer to Martin, a retired cop. The actress he lives with, Jess Salgueiro’s Eve—a character whose backstory I’ve been asked to avoid discussing, not that it makes for an especially exciting reveal—is the Daphne-like ingénue. Olivia drives the status-conscious Harvard plots, like a Type A Roz, restoring the original show’s balance of family and workplace comedy. David, a delicate soul prone to fits of anxiety, and Alan, a sometimes rival who’s quick withbon mots, fill in for Niles. But let’s be real. There’s no replacing Frasier and Niles’ frenemy (bronemy?) rapport, which fueled endless sibling-oneupmanship story arcs rendered gently hilarious by the narcissism of two very similar narcissists’ small differences. And there’s certainly no replacingDavid Hyde Pierce’s performance as Niles, whose feline mannerisms and puppy-dog panting after Jane Leeves’ Daphne made him the show’s breakout character. (In case you were wondering, the market forextremelyspecificNilesCranetributemerchis booming.) Grammer disappears back into his signature role, but without his one true sparring partner, Frasier feels adrift. It’s not that the supporting cast is a complete bust. Lyndhurst can be pretty funny as a glib, dissipated British academic of a certain age. Salgueiro adds some much-needed effervescence and charm to a relatively low-energy milieu. But the show strains to find reasons to throw these characters together in humorous situations. Harris and Cristall invent a third-space pub whose clientele appears to consist solely of firefighters and Harvard faculty; Eve is the bartender. For a college student living on campus, David—who comes across as a collection of neuroses more than a fleshed-out character—spends an alarming amount of time with his uncle and cousin. The writing, in other words, disappoints. Gone is the fizzy dialogue ofFrasier’s heyday, replaced by dated “Baby Shark” gags and broad exchanges like the one in which Freddy notes that a new (spoiler-y) development in his life is “not exactly catnip for ladies” and David—who is, again, studying at America’s most prestigious institution of higher learning—marvels: “There’s catnip for ladies?” One early episode recycles a plot the original series did at least once, as Frasier, Alan, and Olivia all vie for two open membership slots at an exclusive faculty club. The tone feels off, too. It’s nice that the new episodes were filmed in front of a live audience, but their laughter, which reads as artificial in 2023, makes the revival feel too much like a kitschy throwback. Frasier’s quest to prove, after a couple of decades as an overeducated talk-show host, that he’s got more substance than, say, Dr. Philmakes for a decent premise. But his guilt over passing his daddy issues onto the next generation is more of a bummer than a light comedy can support. The show needs more jokes and less earnest emoting, at the very least. Still, I’m not convinced that any amount of tweaking would be enough to justify its existence. The newFrasierpresumably exists to capitalize on the new audience that the NBC original, a ’90s Must See TV staple, has found on streaming platforms. In 2017, the critic Lili Loofbourowmade the casethat it was the ideal show to fall asleep watching; a few months later, The Ringer went so far as to dub the languorous Friday after ThanksgivingFrasierDay. And just last year, a roundtable ofAtlanticwriterspronouncedFrasierthe ultimate comfort show. The consensus is, essentially, that we still loveFrasierbecause, in this age of struggle and strife, it feels uniquely luxurious to sink into a warm bath of Clinton-era rich-people problems. Who wouldn’t want to take a 22-minute virtual vacation to a time when conflicts between white-collar snobs and blue-collar populists ended in a shared chuckle rather than, I don’t know, an insurrection? It’s impossible to recreate the same soothing atmosphere today, although Harris and Cristall do wisely avoid political hot topics. (Among other groan-worthy possibilities, this spares us from hearing Dr. Crane crack jokes about nonbinary pronouns, like every other nonplussed baby boomer in a multi-cam comedy since 2016.) Not even the return of Niles, Daphne, and the rest could have compensated for the loss of the show’s original context.Frasier—all 264 infinitely rewatchable episodes of it—will always be a comforting place to visit. But central to its appeal, which only increases with age, is our awareness that we could never live there in the present."

Particles come partly from natural sources such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires, and partly from pollution and emissions. Aerosol researcher Johan Friberg studies particles at high altitudes. He fears that the global increase in forest fires could have a significant impact on the ozone layer.""I study the air in the stratosphere and the upper part of the troposphere. I want to try and explain variations in the prevalence of aerosol particles, and I have recently become interested in the stratospheric zone"" explains Johan Friberg, researcher at MERGE (ModElling the Regional and Global Earth system) at Lund University.The troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere, and it contains three quarters of the atmosphere's total mass, including almost allwater vaporand aerosol particles. In the troposphere, our various weather systems are formed. Above that, at 15–50 kilometers above sea level, we have the stratosphere, which includes the ozone layer that, among other things, protects Earth fromultraviolet radiation(UV radiation).What role do particles play in the atmosphere?Aerosol particles can both spread and absorb sunlight, which can have cooling or warming effects on the climate. They also affectcloud formationsince water does not condense by itself, it needs particles in order to form cloud droplets. That, in turn, affects the Earth's radiation balance.In lower layers of air in the troposphere, clouds form around particles, which means that they soon fall as precipitation. That does not happen in the stratosphere, where no precipitation forms. Instead, the particles follow air currents and can be spread globally within that layer.""In the stratosphere, the aerosol particles affect the ozone, causing it to break down and making the protective layer thinner. This was plain to see after the largest volcanic eruption in the modern age, from Pinatubo in 1991. The eruption emitted millions of tons of particles into the stratosphere, where they remained for several years,"" Johan Friberg explains.Humans create freonsThe hole in thestratospheric ozoneis caused by freons being activated into ozone-depleting substances. Freons are synthetic substances that we have created. They do not occur naturally, but human emissions of freons have caused them to spread all over the stratosphere. Large ozone holes form over Antarctica because the stratosphere over the polar region is very cold in winter.A type of cloud called mother of pearl forms there. These clouds containice crystals, and on the surface of the crystals the freon activation happens much faster than it does in the air.""Like mother of pearl clouds, particles fromforest firesandvolcanic eruptionscan activate freons. They can also affect the number of ice crystals in the cloud and therefore ozone depletion. The combination of these two factors leads to holes in the ozone layer and more UV radiation reaching us,"" explains Johan Friberg.The effect of forest fires should be studied furtherAfter the Australian fires in 2019 and 2020, the concentration of ozone in the Southern Hemisphere fell and ozone holes formed outside the polar region. If the fires were to occur in the Northern Hemisphere, thedamaging effectsof reduced protection from dangerous UV radiation would have consequences for billions of people, as well as animal and plant life, including vital agricultural production.For the most part, existing research data comes from satellites and is suitable for studying the recent past, but from the large volcanic eruption of 1991 and further back, there is not much data available.Johan Friberg wants to research further back in time and in greater detail, to be sure of what effects the increasing number of forest fires globally might have. There are several reasons why forest fires occur, but we see an increase both because of climate change and causes that are linked to modern forestry methods.""There are still many unanswered questions and more to explore at a detailed level,"" Johan Friberg argues. ""We do not know how much previous forest fires have affected theozone layer, which is why more research is needed.""Provided byLund UniversityCitation: Increase in forest fires may damage the crucial ozone layer (2023, October 9) retrieved 4 November 2023 "

Over Victoria's long weekend, campers and residents in Gippsland had toflee fast-moving fires, driven by high winds.The megafires of the 2019–2020 Black Summer came off the back of an earlier El Niño climate cycle. Now, after three years of rain and floods, El Niño is arriving on Australian shores again. With it comes fire weather—hot, dry and windy.The question is—are we ready?Last week, emergency management minister Murray Watt moved to reassure an anxious country. ""Australia is much better prepared for this season than we were heading into Black Summer,"" he said,speaking aftera national summit ondisaster preparedness.Yes, authorities are better prepared. But by and large, we as individuals are not. Far too often, Australians think it's the job of the authorities to be ready, which breeds a false sense of security.This fire season may pack a punchThe Black Summer bushfires of the 2019–20 summer were a stark reminder of how fire prone Australia is. But they were more than that—they were not normal. Around 20% of all of our forests went up in flame.2019 was thehottest and driestyear on record for Australia. But 2023may break that record, as climate records topple around the world and extreme weather events multiply. This year is likely to be the hottest on record globally, and next year the recordmay well fall again.Sustained rain from three successive La Niña years has driven widespread vegetation growth across Australia's 125 million hectares of forest, bush and grasslands. Over the coming weeks, many areas could dry out quickly and become tinder for bushfires.Climate cycles do give us time to prepareAustralia's wet-dry climate cycles have one benefit—during wet years, fire authorities get a reprieve. That lets governments,emergency servicesand the communitycoordinate, plan and prepareforbushfireseasons ahead.That's why Minister Watt can accurately claim Australia is better prepared. The capacity and capability of our emergency services to predict the spread of fires and issue timely warnings to communities is better than it has ever been. In planning and preparedness fornatural hazardssuch as bushfires and floods, we have seenbetter integrationbetween government, emergency services, civil and private sector organizations.Planned burning is still a challenge. It's tough to find the right weather conditions to burn off fuel loads at low intensity, without risking the blaze spreading or threatening property.But these burns are done much morestrategically these days. Rather than simply aim to hit a target of hectares burned, authorities are now focused on burning fuel in areas where it could endanger lives and damage critical infrastructure during bushfire season.These advances give us good reason for confidence. But not for complacency.Every bushfire is unique. And our fires are, by and large,getting worse. It would be an error to think our investment insmoke-detecting algorithms and satellite monitoringand the development of the newAustralian Fire Danger Rating Systemwill spare Australia from the loss of life, property andenvironmental destructionobserved during the Black Summer fires.Why? Decades of bushfires have shown even the best preparation can be found wanting on days of severe bushfire danger when firestorms can develop quickly and behave unpredictably.For Australia to be ready, you need to be readyWhile megafires happen—and draw the most headlines—most bushfires are local rather than national events.That means we must prepare at a local level.If you're faced with a bushfire threat, you have onlytwo options.You can stay and defend your property—as long as you are physically and mentally prepared, have adequate firefighting resources, and your property is prepared and defensible.Or you can leave early, which means making a judgment call about the best time to go in a calm manner. That doesn't mean panic—if there is time, it can be possible to do things like clear fuels from around the home and dampen the surrounds to give your house a better chance of surviving undefended.Which should you choose? It depends, in part, on where you live and your personal circumstances. Remember too that most Australians will never experience a bushfire firsthand.Every community has a different risk profile and people and communities vary considerably in their levels of preparedness and planning.If a fire does start and head towards your house, you could be taken entirely by surprise if you have no bushfire plan.To be clear, this is arguably the largest gap in Australia's fire preparedness.Planning is easy, if done aheadThe question of whether Australia is ready for the fire season should be reframed. The better question is: are Australians ready?The good news is, it's easier than you think to make a fire plan. As a household, it might take just 10 minutes. Your state or territory government has a website showing you how:VictoriaNew South WalesQueenslandSouth AustraliaWestern AustraliaAustralian Capital TerritoryNorthern TerritoryTasmaniaWhy plan ahead? Because it is vastly better to have a clear plan at your fingertips rather than frantically trying to figure out where your loved ones are, whether it's too late to leave and whether you could realistically fight the fire—when the fire is on your doorstep. Faced by the reality offire, many of us can freeze.What firefighters want us to learn is that the critical decisions and actions which save lives and property in a bushfire are taken by us and our communities, not by politicians or agencies."

As far as the eye can see, there is the same desolate landscape.""There is little chance that this forest will be able to regenerate. The trees are too young to have had time to form cones which ensure the next generation,"" says Maxence Martin, a professor of forest ecology at the University of Quebec in Abitibi-Temiscamingue.In this remote region, forestry is the main industry, supporting entire towns with the 60,000 direct and indirect jobs linked to it. But both the industry and the wildfires have significantly reshaped the landscape.Some 18 million hectares (nearly 70,000 square miles) of land was torched this year in Canada's largest ever fire season.Losing one third of forest""If we continue on the current trend (of fires), by 2100 as much as one third of theboreal forestin Quebec will have been lost,"" says Martin, slaloming among the regrowth starting to poke through the scorched ground.This area is part of a vast ring of greenery which encircles the Arctic, stretching from Canada through Alaska, Siberia and northern Europe to form the largest expanse of wilderness in the world.Fires here are fueled by drier and hotter conditions caused by climate change. And by releasinggreenhouse gassesinto the atmosphere, these fires in turn contribute to global warming, in a vicious circle.Another particularity of this northern forest: it releases 10 to 20 times more carbon per unit of burned area than other ecosystems.That's helped Canada's emissions reach unprecedented levels, at 473 megatons this year. That's more than three times higher than the previous record, according to data from Europe's Copernicus observatory.And in the boreal forest, due to the thickness of the humus on the ground, fires can continue to burn for months.""When we explain to people that the fires will only really be extinguished with snow, everyone becomes eager for winter to arrive,"" Guy Lafreniere, the mayor of Lebel-sur-Quevillon, a small Quebec town of 2,000 residents who had to evacuate twice this summer, says with a smile.Homes were saved thanks to the nearby lake which halted the advance of the fire. But the whole summer was disrupted, no child finished theirschool yearand hundreds of small chalets built in the forest for weekends and vacations were destroyed.Today the city is surrounded by fire breaks, built during the blazes. A ring of conifers—which are very flammable—were chopped down.""We had a helicopter dumping water on the machines as they moved along chopping down the trees, so the machines didn't themselves catch on fire,"" the mayor recalled.Canada's fires were fueled by drier and hotter conditions caused by climate change -- and by releasing greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, these fires in turn contribute to global warming.OverwhelmedMuch of Canada, including the far north, is facing extreme drought conditions. Lightning storms earlier this year were triggering hundreds of fires in a single day.Firefighters, authorities and residents were overwhelmed and declared emergencies persisting through the summer.""People had five minutes to leave their homes and hit the road. It was intense and stressful, especially since there was a lot of smoke and we could see the flames very close,"" says Doris Nolet, in charge of volunteer firefighters from Normetal, another evacuated Quebec village.""It was the first time that we were faced with forest fires. We know how to take care of houses, car fires, but not forest fires,"" she adds.""We had a strange summer,"" confirms Omer Riviere, who lives in this village and remains traumatized at having lost his chalet in theforestwhere ""he had old furniture and, above all, so many memories.""For the first time in its history, almost all Canadians were affected by this year'sfireseason, either directly or because they had to deal with the smoke, which traveled thousands of miles—repeatedly polluting the air across North America and even parts of Europe.""We need to think deeply. It's not Europe here, we don't have the means to fight all the fires. They are too far away, too big, too inaccessible—so we have to be proactive,"" suggests Natural Resources Canada's Marc-Andre Parisien.While the mega fires of 2023 are now smoldering, they'll almost certainly be back again."

Much of this damage to communities could be reduced with better wildfire preparedness—but wildland urban interface (WUI) communities often face significant barriers in implementing these improvements, according to a study by York University's Disaster and Emergency Management researchers.According to the study,Determinants of residential wildfire mitigation uptake: A scoping review, 2013–2022, published in theFire Safety Journal, there are many residentialwildfiremitigation and educational programs to protectresidential communitiesfrom wildfires and to help prevent related disasters.""Unfortunately, knowing how to protect and mitigate the risk to WUI communities from wildfire is not sufficient,"" says Professor Eric B.

""Understanding what will lead to adoption of prevention measures is a high-priority issue to better prepare for future wildfire seasons.""These kinds of studies—known as scoping reviews—help to identify patterns and consensus in scientific research. Kennedy's co-author and York graduate Sarah Cowan presented the results today at the 14th International Symposium on Fire Safety Science, IAFSS2023, held in Tsukuba, Japan. She highlighted that based on their review of 78 academic journal articles published in the last decade, several individual and social factors that contribute to a lack of preparedness were identified.""We found a number of things that might help to increase wildfire preparedness. For example, many studies that we reviewed documented how the lack of money, time, resources orphysical abilitycan impair the ability to make improvements to a property,"" highlights wildfires researcher Kennedy.""For instance, many of the home improvements can be expensive, and if you don't have the money, financial support, or even support from yourinsurance companywith incorporating improvements during rebuilding, it can be really challenging to make a difference. Same thing if we have an aging population. Cutting back vegetation or emptying and cleaning your eavestroughs can be physically demanding.""The authors saw a pattern in how some residential organizations can negatively impact wildlife preparedness.""Studies also showed that rules and norms set by some homeowners' associations can sometimes make properties more vulnerable and more likely to burn,"" says Kennedy. ""For instance, if they were trying to preserve certain aesthetics, they might use materials that burn more easily or capture embers from nearby fires.""He adds that homeowners' associations and municipalities should ensure building codes are in line with best practices to prevent such disasters.""There really is an opportunity to broaden out the locations where these studies are being done. We need more research with more communities to help us understand how to develop solutions that can work across diverse contexts,"" Kennedy observes.The authors also note that a majority of the studies on this topic have been done in Australia, Canada and the US."

At the same time, more people are living in the wildland-urban interface (WUI) than ever before, an area that often has high or extreme fire risk.Barath Raghavan and colleagues investigate the potential of banana trees to act as a multifunctional fire buffer in the WUI. Banana trees have a high water content, ideal for stopping fire. When irrigated by recycled water, they can produce high-value crops.The team used a suite of models to simulate the behavior of the real 2017 Tubbs Fire, in Sonoma County, California, if banana tree buffers had been in place. Banana tree buffers 633 meters wide would have reduced the intensity of the fire by 96%, according to the model—a similar effect to that produced by treatingforest areaswith mechanical thinning and prescribed burning.When not slowing and calming fires, the banana trees could generate an estimated profit of $76,136 per hectare. Even if burned, bananas will resprout from their corms. Succulent ground covers could prevent flammable grasses from growing among the bananas.According to the authors, the results should be generally applicable to much of California, and to other areas with a Mediterranean climate, including regions of Mexico, Chile, Australia, and South Africa, and the Mediterranean Basin itself."

The latest incident occurred on Sunday evening in the district of Mbankolo, northwest of Yaounde, which is home to nearly three million people. Torrential rain caused a dam holding back an artificial lake sitting on higher ground to burst, according to public broadcaster CRTV. ""Yesterday we pulled out 15 people who had died and this morning we have found eight,"" the fire service's second in command David Petatoa Poufong told reporters at the site. ""We are still looking."" Distressed relatives watched as the bodies of some of the victims covered in sheets were driven away by firefighters, an AFP journalist saw. A security cordon was in place to keep onlookers and media back from the spot where the landslide happened. But images broadcast on TV showed an entire section of a hill had collapsed and what remained of houses apparently constructed from wood, dried earth bricks and metal sheeting. The remains of hillside dwellings that were swept away by the landslide could be seen in the distance, according to the AFP journalist. ""There was a landslide after heavy rain. The water swept away everything in its path,"" Daouda Ousmanou, a local administrative official announced on public radio. The onslaught of mud destroyed about 30 houses, according to CRTV, which showed images apparently from during the night of torrents of water and mud continuing to flow in places. In November last year, at least 15 people died when a landslide engulfed members of a funeral party in Yaounde's working-class district of Damas, on its eastern outskirts.

But a new study from SMU fire scientist Christopher Roos published in the journalNature Ecology & Evolutionshows that climate is an undervalued part of the equation.Roos, SMU environmental archaeologist and professor of anthropology, traveled with his team to the Sigatoka River valley in southwestern Fiji in 2013, where they collected charcoal and stable carbon isotopes from deep soil cores to understand historic patterns of fire activity in the area. Different plants have distinct carbon isotopic signatures, which can provide information about past plant communities.The team found fires and fire-createdgrassy areasthat predatehuman settlementby millennia and actively corresponded to droughts likely driven by a regularly occurring weather pattern known as El Niño. El Niño events can alter precipitation patterns worldwide, makingenvironmental conditionsmore favorable for wildfires. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued an El Niño advisory in June, announcing the latest arrival of theclimateevent that continues to influence weather worldwide.Lighting strikes also act as a natural cause of wildfires, igniting plant material that acts as fuel.The impact of human settlement, farming activity (particularly the clearing and burning of land) and resulting deforestation of remote Pacific islands is well established in the scientific record, and research from the Roos team only confirms what Roos calls ""a modern environmental parable."" But the impact of climate must be considered, too, the study finds.""It struck me that these fires are not exclusively human-driven, because when I looked at earlier pre-human spikes in fire activity, those lined up with El Niños,"" said Roos. ""The combination of climate andhuman activitydrives island deforestation and increases wildfire activity. It may be that human activity is making the landscape more sensitive to those climate variations. But, it could also be that the climate is making the landscape more sensitive to human activity.""In the past, Roos said, research often focused more on human activity harming Pacific Islands' land without considering climate's role in the damage. He believes an approach that considers both causes is necessary, especially with catastrophic wildfire events occurring more regularly.Roos also points out that the Pacific Islands are natural laboratories to study the grass-fire cycle, which is prevalent in areas where wildfire is occurring with the spread of invasive grasses. Traditional farmers have practiced successful techniques for clearing and burning land for centuries, and past lessons could offer ways to prepare and cope with future wildfire events. Roos stresses that we must adapt to the new environment climate and humans have created.""Droughts triggered by El Niño events appear to have played a role in intensifying the grass-fire cycle and contributing to deforestation in the past,"" he said. ""And looking forward, climate models indicate that the Pacific Islands could experience conditions similar to El Niño events more frequently due to ongoing climate change. We need to reflect on what we're doing and whether or not those actions make places more or less vulnerable to futurewildfireevents."""

In a new report published in the journal BioScience, researchers analyze what they describe as 35 planetary vital signs used to track climate change. They found that 20 of the 35 signs are at new extremes. While most of those are bad records, a few actually represent positive steps. The vital signs, which include things like ice sheet melt, greenhouse gas emissions, meat production, tree cover loss, and billion-dollar flood events, highlight the interconnectedness of the climate crisis. For example, the report references the rate of ice loss in Greenland, which in turn contributes to sea level rise. Other records include our ever-rising methane emissions and carbon dioxide emissions; meanwhile, fossil fuel subsidies (another vital sign they tracked) are at an all-time high. Experts warn the world must scale back fossil fuel infrastructure to stop the planet from hitting 1.5 degrees of warming above preindustrial levels. “Without actions that address the root problem of humanity taking more from the Earth than it can safely give, we’re on our way to the potential collapse of natural and socioeconomic systems and a world with unbearable heat and shortages of food and freshwater,” Christopher Wolf, one of the study authors, said in a statement. William Ripple, study author and professor at the Oregon State University College of Forestry, said he’s especially worried about countries lowering overall emissions. If we don’t cut out fossil fuels, the planet may find itself in a dangerous feedback loop that will only worsen the sort of events that have occurred in 2023, he warned. “I’m shocked at the frequency and intensity of climate-related disasters this year. It seems like they’re happening most every day in the summer in the Northern Hemisphere,” he told Earther. “Some places are having repeated climate related disasters, one after another, so they can’t even recover from the previous one. This is quite disturbing.” Back in 2019, Ripple and many other concerned climate scientists published another paper on the climate emergency. That report outlined six areas where policymakers could take more action, including restoring ecosystems and cutting a range of emissions. Ripple says he expected climate change-related extremes to continue to increase over time since then. But some moments in 2023 shocked him, like seeing images of the New York City skyline shrouded in smoke from Canadian wildfires. Or learning that so much smoke was produced, it broke pollution records in just a few months. “The number of wildfires and the smoke. It is quite jarring,” he said. “The area that burned in Canada is off the charts.” A small handful of the records in the list of 20 vital signs are actually positive. Study authors pointed out that about $39 trillion was divested or pledged to be divested from the fossil fuel industry in 2021. The consumption of renewable energy from wind and solar grew about 17% between 2021 and 2022. However, it is still several times less than fossil fuel energy consumption worldwide, according to the report. The report also notes that more than 2,000 country, regional, and city governments have declared climate emergencies, which counterintuitively is cause for some tentative hope, Ripple told Earther. “The first thing about addressing any big problem is to admit to it and raise awareness,” he said. The new report emphasizes that our financial and energy systems are the problem—not simply the number of people (8 billion) on the planet. Wealthy individuals and wealthy nations emit so much more than everyone else, by using private jets and living in larger, multiple homes that guzzle water during droughts. “We therefore need to change our economy to a system that supports meeting basic needs for all people instead of excessive consumption by the wealthy,” the study authors wrote. “Climate justice and social justice topics need to be part of the discussion for both climate mitigation and climate adaptation,” Ripple said.

Additionally, the ecological effects of ON aerosol depositions are anticipated to increase due to global warming and the decrease in nitrogen oxide emissions from human activities.The study was led by Dr. Yumin Li of Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), in collaboration with Professor Tzung-May Fu's team at SUSTech and Professor Jian Zhen Yu's team at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). The research ispublishedin the journalNational Science Review.Atmospheric deposition of organic nitrogen (ON) plays a crucial role in theglobal nitrogen cycle. Surface measurements showed that 2% to 70% of the local atmospheric deposition flux of total nitrogen was organic. However, previous models have largely neglected the spatial and chemical variations of atmospheric ON, leading to inadequate assessment of its global impacts.The scientists from SUSTech and HKUST developed a comprehensive global model of atmospheric gaseous and particulate ON, incorporating the latest knowledge on emissions and secondary formations. Their simulated surface concentrations of atmospheric particulate ON (ONp) were highly consistent with global observations, a feat that had not been achieved previously. In addition, their simulated atmospheric deposition flux aligned with global observations within an order of magnitude.The scientists estimated that the global atmospheric ON deposition was 26 Tg N yr-1. This majority of this deposition (23 Tg N yr-1) occurred in the form of ON aerosol and accounted for 19% of the global atmospheric total N deposition (124 Tg N yr-1). The main sources of ON aerosols were wildfires, ocean emissions, and secondary formation.""Our simulation showed that the deposition of ON aerosol from the atmosphere is a crucial external source of nitrogen to nitrogen-limited ecosystems worldwide, such as theboreal forests, tundras, and the Arctic Ocean,"" Fu says.In a future warming climate, wildfires will likely become more frequent and intense. Climate warming will also lead to surface ocean stratification, making atmospheric ON deposition an increasingly important source of nitrogen to these ecosystems. ""We need to further examine the environmental impacts of atmospheric ON aerosol and how those impacts respond toclimate change."""

The fire erupted early Wednesday in the Drava International factory complex in the town of Osijek, spreading quickly and sending thick dark smoke high in the air. Emergency services said that large amounts of plastics stored in an open area were on fire, making it difficult for firefighters to control the raging blaze. “The temperature is unbelievable, horrible,” said Boris Banjan, deputy commander of the regional firefighting unit. “Our equipment is melting.” The state HRT television reported that three firefighters were injured, including one seriously. The report said firefighters managed to take out large amounts of flammable liquid from the fire zone, preventing further incidents. The fire also forced the closure of a road, police said. Some schools canceled classes for the day. The TV said a strong wind fueled the spread of the polluted smoke. Burning of plastics releases toxic gases but the level of pollution was not immediately clear. The civil protection authorities in the area urged citizens to “close down their windows and not go out unless absolutely necessary.” The Index news portal reported that some residents living in the suburbs close to the factory were leaving their homes and staying with relatives until the fire is extinguished. The Drava International factory produces plastic packaging and other products. Croatian media reported that there have been four incidents in the factory in the past 12 years, killing one person."

EDT SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the State Department. Prime Minister Albanese, Ms. Haydon, it is wonderful to have you with us here today. My wife, Evan, and I are delighted â€” please take a seat. Thank you. Thank you, Kevin, for the protocol tip. (Laughter.) We are so delighted to welcome you both, to welcome all of our friends from Down Under to the top of the State Department. (Laughter.) I think, as we all saw and heard so clearly yesterday, the Prime Minister is a true partner and true friend to the United States and President Biden. (Applause.) I've had the opportunity since the Prime Minister has been in office to admire up close his remarkable combination of strength, empathy, and decency. One couldn't ask for more in a partner and a friend. And I know that Jodie equally shares those traits â€” your remarkable work now, particularly in trying to deal with cancer, something so close to President Biden's heart, as you know. And we're grateful to you for your friendship as well. Now, there are a few things that â€” for most public officials, virtually everything is â€” is known and out in public. But I want to share one thing that may not be so well known to the American audience here today. Maybe it's known to the Australians. The Prime Minister and I have a deep shared affection for music. When it comes to the Prime Minister, he's also known, besides ""Prime Minister,"" as ""DJ Albo."" (Laughter.) He's known to spin a mean disc. And maybe there'll be an opportunity at some point later to hear that. I especially also want to thank our partners, our friends, our co-hosts today: the Vice President, Vice President Harris, and Doug Emhoff. (Applause.) It is â€” it's especially fitting because the Vice President has been such a strong leader in our foreign policy, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, since the start of this administration, as well, of course, in response to the current crisis in the Middle East. And our Second Gentleman, Doug Emhoff, who has led our efforts to combat antisemitism and other forms of bigotry at home and around the world. Something that could not be more urgent in this moment. Thank you, Doug. (Applause.) It is also wonderful to see members of Congress, members of the President's Cabinet here with us today. I know the Prime Minister had a very good session on Capitol Hill a short while ago. We're grateful for that. And it's good to be with so many friends, especially in the midst of tremendous pain and loss at home as well as around the world. Our hearts are, of course, with loved ones of people who were killed in the horrific shooting last night in Lewiston, Maine, along with the many who are injured. We wish them the speediest of recoveries. And I know the Vice President shares this sentiment and will speak to it as well. I have to tell you, this lunch today is particularly meaningful for me on a personal level. My late stepfather, Samuel Pisar, survived the horrors of the Holocaust. He was one of 900 schoolmates in Bialystok, Poland; he's the only one who survived. And after enduring Treblinka, Dachau, Majdanek, and Auschwitz, he found refuge with aunts and uncles who had gone to Australia from Poland before the war. For him, Australia was truly a lucky country. He met teachers who inspired, mentors who guided him. He rekindled his passion for life, for intellectual pursuits, and for the future that he'd ultimately build here in the United States. He was, in many ways, as he used to tell us, reborn in Australia. And last year, I had the opportunity to visit the University of Melbourne, where he studied. So, there's been a profound bond between my family and Australia going back as long as I can remember. And I think his experience speaks in just one unique way to the kinship between our countries that goes back to our earliest days. Our first interactions in the 1790s consisted primarily of American ships delivering enormous quantities of spirits to very thirsty Aussies. (Laughter.) Now, that's a tradition that we hope to maintain this afternoon. (Laughter.) By the middle of the 20th century, as our relationship deepened and we cemented our formal alliance, Prime Minister Robert Menzies would observe that Australia and America share an affinity that reaches our souls. Now, we might view different constellations at night, but the United States and Australia see the world in much the same way. We're both nations of immigrants. We braved unforgiving oceans to get there. We're both fierce believers in democracy, equality, opportunity for all of our citizens, and in the need to keep working day in, day out to actually make those ideals real. That affinity is why our militaries have stood side by side for so many years, from the Coral Sea to Kandahar; why our companies invest in each other's economies; why our researchers and Fulbright Scholars flock to each other's shores. And as we inaugurate a new era of our strategic cooperation, our own alliance continues to evolve to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of this time. We're advancing peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and well beyond, rooted in a shared commitment that we have to a world that's free, that's open, that's secure, that's prosperous. We're updating our defense posture in Australia. We're strengthening and weaving together partnerships across the region, including the Quad, including AUKUS, as well as demonstrating our strong support for institutions like ASEAN and the Pacific Islands Forum. And we're upholding the principles at the heart of the United Nations Charter in Ukraine where they're challenged, where Australia continues to be the largest non-NATO contributor to Ukraine's defense. We're also building an Innovation Alliance for the 21st century, from shaping the future of AI and quantum technologies, to laying new undersea cables, to deepening our partnership in outer space. We know that central to every single one of these initiatives, every single one of these partnerships are people bound by shared history, heritage, culture. I've had the wonderful privilege of experiencing this on several visits Down Under over the years. We see the deep ties between us in this country, as well. Australia â€” and we thank you again â€” has given us Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie â€” (laughter) â€” not to mention not one, not two, but three Hemsworth brothers. (Laughter.) Nick Cave performed in Washington just last month. D.C. residents pop into Bluestone Lane to stay caffeinated. (Laughter.) Countless American children have shared belly-aching laughs while watching ""Bluey"" â€” and I can speak directly to this in the case of my own kids. (Laughter.) Every single day, in so many different ways, in so many different pursuits, we're reminded that we're joined together. And precisely because of our partnership, even in challenging times â€” indeed, especially in challenging times, as the Prime Minister said yesterday â€” there is profound cause for hope. So, if we could start by raising a glass to two great mates and to the future that we will continue to write together. (Secretary Blinken offers a toast.) Cheers, everyone. Cheers. PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE: Cheers. SECRETARY BLINKEN: And now it is my great pleasure and great honor to introduce the Vice President of the United States. (Applause.) VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Good afternoon. Good afternoon. First and foremost, I want to thank, among friends, our Secretary of State. You have all witnessed his career over many years â€” dedicated career to our country and to our values and principles. And, most recently, you have been extraordinary in terms of your fortitude, your commitment, your integrity, and your stamina â€” (laughter) â€” to stand for what is right and to represent our country in the most important and noble way. Can we please applaud our Secretary? (Applause.) And to, then, our Secretary Blinken, Ms. Evan Ryan, Doug and I are honored to co-host this luncheon with you and to welcome, of course, the Prime Minister of Australia and our dear friend, Prime Minister Albanese. Mr. Prime Minister, it is good to see you again. Yesterday, the day before, and after getting together in Tokyo, Bangkok, and Jakarta this past year. (Laughter.) We've spent some time together. I also want to welcome the members of the United States Congress who are here, the members of the President's Cabinet who are here, and all of our distinguished guests. As the Secretary said, before I address why we are convened here today, I will address the tragic events that happened last night in Maine. Last night, Lewiston became yet another community torn apart by senseless gun violence. Once again, routine gatherings â€” this time at a bowling alley and a restaurant â€” have been turned into scenes of horrific carnage. Doug and I mourn for those who were killed. We pray for those who are injured and grieve with so many whose lives are forever changed and impacted by what happened. The Biden-Harris administration will continue to provide full support to local authorities. And as we gather details, we must continue to speak truth about the moment we are in. In our country today, the leading cause of death of American children is gun violence. Gun violence has terrorized and traumatized so many of our communities in this country. And let us be clear, it does not have to be this way, as our friends in Australia have demonstrated. And with that then â€” (applause) â€” and with that then, I will turn to the Prime Minister's state visit. I believe, as do most of us, that the strength of the relationship between nations is much like the strength of the relationships in our personal lives. It requires trust, candor, and follow-through. It is born out of shared experiences, shared tests, and triumphs. And it is sustained through mutual respect, mutual interest, and mutual admiration. And although a great distance may separate us, the bond of friendship draws us forever close. Prime Minister Albanese, Australia is a dear friend to the United States of America. The bond between our nations was solidified and strengthened in times of global turmoil, where freedoms that define each of our nation were at stake: from the arrival of U.S. naval ships in Sydney Harbor in 1908, to American and Australian troops breaking open the Western Front in World War One; from General MacArthur's arrival in Australia, after Darwin was under attack during World War Two, to the Battle of the Coral Sea, as mentioned by the Secretary; and from the hilltops of the Korean Peninsula to the beaches of central Vietnam. And when America was attacked on 9/11, Australia, again, stood with us. As some may remember, Australian Prime Minister Howard was here in Washington, D.C., on that tragic day, and bore personal witness to the smoke rising from the Pentagon. In a demonstration of Australia's solidarity, the following day, he grieved alongside Americans at the United States Capitol and later at the National Cathedral. And days later, importantly, Australia invoked for the first time the ANZUS Treaty and then sent Australian soldiers to fight alongside American troops against al Qaeda terrorists. The United States is forever grateful that Australia stood with us through some of our greatest challenges and toughest moments. Our friendship runs deep. It exists between our people, our governments, and our leaders. And then, on a personal note, Prime Minister: Throughout our discussions, I have enjoyed that we share quite a similar perspective on a number of issues. For example, we have both talked about and fought for the benefit of workers, the LGBTQ+ community, the Indigenous People of our lands. And you and I agree that the climate crisis is indeed an existential crisis, and we have discussed extensively the work that we can do together â€” our first discussion being in Tokyo. Thank you, I want to say, in particular, for taking extraordinarily bold and courageous steps from the moment you took office to address this issue. I do believe that this leader has the ambition that is necessary to meet the crisis at this moment. I also thank you for your leadership and that of President Biden, where together we are accelerating the clean energy transition, investing in critical mineral supply chains, and growing our economies. As a daughter of California, I also must tell you that the firefighters in my home state are immensely thankful to the Australian firefighters who have come to their aid to help battle this crisis. (Applause.) And as the President said last night in his toast: As members of the Indo-Pacific, our nations also share a commitment to a free and open region, which is reinforced by our historic AUKUS partnership, the Quad, and our work together in the Pacific Islands in Southeast Asia. Last month, you and I were in Jakarta at the international summit that included 17 heads of Indo-Pacific nations. And your partnership, Mr. Prime Minister, was critical in that room. You spoke eloquently and clearly about the importance of international rules and norms, which of course are critical to our societies, both in terms of our security and prosperity. You spoke about ensuring democratic values and that they shape the future of this region. And last year, you and I, together with other global leaders, were in Bangkok to work on and in common cause what we must do to level the economic playing field for our businesses and our workers. There, you were also among a handful of leaders that I convened hours after North Korea's launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. We discussed a coordinated response. And I appreciate, again, how in that small room, you spoke with great clarity and conviction about condemning North Korea's destabilizing activities. And as the chair of the National Space Council, I'm particularly proud of our strong partnership in outer space. And importantly, with the support of Australia, the United States has been able to advance rules and norms for space, including the Artemis Accords. I will also publicly thank you for joining the commitment that we announced to not conduct direct descent anti-missile testing. And today, as part of this visit, our governments will sign a new agreement that will strengthen our commercial space partnership. In closing then, all this work together demonstrates a simple fact: Throughout our long and shared history and throughout the Biden-Harris administration, Australia has been a true and steadfast friend to the United States. And I know we will strengthen the relationship in the months and years ahead. I thank you for your lader- â€” leadership, and I will raise the glass and ask everyone to join as we raise the glass to the Prime Minister. (The Vice President offers a toast.) Thank you. AUDIENCE: Hear! Hear! VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: (Applause.) And now it is my honor to introduce Prime Minister Albanese. (Applause.) PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE: Well, thank you so much for that very generous introduction. To the Vice President, to the Secretary of State, it is a wonderful opportunity for me to be back here at the State Department. And I also welcome and acknowledge all of the members of the Cabinet, and members of Congress and Senate who are here, and my Australian friends who've traveled to be with us here. I do want to also begin by passing on my condolences to those affected by the shooting in Maine. Indeed, it is the case that we look every time there is one of these events and are grateful that Australia did act in a bipartisan way after the Port Arthur massacre in Australia. And my heart goes out to those who will be grieving today. We do meet at a time when our world faces a set of profound challenges. Far and wide, we're confronted by threats to peace and tests of the international rules-based order. And here in the United States, we can see the weight of global leadership that your great nation carries. I came to Washington this week to continue the work of facing our alliance to the future, strengthening our economic partnerships in cloud computing innovation and through a new Technology Safeguards Agreement that we'll sign at this lunch. Working with President Biden to turn the Climate and Clean Energy Compact we signed together in May into a commercial reality, with new progress on critical minerals and supply chains. But above all, in these challenging times, I stand here in Washington as the leader of America's steadfast ally. That's what the friendship between our nations means. We stand together in the cause of peace. We work together to build a more free, stable, and prosperous world. Eight decades ago, Australia looked to America when our own need was most dire. We recognize the world is looking to you now. And we know it does not look in vain. American leadership will meet this moment. And as allies, we will face the future together. Ladies and gentlemen, it remains a remarkable tribute to your nation, including many people who worked from this very building, that in the aftermath of the Second World War, America did not seek to rebuild a world governed by strength of arms, fear of force, or the will of one great power. Instead, as President Truman said, you sought a just and lasting peace, understanding that peace would only last so long as it was just. That is why your forebears worked with ours to give life and shape to the United Nations, to help build a postwar world of rules and rights, of essential freedoms and basic fairness; where every country, large and small, could shape its own destiny and the liberty of every individual is recognized; where peace is secured not solely by the presence of the great powers, but by the sovereign acts of middle powers and small nations, and the collective responsibility of the international community. Of course, that vision and those values have not gone unchallenged. We see this now in Ukraine, where Russia's illegal and immoral invasion seeks to subjugate an independent nation and oppress a free people. Australia may be half a world away from Ukraine, but we are proud to be one of the largest contributors to its military and humanitarian needs. (Applause.) We stand with Ukraine to support its courageous people, but also to defend a fundamental principle: the right of every sovereign nation to peace and security, and the responsibility of every sovereign nation to respect the rules that hold the world together, be it in Europe, in the Indo-Pacific, or indeed the Middle East. Australia unequivocally condemns the atrocities committed by Hamas and the destruction that their acts of terror have inflicted on innocent lives in Israel and in Gaza. And we stand with our international partners in calling for access to lifesaving humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza. In my time here, I've had the opportunity to personally thank the President for the courage and the leadership that he has shown. As a true friend of Israel, not only did he stand by them in this terrible time, he offered wisdom as well as solace â€” calling for all parties to allow safe, unimpeded, and sustained humanitarian access and safe passage for civilians. And the President used the power of his office to assert an undeniable principle that every innocent life must be protected â€” Israeli and Palestinian. That is American leadership in action. Generations of this leadership had been instrumental in shaping a world which is more prosperous, more open, more free, and more interconnected than any of our forebears could have imagined. Australia has benefited from this, and Australia has helped to build it. From my first day in office when I flew to Japan to take part in the Quad, the government I lead has made it a priority to reinforce the architecture of our region â€” investing in our capabilities and investing in our relationships; strengthening our vital links with Japan and Korea as a proven economic security and energy partner; deepening our engagement with Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, and across Southeast Asia; taking our strategic partnership with India to a new level, both bilaterally and through the Quad; strengthening the bond that we share with our Pacific Island family, where, for more than half a century, Australia has been the region's single-largest economic and development partner; investing in our multilateral engagement â€” the Pacific Islands Forum, ASEAN, and the East Asia Summit â€” and as founding members of APEC, the G20, and, of course, the United Nations. Because as a constructive middle power with global interests, we understand the value and importance of dialogue, which is why Australia strongly supports the Biden administration's efforts to maintain those open lines of communication between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. As a great American president and the father of the current U.S. ambassador to Australia proved 60 years ago during the Cuban crisis, the true measure of a superpower strength is the ability to pull the world back from the brink of conflict. Once again, that has become the test of our time. China has been explicit: It does not see itself as a status quo power. It seeks a region and a world that is much more accommodating of its values and interests. This is where it is the responsibility of every nation that has benefited from the stability and prosperity of the international rules-based order through the last three quarters of a century to work together and protect it, securing the sovereignty that confers every nation's right to determine its own destiny; protecting the freedom of navigation, which is central to our shared prosperity; upholding the human rights, which are central to every individual's life and liberty; and working together to maintain peace not just in the Taiwan Strait, but wherever it is at risk. This means investing in our capabilities to prevent competition escalating into conflict and investing in our relationships to maintain the dialogue that safeguards stability. And this is where Australia, just like the United States, has been working to stabilize our relationship with China. We're very clear-eyed about this. We're two nations with very different histories, values, and political systems. Australia will always look to cooperate with China where we can, but we will disagree where we must but continue to engage in our national interest. Our approach has been patient, calibrated, and deliberate. And that will continue when I visit Beijing and Shanghai next month. Secretary Blinken, you and so many of your colleagues today devote your energy and intellect to building a more stable and secure world, and it's been an incredible privilege to meet with you and with Vice President Harris in so many â€” so many parts of the world. And I'm glad it's finally here â€” (laughter) â€” in the United States. I have, of course, met with Secretary Blinken in Australia, and I look forward to welcoming you, Vice President Harris, to Australia at some â€” at some future time. This is absolutely critical, because striving for peace is hard work. It demands new effort, new resources, new creative â€” creativity, and new resolve. But whenever we consider the costs, the obstacles, or the difficulties of this course, we only need to consider the counterfactual, the alternative, because the closing off of economies, the collapse of diplomacy, the cutting of ties, the burden of conflict, and the devastation of war are catastrophic for the world. That elemental understanding was the basis of the alliance that the United States of America and Australia signed 72 years ago. Ours was not a pact against a mutual enemy. It was a pledge to a common cause. These were the words to which we put the names of our great nations: reaffirming our desire to live in peace with all peoples and all governments and desiring to strengthen the fabric of peace in the Pacific area. And it is in this same spirit that Australia has struck the new trilateral AUKUS agreement with the United States and the United Kingdom â€” a decision we have taken that is anchored in our own national sovereignty but is also in the sovereign national interests of the U.S. and the UK. From early on in the next decade, Australia will take delivery of U.S. Virginia-class, conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. This will be the first time in 65 years and only the second time in history that the U.S. has shared your nuclear propulsion technology. It speaks for the intersection of our interests, the deep trust underpinning our alliance, and the reality of the world in which we live. And up on the Hill this morning, I was struck by just how supportive on a bipartisan way â€” across Congress and the Senate â€” there is for AUKUS. This is â€” this is an unprecedented level of partnership, conceived for a time of unprecedented challenge. This technology offers Australia a new level of deterrence and a new capacity to contribute to the stability of our region and the security of our partners. For Australia, the rationale for AUKUS is straightforward. We want to contribute to strategic equilibrium in the Indo-Pacific. We're not looking for conflict; we are seeking to prevent it, making it crystal clear to any aggressor that the risk of conflict far outweighs any potential benefit. And the past few weeks have reminded us all that American leadership often means walking a lonely road and shouldering a heavy burden. As a friend, Australia walks beside you. And as an ally, we help you carry the weight, especially when the going gets tough. Of course, there will always be more challenges here at home that seem more pressing, more relevant, and more real than the concerns of other nations far away. It is natural â€” indeed, it is understandable â€” for some to greet any new call for American global engagement with ""Why us? Why now? Why there? Why again?"" But the promise of America has never been fulfilled in isolation. The greatness of America has never been confined to your borders. The people of Australia are not looking for a free ride. We're a middle power, and we're a leader in our own region. And Australians always pay our way. We pull our weight. We do our part. We always have. We always will. That's one of the points that I was making today to key members of the House and Senate in person. The AUKUS bills before Congress represent a multibillion-dollar boost to America's industrial base and a game-changing manufacturing opportunity for Australian workers. It will mean Australians and Americans can work and train side by side in allied shipyards. And beyond submarines, AUKUS will enable seamless cooperation between our two nations in defense science, technology, and industry to help meet the new strategic challenges of our time. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not my first time in this famous building. In my mid-20s, I was invited to take part in a State Department program. Obviously, the U.S. intelligence community saw something in me that, at the time, others didn't back home. (Laughter.) But, well chosen. (Laughter.) I asked to see the different ways that groups here interacted with American democracy. I got the full spread â€” the Sierra Club; from Planned Parenthood to the National Rifle Association. I got to see, in a six-week visit, the full length and breadth of your great nation. Yet, for all of the diversity of views and arguments across the different issues that I saw during that visit, there was also a unifying belief: a sense that ideas mattered and participation mattered â€” showing up, taking part, making a case. You spoke for a common faith in the power of people and also a shared respect for the responsibility of government. Those are the founding principles of both of our democracies. They are â€” they are ideals that the United States and the State Department seeks to share with people from every part of the world â€” citizens who want to help to solve the humanitarian challenges their nations are facing; people who want the world to act on climate change; people want to see the jobs and prosperity of new economic growth across their society in a shared way so we have economies that work for people, not people working for economies; and people who believe, as we all do, that the best way of achieving these goals is a system where representatives derive their power from the consent of the governed. Of course, this is not easy, and it's not predictable. But only dictatorships pretend to be perfect. Democracies are proud to be human. We serve a work in progress, a continuing search for a more perfect union, a shared desire to build a better world. And that's why all of us know that preserving democracy isn't just a matter of celebrating it. We have to nurture it, nourish it, strengthen it, renew it, and, yes, defend it, making sure that it has practical meaning for the people it serves and making sure it is ready for the future it seeks to shape. Everything that is true for our democracies is also true for our alliance. In a time of conflict, uncertainty, and rapid change, there's always the temptation for nations, democracies, and citizens to look back, to search for reassurance instead of seeking renewal. But as important as our rich history is, our alliance is firmly focused on the future, advancing the vital interests that we share and building on the universal values that we hold: democracy and peace, freedom and fairness. They are our North Star, our Southern Cross. They bring us together. They light our way. And they can still light the world. This is why ours is in alliance with a bright future, because it is an alliance for a better future. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to conclude with a toast to thank the Vice President and the Secretary but to toast our friendship between our great two nations. To the people of America, the people of Australia, and to an alliance for the future. (Prime Minister Albanese offers a toast.) (Applause.) END 1:25 P.M. EDT"

In a past life, Han Joon-o and Kang Young-hwa were lovers. That was after he killed her family and before she killed him in revenge, which could partly explain why they currently have mixed feelings about each other. That’s the premise of the Korean drama Moon in the Day, a present-day fantasy romance tangled up in a past-life tragedy. Joon-o, played by Kim Young-dae, was once a Silla general, who executed Young-hwa’s relatives. Today he’s an immature actor, who annoys friends and colleagues with his selfish behavior. Young-hwa, played by Pyo Ye-jin, is a brave firefighter, who makes the news for her exceptionally selfless acts. Her day job involves entering nightmare scenarios and she’s often troubled by actual nightmares which include traumatic scenes from what seems like a past life. Joon-o is playing a firefighter in his current drama, but he lacks the strength or skills required to fight any actual fires. A bit of a baby, he whines about having to carry a child on set. The two meet when he’s doing a PSA about firefighters and she’s asked for pointers on what firefighters actually do. His impatience leads to an accident, which—in a spooky blue-filtered scene—allows the spirit of his past self to inhabit his body. Once that vengeful spirit takes control he immediately recognizes Young-hwa as his former lover. Kim, who does a very enthusiastic job of being an annoying actor, is suddenly as grim as a brutal general can be. He’s also dangerously obsessed with Young-hwa. Their complicated past life relationship could inspire him to love her or kill her. Or maybe both. On a brighter note, now that Joon-o remembers how to brandish a sword, he’s ideal for a role in a historical drama, which his present-day self really wanted to play. Being possessed could have some benefits. It is noteworthy that a significant number of 2023’s romantic Korean comedies were fantasies. Several drama scripts required characters to solve problems from a past life or an alternate reality before they could hope to achieve happiness in this life or even live happily ever after. Moon in the Day is no exception. While it’s hard to change the past, these characters must defuse the shadows cast by their bad karma. Moon in the Day isn’t Kim’s first time playing a self-involved actor, as he played a star driving his agent crazy in the drama Shooting Stars. His most popular recent dramas include all three seasons of The Penthouse, When The Weather Is Fine and Extraordinary You. Pyo, who makes a very likable firefighter, knows something about revenge since she appeared in both seasons of the drama Taxi Driver. She also had notable roles in the dramas Revenant, Our Blooming Youth and VIP. The ENA/Genie TV production also stars On Joo-won, Jung Woong-in, Kim Dong-young and Lee Joon-hyuk.

Our alliance has been tried, tested, and has thrived over eight decades. We've stood side by side in the most difficult times. And just a few blocks from the White House and Capitol Hill, I witnessed for myself how Australians and Americans continue to strengthen these bonds. I was honoured to become the first Head of Government to visit the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Headquarters. Australians have too often witnessed the devastation of natural disasters. Right now, we are seeing bushfires take an awful toll in parts of Queensland and New South Wales. That's why visiting FEMA was a priority for me as Prime Minister. I wanted to personally recognise the courage, skill and dedication of emergency management personnel who are critical to responding to natural disasters. Australia and the United States have a proud history of being there for each other when it really counts. The toughest of times bring out the best in our people. Through fires and floods, we have rallied behind each other, protecting lives and livelihoods in both countries. The United States didn't hesitate in our hour of need, sending significant firefighting support during the 2019-20 Black Summer bushfires. American firefighters Captain Ian McBeth, First Officer Paul Hudson and Flight Engineer Rick DeMorgan Jr lost their lives in the service of our nation, when their water-bombing aircraft crashed near Cooma. And, more recently, Australia was proud to provide a large firefighting air tanker to Idaho to assist in firefighting across six US states. This visit wasn't just a chance for me to say thank you - it was an opportunity to talk about how we can keep working together to build our expertise, which is critical to building resilience. Our communities are already experiencing the debilitating impacts of climate change, from wildfires in California to floods in Victoria and New South Wales. That's why, in May, Australia's National Emergency Management agreed strengthened arrangements with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These arrangements will increase collaboration to improve our emergency response, including through formal sharing of best practice, employee exchanges and other mutually beneficial programs across the full spectrum of natural disasters. We'll work together to find the best ways to make sure our people are informed and up-to-date during emergencies, and counter misinformation that can be so dangerous during times of crisis. This complements the Climate, Critical Minerals, and Clean Energy Transformation Compact I signed with President Biden, which will see Australia and the United States collaborate to address domestic and regional climate risks, including increasingly frequent extreme weather events. At a time of global uncertainty, working with our global partners and making Australia's voice heard is vital. Whether it is climate change, the economy, or inflation, being part of these conversations means Australia gets to shape the solutions in our best interests. Australia is always best served when we take a seat at the table. And as this fire season begins, affirming our ties with FEMA makes a difference. It's one of the ways we are ensuring that in the toughest times, Australia can access world-class information and expertise to boost our response. President Biden and I are proud to work together, keeping the friendship between our countries strong as we confront the challenges ahead. And I'm proud that Australians and Americans are working together on the ground every day, keeping our people safe and secure, and facing the future with confidence.

Dead trees stand gray and bristly. An aura of doom hangs over the green conifers that remain.The expanse of Sierra National Forest near Shaver Lake is a relic of the climate before global warming. Scientists believe that the conifers won't be able to survive the current conditions. Researchers at Stanford University found in a recent study that roughly one-fifth of all conifer forests in the Sierra are mismatched with the warmer climate and have become ""zombie forests.""""The name 'zombie forest' is kind of kitschy, but I've come to find that it is haunting,"" said ecologist Avery Hill, who co-wrote the study while pursuing a doctorate at Stanford.Hill combed his way through a thicket one afternoon and paused at a clearing overlooking a valley, its pine-studded slopes dotted with boulders ringed by patches of shrubby chaparral.""That's what we think will spread out and eventually cover this whole area,"" he said.The findings indicate that these lower-elevation Sierra conifer forests, which include ponderosa pine, sugar pine and Douglas fir, are no longer able to successfully reproduce. Conditions have become too warm and dry to support conifer saplings, whose shallow roots require plenty of water if they are to survive into adulthood, Hill said. Giant sequoias also grow in lower-elevation areas of the Sierra Nevada, but the researchers didn't analyze the risks specific to those trees.When these forests burn in high-severity wildfires—or are wiped out by drought, disease or pests—they will likely be replaced by other types of trees and brush, the scientists said. That could dramatically slash how much carbon the region can store; provide a habitat for invasive species; and displace plants and animals that call the forests home.Knowing exactly where such changes might take place can help land managers prioritize where to resist the changes and where to accept or even accelerate them.""It provides almost an experimental space to address some really difficult questions about how we manage ecological transitions,"" said Hill, who now works at the California Academy of Sciences.Hill started his doctoral program knowing he wanted to study how human activity affects forests. Then the Nuns fire burned through the redwood forests of Napa, threatening his family home and destroying a shed. To Hill, it was a clear instance of the confluence of wildfire and climate change, leading him to focus on those topics.Zombie forests can persist for a long time without a disturbance to shake them up, Hill said, but research showed that many of the forests are headed for inevitable transitions with the 2.2 degrees of warming that has already occurred in the Sierra.These rapidly changing landscapes could have major implications for how California manages wildfire.Different types of forest burn in different ways, and knowing what will grow where could help authorities plan for fires, Hill said. For instance, chaparral historically supports catastrophic fire on average every 40 to 50 years, versus every 150 to 200 years for conifer forests, he said.""So maybe around communities, you'd prefer to have a well-managed conifer forest,"" he said.To determine which areas of forest are mismatched with thewarmer climate, the scientists examined detailed vegetation data from a U.S. Forest Service survey done in the 1930s. From that, they created a computer model to analyze habitat suitability, and found that while the average elevation of conifer forests has shifted upslope about 110 feet, the temperatures most suitable for the trees have retreated farther up the mountains, about 600 feet on average.They crafted a map of the Sierra splotched with pink—which shows where the forests are outside of the climate where they thrive—and red—where the mismatch is severe.While much of modern-day ecology is focused on understanding transitions by examining those that have already occurred, this map shows where changes are likely to take place, Hill said.""So we can start monitoring them and observing these transitions before they even start, and even start thinking about proactive management in these areas,"" he said.He described the study as a jumping-off point for more research, including whether wildfires burn differently in zombie forests and how that knowledge might be integrated into fire behavior modeling.Sarah Campe, regional scientist with the Sierra Nevada Conservancy, said she found the research thought-provoking. It added to an ongoing conversation about what the forests of the future will look like, she said. Still, she tends to view studies about landscapes' response to climate change with some skepticism.""These landscapes are incredibly complex,"" she said. ""I just don't think our models are there yet to actually be able to understand exactly what will happen.""Climate is just one driver of change affecting these ecosystems, Campe pointed out. More than a century ago, colonizers outlawed cultural burns by Indigenous groups and adopted aggressive fire-suppression policies, and later managed swaths of the region for timber.These practices deprived the Sierra's forests of the regular low-intensity fires to which they'd adapted, and resulted in the removal of the largest, most fire-resistant conifers. Many of these areas are now overcrowded with younger trees that burn more easily.""That has altered the structure and composition of these forests and made them vulnerable to wildfires, to drought and to warmer temperatures,"" she said. ""And certainly, climate is a huge and important driver in all of this, but that doesn't mean that there aren't levers that we can be pulling that aren't directly associated with carbon reduction to help protect these forests or restore these ecosystems.""Hill agreed, but said the researchers chose to focus primarily on climate because it's the foundational condition that determines whether a tree can grow in a particular place.""There are management decisions you can make to kind of squeeze out every last opportunity these trees have to survive by thinning these forests out or introducing prescribed burns or even seeding different species after logging,"" he said. ""But if the climate says no, the forest won't grow.""His team examined different scenarios of global warming and concluded that if humanity allows climate change to occur at rapid rates, nearly all of the Sierra Nevada could become unsuitable for conifer forests by the end of the century. They found that even with improved efforts to cut planet-heating emissions from fossil fuels and other sources of greenhouse gases, the Sierra zombie forests could still double in size this century. But they said efforts to rapidly address climate change could make a big difference.""It's a really stark reminder of how much climate change has already occurred, and how important it is to make sure that the amount that occurs in the future is as little as possible,"" said Chris Field, the study's senior author and director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. ""With aggressive efforts to controlclimate change, then we lose more of the Sierra, but not all of it.""Another nearby patch of land offers a window into what happens to a zombie forest after a disturbance. Three years ago, the Creek fire razed these slopes, its explosive intensity—which scientists likened to an incendiary bombing attack— stoked by millions ofdead treesthat had been weakened by drought and ravaged by bark beetles.Now, blackened spires jut up from the ground as far as the eye can see. Oaks have resprouted, but no conifer saplings are yet evident."" If our models are right, this is more likely than anywhere else to come back as something that's not conifer forest,"" Hill said as he peered out over the stunning devastation.There are measures land managers could take to plant and nurture conifer seedlings, Hill said, but he noted it would come down to resources, asking, ""Is it that important for these lower areas to come back as conifer forest?""Ron Goode, chairman of the North Fork Mono Tribe, said that since the Creek fire, the Mono winds that typically blew 60 to 70 mph had at times increased to 110 mph. And the snow and rains that fell last winter unleashed major flooding.""There's nothing to hold the snow, nothing to hold the water back,"" he said. ""So it's out there on bare rock, bare land. It's going to melt faster.""Still, Goode said, reseeding isn't necessary if people steward the land. Although the soil might be scorched several inches deep, there are seed pods underneath the burned portion, he said. Indigenous people used to poke holes in the earth to allow these seeds to sprout, but forest policies now forbid this, he said.He said that while oaks and chaparral tend to resprout relatively quickly, conifers take three to five years to begin regrowing. So there often needs to be a burn a couple of years after a wildfire to cull the shrubs and give conifers the opportunity to come back.""I always say to my people when I'm working out there that what we do for Mother Nature is we give her a pedicure, a manicure; we even try to clean her up a little bit,"" he said. ""But she's going to the ball in the springtime; she's going to put on her own dress.

Operating earnings, which ... [+] remove the distortion from market changes and better reflect the firm’s earnings power, rose sharply for the quarter. — (Photo by: Lacy O'Toole/CNBC/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) reported a loss of $12.8 billion in the third quarter versus a loss of $2.8 billion in the same quarter of 2022. Since results are heavily impacted by gains or losses from the investment portfolio, with unrealized losses from their portfolio included in earnings, the decline in the stock market made earnings reported earnings swoon. Operating earnings, which remove the distortion from market changes and better reflect the firm’s earnings power, rose 41% for the quarter versus 2022. Providing an illustration of the value from share repurchases, per-share operating income for the quarter increased by 43% compared to 2022. Berkshire Hathaway 3Q 2023 Earnings Because the pandemic negatively impacted most businesses, including Berkshire, beginning in early 2020, comparing current results to pre-pandemic 2019 results is helpful. Year-to-date operating earnings for the third quarter of 2023 are 46% above 2019. Operating earnings increased over 2019 across all primary business segments except railroad and energy. Thanks to share repurchases, operating earnings per share for year-to-date 2023 were a whopping 65% above 2019. Berkshire Hathaway 3Q Year-To-Date 2023 Earnings A further look into the different operating segments for the third quarter of 2023 shows weaker results than in 2022, aside from the manufacturing, service, and retailing division and the insurance business, despite overall operating income increasing by 41% year-over-year. In a distinct change from 2022, the insurance segment has been the growth driver year-to-date, as operating income rose 165%, but excluding insurance fell by 12%. Berkshire Hathaway 3Q 2023: Operating Earnings by Segment Insurance: Third quarter 2023 investment income was 75% higher than in 2022, primarily due to higher interest income from short-term investments. As yields have rebounded from the ultra-low interest rates implemented in response to the pandemic, investment income has recovered from depressed levels. Due to easy comparisons, investment income should continue improving for the remainder of 2023, even though the Federal Reserve has paused its rate increases. Underwriting results were poor for the third quarter of 2022, with underwriting losses at all three insurance groups, but the most prominent coming from GEICO. Hurricane Ian contributed to the underwriting losses in the third quarter of last year. Unlike GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group had underwriting gains for 2022. In the third quarter, Berkshire’s insurance underwriting suffered no significant catastrophe events, defined as losses exceeding $150 million, and all three insurance units posted underwriting profits. GEICO had a solid third quarter thanks to increased premiums per auto policy and lower claims frequency. GEICO continues to suffer from rising claims severity due in part to the higher valuation of used vehicles. Despite the better results helped by higher average premiums, policies in force at GEICO have declined. A considerable reduction in advertising expenses bolstered profits. At the annual meeting earlier in the year, Ajit Jain, who oversees Berkshire’s insurance businesses, stated that GEICO had made “rapid strides” in telematics, which should help bolster underwriting profits over time. However, the company was still a ”work in progress.” Previously, GEICO was a growth engine for both profits and float, so progress in returning the company to its former glory should be watched closely. The two most essential concepts in insurance investing are “float” and underwriting profit. In simple terms, float is created for insurance companies because insurance premiums are paid before any claims are made by the insured. Insurance companies can invest the float, sometimes for years, before insurance losses are reimbursed. Berkshire has a history, unlike many insurance companies, of earning an underwriting profit, meaning that their float costs them nothing and makes them money in addition to allowing them to earn a profit off of investing the float. As seen in the third quarter of 2023, an underwriting profit means the insurance premium exceeds all insurance claims and expenses. Despite Berkshire’s underwriting loss for 2022, it posted underwriting profits year-to-date in 2023 and for calendar years 2021, 2020, and 2019. Berkshire’s float was higher at approximately $167 billion versus the $166 billion level at the end of the second quarter and above the $164 billion on December 31, 2022. In general, the value of float increases as yields rise. Float per share has increased to $115,417 from $114,519 and $112,066 at the end of the first quarter and 2022, respectively. Share repurchases also aided this growth in float per share. Railroad: Berkshire owns one of the largest railroads in North America, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad, operating in the U.S. and Canada. Third-quarter operating earnings fell 15% and declined 17% year-to-date versus 2022. According to Berkshire, “the decreases were primarily attributable to lower overall freight volumes and higher non-fuel operating costs, partially offset by lower fuel costs.” The railroad was a relative underperformer in 2022, but most of the earnings weakness stems from economic rather than company-specific factors in 2023. Earnings are down year-over-year across the railroad industry. Utilities and Energy: Berkshire owns 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (BHE), which generally provides steady and growing earnings, as one would expect from what primarily consists of regulated utilities and pipeline companies. In addition, BHE typically produces significant tax credits due to its wind-powered electricity generation. Third-quarter operating earnings fell 69% and declined 46% year-to-date versus 2022. BHE set aside another $1.3 billion for possible losses from the wildfires involving PacifiCorp. Aside from the higher estimated wildfire liability, the U.S. utilities business looks to be operating as expected. This group also operates Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices (BHHS), the largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the country. The results show that the slowdown in housing activity remains evident, posting an 81.3% decline in year-to-date net earnings versus 2022. The 2023 BHHS earnings have suffered from lower transaction volume, mortgage, and refinance activity due to “the impact of rising interest rates, including lower existing home sales and mortgage refinancing demand.” Manufacturing, Service and Retailing: This segment consists of many diverse businesses, so this analysis will focus on a few significant themes when looking at this segment. Berkshire’s aerospace exposure remains substantial despite selling its publicly traded airline holdings earlier in 2020. Berkshire previously took a $10 billion impairment charge on the Precision Castparts PCP (PCC) business due to its exposure to the COVID-disrupted aerospace industry. PCC’s pre-tax earnings have risen sharply year-to-date at 32.5% over 2022, primarily due to “higher demand for aerospace products, while power/energy and general and industrial products also contributed to the overall revenue increases.” Management reiterated that “long-term forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products.” Still, future growth will rely on increasing production to meet the demand. Berkshire’s FlightSafety and NetJets continued to see a rebound, with year-to-date revenues in the aviation services businesses growing by 11.5% over last year, “primarily due to increases in the number of aircraft in shared aircraft ownership programs and a year-to-date increase in flight hours across NetJets’ various programs, as well as higher average rates.” After a 2022 boom year, housing-related businesses like Clayton Homes, Shaw, Johns Manville, Acme Building Products, Benjamin Moore, and MiTek posted lower quarterly and year-to-date earnings, at 5.6% and 10.8% decreases in pre-tax profits, respectively. The impact of higher home mortgage interest rates on home construction means that “we continue to anticipate certain of our businesses will experience weakening demand and declines in revenues and earnings into 2024.” The most significant portion of the retailing segment is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (BHA), which owns over 80 auto dealerships. BHA had 18.6% higher earnings for year-to-date 2023 compared to 2022, driven by “higher earnings from parts/service/repair and finance/service contract operations and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower vehicle gross profit margin rates and higher floor plan interest expense.” New vehicle sales rose by 11.5% in the first nine months of the year, while used car sales declined by 4.6%. In addition, year-to-date 2023 earnings were lower for the other retailing businesses, which include Pampered Chef and See’s Candies, primarily due to the home furniture retailers, including Nebraska Furniture Mart. The home furnishing businesses have experienced “lower customer traffic,” with a 31.1% decline in earnings through September relative to 2022. Berkshire’s McLane unit had 69.7% higher profits for the third quarter and year-to-date pre-tax earnings 53.2% above 2022. The improvement in earnings “reflects increases in the gross margin rates and lower fuel expenses, partly offset by higher personnel expenses.” McLane is a wholesale distributor to retailers and restaurants. TTI TTI is a distributor of electronic components, and management noted that “since the third quarter of 2022, new orders have slowed in several regions and markets, particularly in the Asia Pacific region, in part attributable to elevated customer inventory levels and increasing price competition.” In another sign of a continued challenging economic backdrop, Berkshire expects the difficult conditions its TTI unit to “persist over the remainder of 2023 and into 2024.” It is not abnormal for distribution businesses to suffer from these issues after a period of supply chain issues and high demand. Pilot Travel Centers: Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North America, under the names Pilot and Flying J. In January 2023, Berkshire acquired an additional 41.4% ownership of Pilot for roughly $8.2 billion. As Berkshire’s ownership increased to 80% of the entity, it is now shown as a segment within the financials for the operating companies. According to management, Pilot’s “revenues and earnings are highly dependent on diesel fuel and gasoline volumes, prices and margins.” Pre-tax earnings fell by 59.5% for the third quarter and 44.3% year-to-date compared with 2022. Pre-tax earnings were hurt by “significantly lower fuel prices, as well as from lower fuel sales volumes,” while operating and interest expenses rose. Non-Controlled Businesses: This segment includes companies’ profits that must be accounted for under the equity method due to the size of ownership and influence on management. The after-tax equity method earnings have Berkshire’s proportionate share of profits attributable to its investments in Kraft Heinz (KHC), Occidental Petroleum OXY (OXY), and Berkadia. According to Bloomberg, Berkshire is Occidental Petroleum’s largest shareholder, with a 25.8% stake. More about the reasons for the Occidental investment is here. Other: The segment had a gain in the quarter primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate gains generated from bonds issued by Berkshire Hathaway and denominated in British Pounds, euros, and Japanese Yen. These foreign currency liabilities are not a concern as Berkshire has significant assets and earnings denominated in these foreign currencies. Investment gains from non-U.S. dollar investments generally offset these losses and vice versa depending on currency exchange rates. Though overwhelmed by the currency gains, there were losses in the segment created by amortizing intangible assets connected to companies purchased by Berkshire. Finally, other earnings include “Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses.” Berkshire bought back almost $1.1 billion of its stock in the third quarter, down from $1.4 billion in the second quarter. Until an announcement in mid-2018, Berkshire had only made repurchases when the stock traded at less than 1.2 times the price-to-book (P/B) ratio. While that constraint is now relaxed, it is still a good indicator of the general range when aggressive repurchases will likely be seen. Berkshire’s price-to-book ratio was between 1.3 and almost 1.5 times during the quarter. Berkshire only intends to repurchase shares when the “repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined.” The price-to-book ratio remains a reasonable proxy for gauging Berkshire’s intrinsic value. Berkshire increased the pace of buybacks in September as the stock fell and valuation improved. Still, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger’s judgment about its intrinsic value versus other available uses of capital can differ from that simple price-to-book measure. Berkshire Hathaway Valuation In addition, Berkshire made other purchases but was a net seller of publicly traded stocks in the third quarter. Berkshire bought $1.7 billion of stocks while selling almost $7 billion for a net decreased investment of nearly $5.3 billion in publicly traded equities. A close review of the firm’s 10Q filing revealed that approximately $2 billion of Berkshire’s Chevron (CVX) holding was sold during the quarter. More details will be found in Berkshire’s 13F filing with the SEC, released in mid-November. Berkshire Hathaway initially announced the acquisition of about 5% of five Japanese trading companies at the end of August 2020. These holdings are Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co. Ltd., and Sumitomo Corp. Buffett revealed in April 2023 that Berkshire increased its stakes in these companies to 7.4%. Buffett indicated that these were intended to be long-term holdings, and Berkshire may still increase its stake to 9.9%. The 13F does not include international stocks. Summary: Quarterly results are generally not meaningful for Berkshire since it is managed with a focus on increasing long-term value and not meeting quarterly hurdles. This ability to take advantage of time arbitrage has served the company and shareholders well over the years. The goal in looking at the results is to see if the segments are generally operating as expected and consider the capital allocation decisions made by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. In addition, reported earnings, which include realized and unrealized gains and losses, can obscure the true earnings power of the company. While net earnings were reported at a $12.8 billion loss, operating earnings for the third quarter were $10.8 billion, rose by 41% over 2022, and are 33% above pre-pandemic 2019 levels. In recent years, a significant capital allocation decision was made to increase share repurchases. This activity signals that Buffett and Munger believe Berkshire Hathaway’s price is below their intrinsic value estimate, which should be a value-creator for the remaining shareholders. Operating earnings per share were 43% above 2022 and 50% above 2019, with the additional benefit from share repurchases. Despite the solid operating earnings growth, Berkshire was not immune to the macroeconomic challenges. Berkshire’s third-quarter operating earnings, excluding the insurance segment, declined by 20% compared to the same quarter in 2022. As noted previously, weakness in railroad volumes and Berkshire’s significant exposure to residential housing have weighed on earnings outside of insurance. In addition, the utilities segment’s earnings were dented by the likely liability from wildfires. In addition, profit margins, excluding the insurance business, were down over three percentage points versus last year. So far, Buffett’s prediction at the annual meeting that most Berkshire businesses will likely have lower earnings in 2023 than the previous year has been correct. Despite the expectation that most of Berkshire’s businesses would do worse, Buffett forecasted higher 2023 overall operating earnings at the annual meeting. Buffett noted that insurance underwriting does not “correlate with economic activity.” Higher bond yields have provided significantly higher investment income for Berkshire’s insurance business in 2023, growing 75% year-over-year. With the tailwind from the insurance segment, Berkshire’s third quarter and year-to-date operating earnings growth has materially outpaced the S&P 500. Berkshire Hathaway 3Q Year-To-Date 2023: Pre-Tax Margin by Operating Segment Berkshire’s stock price outperformed the S&P 500 in the third quarter, rising by 2.6% versus a total return of -3.3% from the S&P 500. For 2023 through the end of October, Berkshire’s price is 10.5% higher, while the S&P 500 had a total return of 10.7%. Cash levels were $10 billion above last quarter. Berkshire retains a fortress balance sheet with cash and equivalents of almost $152 billion, providing flexibility to take advantage of opportunities, including repurchasing its stock. Berkshire has stated that there would be no stock repurchases if it would cause cash levels to fall below $30 billion. Despite the advanced age of its two top leaders, Warren Buffett, CEO and Chairman, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman, Berkshire has a solid bench to continue managing the firm. Greg Abel manages the non-insurance business and is the architect of Berkshire Hathway Energy. Ajit Jain manages the insurance businesses and will continue to do so. Ted Weschler and Todd Combs already manage a portion of Berkshire’s publicly traded stock portfolio, among other duties. Berkshire is managed to survive and emerge stronger from any economic or market downturn, and that philosophy is not likely to change, given the culture. Buffett’s statement that Berkshire “will buy $50 billion of our stock if it makes sense” should comfort those worried about the stock dropping sharply when Buffett and Munger depart the firm. Berkshire expanded the cash hoard on its Fort Knox balance sheet, allowing the unique ability to take advantage of investment opportunities in any downturn while virtually eliminating the risk of ruin. Despite the headline loss due to stock market weakness, Berkshire’s robust third-quarter operating results again illustrated the value of its diversified business mix. The insurance business more than offset the earnings weakness in many other business units."

For example, in May, State Farm, the largest home insurer in the state, announced it wouldpause issuing policiesin California, citing wildfire risks. That came after Allstate stopped issuing policies in the state. Farmers Insurance deemed it too risky to continue insuring homes in Florida andpulled out of the marketthere entirely. “With many carriers pulling out, that leaves other companies underwriting these really expensive policies,” said Monaghan. “Policies that cost $10,000 for a year? That is impossible for some buyers who have to pay that all at once [along] with their closing costs.” In Maui and across America, climate change and extreme weather are hurting housing affordability To help a deal close, Monaghan said some motivated sellers have given two years’ worth of insurance costs to the buyer. But even if a buyer can pay their insurance costs up front (or even has them paid by the seller), buyers still have backed out of deals, worried thattheir insurance premiums will go up in the years to come. He said buyers wonder, “Will [they] be able to afford it next year? Will their policy be canceled? Then, if they can’t get another insurer, their loan gets called. It is a never-ending death spiral.” As the closing day came for his clients’ home in Bayside, it became clear the buyers had not secured insurance. Monaghanbegan calling around to help. The most affordable option he could find was $6,348 for the year. The average cost for homeowners’ insurance in the United States is about $1,820, according to an analysis by NerdWallet, but there are many variables. Ultimately, the buyers walked away. The costly policy andthe potential of rising insurance costs in years to comekilled the deal. Now, the home is back on the market. But with insurance coverage so hard to find, it’s listed for $25,000 less. “It is a very bad situation,” said Monaghan. “What insurers say goes. Even if they have flawed maps or are relying on third-party information. They think it is going to get a lot worse over time.” According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the number and severity of storms are already getting worse. America’s frozen housing market: Sales hit a 13-year low As of October 10, there have been 24 weather and climate disasterswith losses exceeding $1 billion in the United States this year, according to NOAA. These included a drought, two floods, 18 severe storms, one tropical cyclone, one wildfire, and one winter storm. Overall, these events resulted in the deaths of 373 people and had significant economic effects. By comparison, between 1980 and 2022, the typical annual average for events like this was eight. For the most recent five years, theannual average has been 18 events. As climate risks continue, a standoff has developed over who should pay the cost of insuring homes against ever-growing risks. As insurance becomes scarce in some areas and its cost surges, homebuyers are walking away from deals more often than in the past, said Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a personal insurance consumer advocacy group based in San Francisco. Although, she added, this is where the industry has been heading for some time now. “Florida and Louisiana have been having extreme property insurance drama for a while, starting from Hurricane Andrew in 1992, thenHurricane Katrina in 2005,” Bach said. “The severity of the storms and the price tag of the repairs started to get insurers’ attention.” Bach said that in places like Louisiana, insurers were shown the large-scale risk mitigations put in place in the face of more frequent and harsher storms, such as stronger levees. More remote workers are willing to move in order to find affordable housing “But I don’t think they are there yet,” she said. “Insurers are not yet accepting the value of risk reduction. They aren’t able to reduce prices, they aren’t willing to have it impact their underwriting. That is where the heart of the fight lies now.” In the meantime, she said, on top of climate change,other issues are also pushing the risk and cost even higher. “This isn’t just climate change, it is climate-change-plus,” Bach said. It is climate change, plus the Covid hangover pushing costs up,plus inflation, plus technology that allows insurers to evaluate risks in a wider array of ways. Her organization, whose main focus was once helping those impacted by disaster to recover money from insurance companies, is now primarily devoted to working on insurance availability and affordability issues. “It has evolved from a very regional crisis impacting few areas to a much bigger crisis,” said Bach. “We didn’t want to use the word ‘crisis,’ but if you talk to the homeowners in WUI [wildland urban interface] areas they would say it is a crisis.” Still, Bach said, it is important to keep the crisis in perspective. In California, for example, the share ofhomeowners using FAIR plan— the insurer of last resort made up of a syndicated fire insurance pool comprised of all insurers licensed to issue property and casualty in the state — remains under 5%, according to the California Department of Insurance. While insurers have always dropped out of markets or changed their conditions in reaction to a policy, Bach said a competitor would always move in. “Competition would, in fact, heal the wound,” she said. “But that isn’t happening now.” “We are in a world in which natural disasters are more common and more severe, and we are in a state with diverse housing,” said Jennifer Branchini, a Compass agent in Pleasanton and president of the California Association of Realtors. “It is this insurance expense that everyone is now concerned about. Yes, it is expensive to rebuild. What is that doing to the market when it is being put on the homeowner or the person who would like to purchase the house?” In a recent survey of CAR members, only 7% of agents said they had deals fall through. But of those, a whopping 61% said the deal fell through because insurance was not available to the client. An additional 19% fell through because the premium was too expensive. And it isn’t just the lower- or mid-priced homes. Home affordability is the worst it has been since 1984 Branchini heard from a California agent who represented a buyer in the purchase of an $8.2 million property. “The only insurance they could get was through State Farm for $210,000 a year,” she said. “Three days later, State Farm paused new coverage. They lost that insurance. That buyer walked away.” The affordability and availability of insurance is one more thing in the perfect storm of thecurrent rough housing market,said Branchini. “Buyers are facing high interest rates,” she said. “There is already a lack of availability and lack of affordability. And for many of the properties that are on the market you can’t obtain insurance? Or it is very unaffordable insurance?” She remains hopeful that competition and creativity will help the housing market. “We’ll have to see some creative solutions in the near term to create that competitive marketplace for insurance,” she said."

After the fire, sh… [+6145 chars]",Climate,"SAN FRANCISCO --Heidi Lange was among the first to rebuild after the deadliest wildfire in California history destroyed her home in 2018 along with much of the town of Paradise. After the fire, she got divorced, which left her with only half the money paid out by insurance — but she budgeted, planned ahead and even paid extra for stucco siding and a metal roof to make her new house more resistant to fire. She thought the hard part was over. So the office manager was stunned to learn nearly four years living in the same home, this month the annual premium on her home insurance would rise dramatically — from $1,200 to $9,750. “To see we’ve come so far, only to have the legs kicked out from under us,” she said. “This is so crazy to me. How is this the biggest thing we’re dealing with?” The soaring cost of home insurance has consumed the town of Paradise, residents and officials say, as it prepares to commemorate the five-year anniversary of the Nov. 8, 2018, Camp Fire. Residents have received annual premiums that near or exceed $10,000 — leaving many to wonder how they're supposed to rebuild their hard-hit community when insurance is so shockingly high for houses in an area that is supposed to be among the most affordable in California. The wildfire that ripped through Paradise and surrounding areas, killing 85, sounded an alarm to national home insurers about the costs of wildfires fueled by climate change. Seven of the 12 top home-insurers in California — including Farmers Insurance, State Farm, Allstate — have paused or restricted new business in California, saying they can’t afford to take on new clients. California’s Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara is trying to step in to reform the system and to make the private market more robust, but the bulk of the changes won’t take effect for at least another year. Neither the state Insurance Department nor a major industry lobbying group could explain the sharp price increases five years after the fire, when so many steps have been taken to protect the community against future wildfires, including initiatives to bury power lines, and clear brush and trees away from buildings. The state did not have data on the average premium increase for the town. Michael Soller, spokesperson for the Insurance Department, said premiums depend on a number of factors, including the cost of rebuilding, increased coverage or decreased deductibles as well as rate increases approved by the state. He said private insurers should be able to offer discounts for community fire-hardening efforts sometime early next year, but the risk of wildfire still exists in Paradise. Farmers Insurance was cited by several residents as the company that raised their premiums, but residents also said they couldn’t find other insurers offering more affordable policies. Farmers declined an interview request. “Homeowners insurance rates are determined using a number of different variables, including historical loss data, loss trends, age and construction-type of structures, etc. These and other factors, combined with inflation adjustments, are reflected in customer rates,” the company said in a statement. Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, said insurers lost more than two decades’ worth of profits from the wildfires of 2017 and 2018, and people may have to pay more to live in wildland areas. Carl Johnsen, a retired drywall contractor, has lived in the same house since 1979, when he moved to Paradise. It survived the 2018 fire but his previous insurer dropped him, and he received a new quote of over $14,000 that he’s not inclined to pay, he said. Johnsen doesn’t feel good about going without fire and liability coverage, but feels he has little choice. “I guess I’d rather do that and have a place to live, unless it burns down,"" he said of forgoing insurance. “I gotta have money to buy food ... and pay taxes.” Gene Robinson, 61, and his wife purchased a new home in Paradise with the insurance proceeds from the house that burned in the Camp Fire. This year, the insurance premium offered by Farmers on their four-bedroom, three-bath home soared from $2,800 to $9,550. The couple opted for basic fire coverage through California's insurer of last resort, which is quickly becoming the only option left for people in Paradise. The Robinsons are paying $4,500 through the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, and $750 with another insurer for supplemental liability coverage. “It’s a beautiful home, but it really makes you think about staying in the state,” said Robinson, a retiree. The FAIR Plan is averaging 1,000 new applications a weekday from homeowners unable to find affordable home insurance in the private market. As of September, it had written more than 330,000 policies — up from nearly 273,000 plans last year and 127,000 in 2018. Lara, the insurance commissioner, wants to allow insurance companies to consider climate change when setting their rates, but only if they write more policies for households that live in areas threatened by wildfire. The state is also moving to allow insurers to make discounts available for homeowners who take certain measures, such as installing roofs that are fire-resistant rated and upgrading to multi-paned windows, said Soller, the department spokesperson. He said home insurance premiums in California increased about 35% on average between 2017 and 2022, driven by historic wildfire losses, but are still lower than other large states with major climate risks, including Louisiana, Texas and Florida. Kathy Ehrhart, a litigator in Chicago who focuses on the insurance industry, applauds California's efforts to persuade insurance companies to stay in the state, because that should eventually promote competition and stability. “Unfortunately for the homeowner today paying their bill,” she says, “that takes some time.” Lange, a lifelong resident of the area, is frustrated that elected officials and insurance companies can’t figure out a fix. She may have to go through the state to insure her home, although that will still cost $7,300. She considered leaving Paradise after the fire. “But this is where my friends and my family and my church and my work — it’s where my village is,” she said, breaking down in tears. “And I just wasn’t going to let that be taken away.”"

After the fire, she got divorced, which left her with only half the money paid out by insurance — but she budgeted, planned ahead and even paid extra for stucco siding and a metal roof to make her new house more resistant to fire. She thought the hard part was over. So the office manager was stunned to learn nearly four years living in the same home, this month the annual premium on her home insurance would rise dramatically — from $1,200 to $9,750. “To see we’ve come so far, only to have the legs kicked out from under us,” she said. “This is so crazy to me. How is this the biggest thing we’re dealing with?” The soaring cost of home insurance has consumed the town of Paradise, residents and officials say, as it prepares to commemorate the five-year anniversary of the Nov. 8, 2018, Camp Fire. Residents have received annual premiums that near or exceed $10,000 — leaving many to wonder how they're supposed to rebuild their hard-hit community when insurance is so shockingly high for houses in an area that is supposed to be among the most affordable in California. The wildfire that ripped through Paradise and surrounding areas, killing 85, sounded an alarm to national home insurers about the costs of wildfires fueled by climate change. Seven of the 12 top home-insurers in California — including Farmers Insurance, State Farm, Allstate — have paused or restricted new business in California, saying they can’t afford to take on new clients. California’s Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara is trying to step in to reform the system and to make the private market more robust, but the bulk of the changes won’t take effect for at least another year. Neither the state Insurance Department nor a major industry lobbying group could explain the sharp price increases five years after the fire, when so many steps have been taken to protect the community against future wildfires, including initiatives to bury power lines, and clear brush and trees away from buildings. The state did not have data on the average premium increase for the town. Michael Soller, spokesperson for the Insurance Department, said premiums depend on a number of factors, including the cost of rebuilding, increased coverage or decreased deductibles as well as rate increases approved by the state. He said private insurers should be able to offer discounts for community fire-hardening efforts sometime early next year, but the risk of wildfire still exists in Paradise. Farmers Insurance was cited by several residents as the company that raised their premiums, but residents also said they couldn’t find other insurers offering more affordable policies. Farmers declined an interview request. “Homeowners insurance rates are determined using a number of different variables, including historical loss data, loss trends, age and construction-type of structures, etc. These and other factors, combined with inflation adjustments, are reflected in customer rates,” the company said in a statement.

By that time on Nov. 8, 2018, the sky was black even though the sun had been up for hours. Both sides of the street were on fire as Nordgren grabbed the woman's hand. “Have you lived a good life?” she asked. The woman said she had. “So have I,” said Nordgren, the president of the Paradise Lutheran Church council. “We're going to say the Our Father and we're going to drive like hell.” Nordgren has told that story countless times in the five years since the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California's history nearly erased a quiet community in the Sierra Nevada foothills. There are thousands more stories like it, each one providing a frame for one of the worst wildfires in U.S. history. Five years later, some — like Nordgren — are sharing their stories freely and managing their post-traumatic stress enough to return to Paradise to help make something new. Others, like Shari Bernacette, are still haunted by their memories — including witnessing the flames consume a fleeing couple, one pushing the other in a wheelchair. “We still can't sleep well. We toss and turn all night,” said Bernacette, who moved with her husband to Yuma, Arizona, to escape the risk of future wildfires. The couple lives in a used RV purchased with their insurance money. “We are in the desert surrounded by cactus and rocks. There is nothing that can light up. We will never live amongst the trees again."" For people who returned to Paradise, life is about adjusting. It’s the same place, but doesn't feel the same. Paradise was once so thick with trees it was hard to tell the town was perched on a ridge. Now, the shadows are gone as sunlight bathes the town on clear days, offering impressive views of the canyons. Today’s population of just under 10,000 is less than half the 26,000 who lived there before the blaze. The Camp Fire destroyed about 11,000 homes, which amounted to about 90% of the town's structures. So far 2,500 homes have been rebuilt. About 700 are under construction at any one time, many on original lots. But just six of the town's 36 mobile home parks that served mostly low-income and older residents have reopened. Donna Hooton and her husband lived in one of the mobile home parks destroyed by the fire. The Hootons live off of Social Security and said they can’t afford to move to Paradise. They now live an hour away, in a small, decades-old mobile home. “We wish we could go home but home is not there anymore,” Hooton said. Paradise Mayor Greg Bolin says that by 2025 all of the town's overhead power lines will be buried underground. By 2026, he says all public roads will be repaved. “I can see what it’s going to look like. I know how nice it is going to be when it’s done,” said Bolin, who also owns Trilogy Construction Inc., one of the town's main construction companies. For the most part, Bolin said it is “amazing, in five years, how well people are doing."" But then a whiff of smoke will linger in the air, and it instantly brings residents back to that terrible day. It happened just last month, when Derrick Harlan — a 34-year-old Paradise resident whose business reduces fire hazards — got a permit to burn some debris piles in Paradise. When neighbors saw smoke from the debris fire though, they called the police. The next day, the fire department showed up. “That's where the trauma and the PTSD comes in,"" Harlan said. Wildfires have always been a part of life in California, but they are getting more severe as climate change has caused hotter, drier summers. Seven of the state's top 10 most destructive fires happened in the past decade. Before the Camp Fire killed 85 people, the state’s deadliest was a 1933 blaze that killed 29. More recently, a 2017 fire shocked the state as it ripped through suburban neighborhoods in California wine country, killing 22. But the Camp Fire, the official name of the Paradise fire, marked a turning point. Now, utility companies routinely shut off power for millions of people during wind storms in an effort to prevent fires from starting. Major property insurance companies have raised homeowners' rates to exponential highs or dropped coverage for many in wildfire-prone areas. Other providers have simply stopped writing new policies altogether. PG&E pleaded guilty to 84 counts of manslaughter, filed for bankruptcy and announced plans to bury 10,000 miles of power lines. The town has installed warning sirens and is working to create more evacuation routes. But just when it seemed safe to think that what happened in Paradise was a once-in-a-lifetime fire, it happened again — this time thousands of miles away in Maui, Hawaii. It meant April Kelly, who grew up in Paradise and lived in Maui for 16 years, lost both of her hometowns. “I can’t believe I’m going through this a second time,” she said. Finding ways to cope with that grief has become a shared part of life in Paradise. The local theater saved Judy Clemens, giving her a space to channel her passion for live performance after the blaze. The Theatre on the Ridge opened to host its first show on Valentine's Day in 2019. “If the theater had gone, too, I really would have been lost,” Clemens said. For Samuel Walker, making peace with the fire meant making peace with God. The pastor of the First Baptist Church of Paradise was wracked with guilt over the death of Bob Quinn, a church member who Walker likened to a second father. On the day of the fire, Walker drove by the street where Quinn lived and for a moment, thought about checking on him. Instead, he rescued his parents, who would not have been able to escape the fire on their own. Walker learned of Quinn's death three days after the fire, while he was in Fresno with his family. Thieves had just broken into Walker's car and stolen the only things his wife and daughter had saved from their house — including photos, an iPad and a knitting machine. He was angry about his situation, everything that had happened and all of the people who had died or been hurt. For a pastor, being mad at God is a bigger problem than most. “How am I going to minister to a congregation with all of these people with all of their issues, if I'm still trying to get through mine?” Walker asked. He finally found peace after a trip to the hospital, of all places. Walker injured his arm after a fall while taking out the trash. In the hospital, he immediately thought of a Bible verse from the New Testament that says: “The Lord disciplines everyone he loves.” “It was almost kind of a healing point ... to say, ‘OK Lord, I’m going to let this go. I’m going to stop being angry and get back to what you have me here to do,’” Walker said. Businesses are returning to Paradise, with recent openings of a Big Lots and Ross Dress for Less sending ripples of excitement through town. Town leaders plan to begin installing a sewer system next summer for the business district, which would allow more restaurants to operate. That will help Nicki Jones' restaurant, a deli and wine bar called Nic's. Jones first came to Paradise 25 years ago. She called it a “fluke,” a place to retire with her husband. The town quickly became much more than that. She opened two businesses: a candle shop and a women’s clothing store. Both burned in the fire, along with her home. After the fire, there was no time for rest or reflection. She had a community to rebuild. With a background in accounting she knew what to do. She started by calling her insurance companies. Within 30 days of the fire, she was able to buy a building. Within a year, she opened a restaurant called Nic’s, what she said is the first new business to open in Paradise after the fire. “Everybody reacts to whatever tragedy there is — and we all have them — but my way has always been to jump in. How can I fix it?” she said. “I wanted a place where everybody could come and feel comfortable and feel normal.” The best time to go to Nic’s is for “Wine room Wednesdays,” when lots of locals stop by for a drink and a hug. That sometimes includes Adam Thompson, who is not from Paradise. After the pandemic, Thompson and his family were looking for a quiet community in the foothills to raise their family. In 2021, they moved to Magalia, just outside of Paradise. If the town is to grow, it needs new people. But newcomers face a daunting question: How do you assimilate into a community defined by a shared tragedy? Thompson said his family was quickly accepted. His kids are enrolled in a local school. They play Little League baseball and perform in the local theater. “There’s a humility and a resilience here that I don’t think would be in a town like this had they not gone through the fire,” he said. “I’ve never once felt excluded up here. I’ve never felt judged. I’ve only felt love and welcome from literally every single person I’ve met.” April Kelly, who hails from Paradise and Maui, is now the general manager at Nic’s. She is on the board of directors for a parent support group called Mom’s on the Ridge. Samuel Walker is still the pastor of Paradise Baptist Church, now living with his family in nearby Magalia. Before the fire, Paradise was viewed as a retirement community with mostly older residents. But that’s changing. The Paradise Little League has had so much interest it's warned parents that kids may be turned away next year. The town's rebirth has amazed Don Criswell, a Paradise native who moved back to the area in 1998. Wildfires burned his property in 2008 and again in 2018. Both times he stayed to fight the fires himself. The Paradise of his memory has been erased. Personal landmarks — the house he grew up in, his elementary school — are gone. Most of his childhood friends and neighbors have since moved away. But he hasn't gone anywhere. Instead, he has planted trees and a garden. He donates vegetables to a free community lunch put on by his church. He even plays the piano for people who come to eat. “I'm so sorry that it (the fire) happened. There’s nothing I can do about that,"" he said. “I can try to make it a good, fun and beautiful place to live again. I think we’re doing that.” ___ Rodriguez reported from San Francisco."

The increased global temperatures this year are linked to man-made emissions, scientists say, as well as the naturally-occurring El Nino weather system, which warms surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. CS3 said in a statement that 2023 is“virtually certain”to break the previous record set in 2016, which was also an El Nino year. The only other time on record in which global surface air temperatures exceeded expectations by such a large margin was September 2023. Researchers have indicated that extreme temperatures are expected to persist in 2024. “When we combine our data with the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), we can say that this is the warmest year for the last 125,000 years,”Burgess said, adding that she was“really, really surprised”by the findings. The uptick in global temperatures directly corresponds to an increase in human suffering, according to Dr. Friederike Otto from Imperial College London. “Within this year, extreme heatwaves and droughts, made much worse by these extreme temperatures, have caused thousands of deaths, people losing their livelihoods, being displaced, etc.”he said, as per the BBC on Wednesday.“These are the records that matter.” Scientists have blamed man-made climate change for a series of disasters which have happened throughout 2023, including floods that killed thousands in Libya, South American heatwaves and Canada’s worst-ever season of forest fires - which Piers Foster, a climate scientist at the UK’s University of Leeds, warned could become commonplace. “We must not let the devastating floods, wildfires, storms, and heatwaves seen this year become a new normal,”he said via Reuters, explaining that by“rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions”the rate of warming can be halved. The topic is expected to dominate the UN’s COP28 climate change summit, set to begin in Dubai on November 30."

The Chugach is the second-largest at just under 7 million acres.Not only are they the biggest national forests, they are the most intact, Law said, and provide habitat for iconic, keystone species such as thebald eagle, brown bear and gray wolf.""Those forests are also cool and wet, with carbon stocks that are only minimally affected by wildfire, stocks that are likely to increase as the climate changes,"" she said. ""Protecting the Tongass and Chugach is a high priority if we want to have a chance to attain global goals relating to climate and diversity of species.""Law and collaborators in the College of Forestry teamed up with researchers at Southern Oregon University, the Woodwell Climate Research Center and EcoSpatial Services L.L.C. to look at 152 national forests and compare them in terms of carbon density and accumulation, total biomass carbon stocks, habitat for eagles, bears and wolves, and landscape integrity—defined as degree of modification by humans.The authors report that almost 31% of all high-landscape-integrity area found in national forests—areas with minimal or no human modification—is in the Tongass and Chugach, at 25.3% and 5.6%, respectively.Those forests also combine to account for nearly half of all bald eagle habitat available in national forests, 37% ofbrown bearhabitat and 18% ofgray wolfhabitat—no other location has more than 4% of the total wolf habitat found in the U.S. inventory of national forests. All three species were once widespread and abundant across much of North America.""Forests play an incredibly important part in trying to mitigate climate change and support biodiversity,"" Law said. ""For six decades, ecosystems on land have annually been removing roughly 30% of all the carbon dioxide humans have been putting into the atmosphere, and forests do most of that work. But intact forests with high carbon density and high biodiversity are disappearing at a frightening pace, lost to agriculture, logging and other industries, and development.""In addition to sequestering carbon and providing wildlife habitat, intact forests provide a range of ecosystem services, including helping to keep water clean, the authors note. And in the quest to establish nature-basedclimatesolutions,public landshave outsized importance because they are more likely thanprivate landsto afford more stable carbon storage.Still, at present, federal forest lands are caught up in a numbers game, and conservation has some ground to make up on the scoreboard, Law said.""National forests account for 76% of all federalforestland, but logging and other industrial activities are allowed throughout most of that, with only about 19% classified as reserved in one way or another from timber production,"" she said. ""That means there is a substantial gap between current preservation and the preservation targets for protecting biodiversity and carbon stocks.""Ramping up protection in the Alaskan forests offers a big opportunity for closing that gap, the authors point out. Right now, 35% of the Tongass is protected at the two highest levels as categorized by the U.S. Geological Survey and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and 57.6% of the Chugach.""Those two forests have historically been wetter and cooler than most national forests, and over the next 100 years they are projected to have much larger increases in precipitation and much lower increases in maximum temperatures,"" Law said. ""Combined with a relatively low occurrence of wildfire, that makes preserving these forests in their intact state highly possible—if there is the political will to take bold action.""William Ripple and Christopher Wolf of the OSU College of Forestry contributed to this research, which was co-led by Logan Berner of EcoSpatial Services. Berner earned a Ph.D. under Law at Oregon State."

This year is ""virtually certain"" to be the warmest in 125,000 years, European Union scientists said on Wednesday, after data showed last month was the world's hottest October in that period. Last month smashed through the previous October temperature record, from 2019, by a massive margin, the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said. ""The record was broken by 0.4 degrees Celsius, which is a huge margin,"" said C3S Deputy Director Samantha Burgess , who described the October temperature anomaly as ""very extreme"". The heat is a result of continued greenhouse gas emissions from human activity, combined with the emergence this year of the El Nino weather pattern, which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Globally, the average surface air temperature in October was 1.7 degrees Celsius warmer than the same month in 1850-1900, which Copernicus defines as the pre-industrial period. The record-breaking October means 2023 is now ""virtually certain"" to be the warmest year recorded, C3S said in a statement. The previous record was 2016 - another El Nino year. Copernicus' dataset goes back to 1940. ""When we combine our data with the IPCC, then we can say that this is the warmest year for the last 125,000 years,"" Burgess said. The longer-term data from U.N. climate science panel IPCC includes readings from sources such as ice cores, tree rings and coral deposits. The only other time before October a month breached the temperature record by such a large margin was in September 2023. ""September really, really surprised us. So after last month, it's hard to determine whether we're in a new climate state. But now records keep tumbling and they're surprising me less than they did a month ago,"" Burgess said. Michael Mann, a climate scientist at University of Pennsylvania, said: ""Most El Nino years are now record-breakers, because the extra global warmth of El Nino adds to the steady ramp of human-caused warming."" Climate change is fuelling increasingly destructive extremes. This year, that included floods that killed thousands of people in Libya, severe heatwaves in South America, and Canada's worst wildfire season on record.

Last month smashed through the previous October temperature record, from 2019, by a massive margin, the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said. ""The record was broken by 0.4 degrees Celsius, which is a huge margin,"" said C3S Deputy Director Samantha Burgess , who described the October temperature anomaly as ""very extreme"". The heat is a result of continued greenhouse gas emissions from human activity, combined with the emergence this year of the El Nino weather pattern, which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Globally, the average surface air temperature in October was 1.7 degrees Celsius warmer than the same month in 1850-1900, which Copernicus defines as the pre-industrial period. The record-breaking October means 2023 is now ""virtually certain"" to be the warmest year recorded, C3S said in a statement. The previous record was 2016 - another El Nino year. Copernicus' dataset goes back to 1940. ""When we combine our data with the IPCC, then we can say that this is the warmest year for the last 125,000 years,"" Burgess said. The longer-term data from U.N. climate science panel IPCC includes readings from sources such as ice cores, tree rings and coral deposits. The only other time before October a month breached the temperature record by such a large margin was in September 2023. ""September really, really surprised us. So after last month, it's hard to determine whether we're in a new climate state. But now records keep tumbling and they're surprising me less than they did a month ago,"" Burgess said. Michael Mann , a climate scientist at University of Pennsylvania, said: ""Most El Nino years are now record-breakers, because the extra global warmth of El Nino adds to the steady ramp of human-caused warming."" Climate change is fuelling increasingly destructive extremes. This year, that included floods that killed thousands of people in Libya, severe heatwaves in South America, and Canada's worst wildfire season on record.

DND/CAF manages an extensive portfolio of real estate, air, land and maritime fleets required for the defence of Canada. The DND/CAF Climate Resilience and Environmental Sustainability Science and Technology (CRESST) Strategy outlines how DND/CAF's science and technology activities will be guided toward achieving our environmental and energy targets, and anticipating and mitigating the impacts of climate change, so that DND/CAF can continue to protect Canadians. The CRESST Strategy guides science and technology activities through 10 action areas organized under three strategic objectives: Outcomes are divided into short term (one to five years), medium term (five to 10 years) and long term (10+ years). Our institution believes strongly in the importance of innovation to help us meet our climate-related commitments. DND/CAF will review the CRESST Strategy periodically to ensure that it remains fit-for-purpose, and up to date. Like all federal institutions, National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces have an important role to play in achieving federal emissions targets. Meeting our climate commitments will help fight climate change, and protect the safety and security of Canadians, who are seeing the impacts of climate change in the form of forest fires, floods, hurricanes and more. ""The Canadian Armed Forces have been on the front lines of the fight against climate change, by responding to forest fires, floods, and emergencies across Canada. It is crucial that National Defence takes measures to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and environmental footprint, in order to mitigate the security threat posed by climate change. By ensuring that DND/CAF's science, technology and innovation activities directly address climate change and environmental impacts, we are helping to ensure the safety of Canadians."" The Honourable Bill Blair, Minister of National Defence The CRESST strategy builds on existing DND/CAF efforts including theDefence Energy and Environment Strategy. National Defence has a target of reducing our GHG emissions by 40 percent by 2025, five years ahead of schedule, which will contribute to the federal government's target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Energy Performance Contract projects have been completed in Greenwood, Esquimalt, Petawawa, and more. EPC projects are underway at Comox, Borden, Kingston, Shilo, Halifax, Alert, and Bagotville. Similar contracts are in development for additional bases across Canada. Once the EPC projects underway are completed, we expect to reduce our annual energy costs by nearly $20 million per year and reduce our emissions by over 64,000 tonnes annually."

PARADISE, Calif. — Cindy Foudray is trying to stay optimistic. But some days it's a struggle. ""I feel like I've aged like 20 years,"" she says, chuckling wryly. ""It's just a lot of stress and a lot of things have happened."" Her life was completely upended in early November of 2018, amid one of the driest autumns on record in the Sierra Nevada, when the deadlyCamp Fire swept into her hometown of Paradise, Calif., killing 85 people and destroying nearly 19,000 structures — the most expensive climate-related disaster in the world that year. ""There are positives,"" she says. ""My family got out alive."" But Foudray's family home, a two-bedroom two-bath mobile, was a total loss. Five years later, she's still mostly living in an RV on her burned-out lot, hoping to get a new home within the next year. ""My heart goes out to people in Hawaii right now because we can totally relate to that,"" Foudray says. ""I mean, we didn't have to jump in the ocean, but trying to get off this mountain was really difficult during the fire."" As Paradise marks five years since one of the worst wildfires in American history — only the blazes on Maui last August were deadlier — many in the rural Northern California region are still coping with trauma and struggling to recover. The slow and expensive recovery that continues today in Paradisecould be a lesson for survivors in Lahaina, not to mention scores of other recent wildland fire disasters on the mainland likeMarshall Canyon, Colo.,and nearLas Vegas, N.M. Before the Camp Fire, which wasignited by downed powerlinesin the National Forest lands northeast of town, about 26,000 people lived in Paradise. Now, it's estimated that it's roughly a third of its pre-fire population. Depending on who you ask, it's a monumental feat considering 90% of the town was leveled, or it's an example of how a recovery from a major disaster can be prolonged and painfully slow despite billions in federal and state aid. Paradise had been an island of relative affordability in expensive California. It also became dangerously overgrown with dense stands of pines and underbrush, in part due to loose zoning and prior forest management decisions. In the 1950s and 1960s it was marketed as a ""place in the pines"" for retirees from the Bay Area, about a three-hour drive to the south. Foudray is planning to stay in her camper this winter as much as she can. She can stay with family if her pipes freeze, as they did earlier this year. She's grateful to have found steadier work in the meantime as a home services aid. ""It's a slow process either way because when you're starting from scratch, you can only do what you can do at that moment and work forward,"" Foudray says. In the weeks and months immediately after the Camp Fire, survivors were anxious to get home. Theysoon became frustrated, angry about the slow pace of even just removing the fire debris. Then as the months dragged on, thescope of what was aheadbegan to settle in. One million trees have been removed from the Paradise area and many lots are now for sale or being built on.Kirk Siegler/NPRhide caption One million trees have been removed from the Paradise area and many lots are now for sale or being built on. It took nine months just to remove all the hazardous toxins and debris piles before the first homes could be rebuilt. Paradise's recovery had a lot stacked against it from the beginning due to its largely elderly and low-income population. Many were forced to leave in search of affordable housing. ""I don't know that there will ever be 26,000 people in Paradise again,"" says Ryan Miller, a geography and hazards expert at the University of California, Davis who has been interviewing Camp Fire survivors as part of a doctoral project. Miller also grew up in Paradise. His brother, sister and mother narrowly survived evacuating on Nov. 8, 2018. His family lived there because they could afford to. ""I don't think it's up to the Paradises of California to provide the affordable housing anymore,"" Miller says. One of the biggest changes since the fire that locals remark on nearly constantly are the views. Originally built out into dense forests, Paradise today is a changed land. One million trees have been removed; the coastal range to the west and Sawmill Peak and the Sierra foothills to the east are now visible. Roads are being newly paved or reconfigured and blocked by flaggers. Utility crews are digging trenches and burying all the new power lines underground. And main thoroughfares are clogged with construction traffic. All the new homes have to meet tougher wildfire codes, including a new local ordinance that bans any porches or other fixtures built from combustible materials in the immediate perimeter of houses. Paradise's former Mayor Jody Jones says Paradise is becoming one of the safest towns in California. ""We're building a resilient town that the people here care a lot about,"" Jones says. Former Mayor Jody Jones rebuilt a new, more wildfire fire resistant home on the lot where she and her husband lost everything in the Camp Fire.Kirk Siegler/NPRhide caption Former Mayor Jody Jones rebuilt a new, more wildfire fire resistant home on the lot where she and her husband lost everything in the Camp Fire. Not easy in a rural area where there was a severe housing and labor shortage before the Camp Fire. Jones and her husband were among the first 100 survivors to secure new building permits and were able to rebuild and move back within two years of the fire. But she knows they're probably outliers. In recent meetings with leaders in Lahaina, Hawaii, Jones has been advising that a disaster recovery in this era can take decades. ""It's a ton of work. It's not going to happen overnight,"" Jones says. ""But considering it's only been five years and we had a pandemic in the middle of that, what we've accomplished is a miracle."" Before the Camp Fire, Paradise typically saw about a dozen new homes built in any given year. Now, it's averaging 600, even with much tougher zoning. Town leaders tried to account for the rising costs by streamlining permitting, even offering preapproved fire-wise design plans. ""We actually hear a lot from people outside of the community, saying, 'Wow, this is taking a really long time,'"" says Colette Curtis, recovery coordinator for the Town of Paradise. ""Our perspective is we feel really good about the pace of this recovery."" Town leaders like to say that they're now existing in the largest construction site in the world. They acknowledge that the new construction is pricing some people out. Housing costs were way lower when most of the homes on the ridge were built in the 1950s and 1960s. But you can't just put everything back how it was or there could be another Camp Fire. ""We could spend our time as human beings running from those disasters continually or we can spend our time learning how to live in these places in a resilient and safe way,"" Curtis says. Paradise recovery coordinator Colette Curtis stands along a newly finished streetscaping project in what town leaders hope will be a new central business district.Kirk Siegler/NPRhide caption Paradise recovery coordinator Colette Curtis stands along a newly finished streetscaping project in what town leaders hope will be a new central business district. This costs a lot of money. And it turns out a lot of the aid coming into disaster areas — like the millions pouring into Lahaina right now — tends to go to rebuilding infrastructure, not individual private homes. ""We're not good at this in our country,"" says Ed Mayer, executive director of the Housing Authority for Butte County, which includes Paradise. ""Our history of disasters, and no fault of their own, FEMA sort of has a one size fits all approach."" The U.S. government typically comes in and tries to help people find temporary housing quickly while disaster victims figure out how to rebuild. But Mayer says that doesn't work in states like California and Hawaii where there has been a worsening affordable housing crisis for years. ""Our wish at the very outset of this disaster was, hey, we want some soap bubble housing,"" Mayer says. ""And when I say soap bubble housing, we want some housing we can erect tomorrow."" Still, five years later, Mayer's office is celebrating some successes. There are some 3,000 affordable housing units now in development in the county, thanks in large part to housing officials leveraging aid and various grants. Most are not in Paradise, however, and officials say it's probably a fraction of what's actually needed. In the days after the fire, an estimated 35,000 displaced people flooded into nearby cities like Chico. ""To the degree with which you can't meet your immediate need, you're going to be working with either homeless or folks in some transitional status,"" Mayer says. ""It can go on for years."" Bernadette Grant feels like she's been in transition since 2018, moving around various places in Chico all the while wanting to be home in Paradise. Her apartment burned as did her mother's home which had been in the family for fifty years. ""Five years and I really thought at this point a lot more would be rebuilt,"" Grant says. Frustrated, Grant and her partner Richard Fox eventually decided to try building on their own on a lot she owns outside Paradise that didn't burn in the Camp Fire. Bernadette Grant and Richard Fox are building an off-grid home with lumber milled from cleared out trees on a property Grant owns near Paradise that didn't burn in the Camp Fire.Kirk Siegler/NPRhide caption Bernadette Grant and Richard Fox are building an off-grid home with lumber milled from cleared out trees on a property Grant owns near Paradise that didn't burn in the Camp Fire. They're now clearing out dense stands of ponderosa pine that pose a fire risk — many are diseased or dead from bark beetles — and milling them into lumber. They're also going off grid. They erected large solar panels a few yards from where their planned 1,200-square-foot home will be built. Many here are still angry it's taken survivors as long as it has to get settlement money from the utility PG&E, whosedowned powerlines started the Camp Fire. ""A lot of people haven't been paid off for all the damages that's been done to them already,"" Fox says. ""That's ridiculous, five years, they lost everything."" Grant called it a leap of faith to move back up here with the threat of more wildfires ever present. The two are living in an RV for now and plan to stay through the winter even when the snow falls. They're not sure where else they could live that's not threatened by climate change, pointing to the recent deadly wildfires in the tropics. ""There's no place on Earth that's perfect and completely safe,"" Grant says."

[+] properties due to climate events. For most of the U.S. population, summarizing a home as shelter is a fairly gross underrepresentation of what a home actually delivers, but now many are looking for shelter from more extreme climate events that are capable of reducing our current housing to underperforming shelters. While the challenges have always existed, global real estate data platform CoreLogic reports ever-increasing risks and that now more than 18 million properties valued at $8 trillion are at extreme risk. There are mechanisms in place for protection, such as building codes, insurance, better forecasting, and new design with better performing materials, however, even these mechanisms are proving to have failure points, and sometimes major gaps. Growing Risks Risks are defined in many ways, and to make things even more complicated, housing stakeholders look at them through completely different lenses. A home insurance company evaluates risk differently than the builder, who is different than the homeowner, who is different than the architect. These disparities certainly don’t help the situation, but at the same time, none of the stakeholders can argue with the looming danger of stronger weather events. CoreLogic’s data analyzes property-level physical attributes, property-level financial data, specific peril impacts, and a variety of climate scenarios, to understand the current and future financial impact. The company’s data also takes the age of the housing stock into account, making both granularity and scale important in the outputs. “What CoreLogic does is identify the financial risk for every property in the U.S.,” said Anand Srinivasan, who acts as executive of innovation at CoreLogic. “If the property is greater than 100 square feet, then we have calculated loss estimates and created risk scores that incorporate present and future climate risk. Now, we are getting demand from government officials to look at longer periods because of capital investments.” The data provides a holistic view of all potential hazards, including floods, hurricane winds, wildfires, severe convective storms, severe winter storms, along with earthquake activity. From there, the data can help identify the top risks in financial terms by looking at potential loss, making CoreLogic a useful tool for insurance companies and mortgage originators in underwriting and financial evaluations of properties and policies and portfolios of properties. The data is comprehensive and overwhelming, but the value of the data is critical to all the stakeholders. “We look at the delineation between coverage amount and the mortgage amount, the home value, the equity value, and the reconstruction costs,” Srinivasan said. “And, they all are moving targets, but it helps articulate the risk and then helps define actions on what could be done to reduce the risk and has an impact on what the owner would do.” There are dozens of examples. For instance, the Federal Reserve Board has published a paper using CoreLogic data to identify what destroys a community, defined by the tipping point for consumers to walk away from their damaged property because the damage is too extensive. There have already been instances when a homeowner would choose to use their insurance payment to pay off any remaining loan and then walk away. This sort of data could be the catalyst for a community renovation, funding or what has tragically happened, insurance leaving the area. To understand the data a little better, CoreLogic defines “extreme risk” properties as those having a climate risk score of greater than or equal to 70 out of 100 in any time horizon, or as having a shift in climate risk score between any two time horizons of greater than or equal to 40. Top metrics discussed here include all risks together, but are defined for each peril as well, and exceeding the limit for any one of them defines the property as extreme. The company also uses the term “grave danger” to highlight the magnitude of properties and dollars concentrated in these geographies when compared to the majority of other geographies in the U.S., but has not yet refined their criteria as detailed as “extreme risk.” The data also can be represented over different time horizons to capture a future spike, such as a flood in an area currently suffering a long period of drought, which again could be a catalyst for a community retrofit project. In CoreLogic’s analysis of all markets across the U.S. of extreme risk properties, the reconstruction cost or the dollars needed to rebuild the home in a total loss event, and the total home values or what the home would sell for today, it reports a total of 18 million properties valued at $8 trillion with California, Florida and Texas each carrying between 2.5 and 3.8 million homes. The value at risk in the Miami area is the highest in the country and so are the property counts. Of all the extreme risk properties in the country, about 12% of the units and the value reside in Miami today at 1 million homes with $$814 billion in value, and that risk remains strong over time. The San Francisco area has a slightly lower share of extreme risk houses, but the properties are valued higher on a per house basis, with half a million homes with $600 billion in value at risk. The same goes for San Jose, with 333,000 homes valued at $450 billion and Los Angeles with 383,000 homes valued at $356 billion. Texas is experiencing the opposite phenomenon with a higher percentage of homes at risk, but that are valued lower. So, the highest value of destruction is in the three California cities and the highest population impacted would be in the Dallas and Houston areas. With no mitigation to increase property resiliency with increases in climate risk, a risk score will change from 15 to 54 out of 100 by 2050. Nearly 300,000 model runs of impacts are replicated on the property to project average loss rate in a single year. Risk scores provide a normalized method to easily compare risk across geographies and time without having to do all the math, and an additional score is used to calculate dollars of loss based on the exposure, which is the reconstruction cost. The Failing Role of Building Codes This overhead view of two adjacent properties shows how a fence can act like a wick leading wildfire ... [+] straight to a structure. While building codes are in place for a very good reason, the development of the codes and the management of the codes come with many challenges. Ian Giammanco serves as the managing director of standard and data analytics and lead research at the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety and explains that building codes can be adopted and enforced at a number of levels, with state-level building codes standing out as the only to be uniformly enforced. Local and county codes become a bit more haphazard in their enforcement. “We advocate for statewide code because it is uniformly enforced and it is easier for all,” he said. He provides a strong example. In Florida in 1992, there were many variants of building codes at state, county and city levels, causing conflicts and misunderstanding, so the enforcement was not as strong as it should have been. Those disparities had devastating consequences when the strongest hurricane in Florida’s history hit in 1992 when Hurricane Andrew hit, resulting in the most deaths and the highest dollar of destruction in history. “Codes are there for the communities of tomorrow, so they need to be in place before we build,” Giammanco said. “Every three years code gets updated. They need to be updated regularly so that the latest engineering and science is in there.” As hurricanes continue to batter homes in Florida, the building code improves and now it usually is ranked as first or second in terms of effectiveness nationwide. “Following Hurricane Ian in 2022, we looked at 3,600 homes, 455 of which were built under the modern Florida Building Code, and none had structural damage,” he said. “It shows that the work that is being done is valuable and powerful.” In other extreme events, like wildfires, building codes have a long way to go. “Wildfires hit from the outside in and building codes usually deal with fires that ignite inside a property,” he said. “Only two states, California and Utah, have a wildfire-centric code in place today that is effective to protect outside in.” With the age of today’s housing stock, retrofits and renovations will be critical to protect residents from future events. The building codes for these remodels is harder to manage and to inspire participation with because homeowners have to commit to the upfront costs. A good example of this is the FORTIFIED program that has three levels and roof replacement is one of them. When a homeowner elects to reroof their home, it provides a good opportunity to do something stronger or better. Giammanco has seen successful incentive programs that will cover the cost differential or a claim to cover the added cost to go to a FORTIFIED roof so that the homeowner isn’t responsible for the extra expense, but gets better protection. Insurance Impacts This home was built to the FORTIFIED standard, a voluntary beyond-code construction method that ... [+] strengthens areas of buildings typically vulnerable to high winds and heavy rain. The CoreLogic data consists of 110,000,000 single family residences and, unfortunately, there is no industry-wide accessibility to which properties have insurance that would lead to smarter, safer communities. “We actually could get at analytics if there was industry-wide information on name of the insurer and the coverage A amount on the actual policy,” Srinivasan said. “That would go a long way in identifying under insured gaps. With the vast amount of loans being government backed, it’s surprising there isn’t easily accessible data on it.” Having that knowledge would completely transform this space that is incredibly difficult to manage currently with such little transparency. One means to help today would be to develop more precision in how loss is predicted so that the insurance companies can make appropriate offerings. “The private insurance market is what people really need to get the options for the best price and we have to maintain that,” Giammanco said. “With the changing landscape because of climate, we have to make structures stronger. Insurers are going to look at new products – like parametric insurance that is already in commercial space and might move into residential where the event severity triggers the right coverage.” To help solve these equations, there is a need for better building envelope materials along with better test standards to improve those materials. Then, those materials have to be deployed in the market at a reasonable price to scale up. For instance, composite materials are good at preventing hail damage but are still too expensive. In the case of fire, it’s more complicated and relies on a system where insuring individual homes doesn’t solve for the challenge. “Why fire is so scary is that in suburban neighborhoods, the codes didn’t account for it,” he said. “The neighborhood issue is hard because if two homes are close together and one is perfect but has one weakness it can be exploited because the neighbor did no mitigation. For us to tackle fire we have to do it at large scale – neighborhood, community scale to drive it.” Alabama and Louisiana recently implemented a very successful retrofit grant campaign to bring homes up to code and prevent future damage. The states joke that their grants sell out faster than Taylor Swift concert tickets. After the 2005 hurricane season, Alabama acknowledged it had to do something to maintain a good private insurance space. Launching the Smart Home Alabama program to drive consumer demand to set a benchmark of the minimum that you could do to build to the FORTIFIED standard. Growth started to kick in as builders caught on and local jurisdictions got involved. The grants got more funding and individual insurance carried beyond. “Almost a quarter of all homes in those counties are now built to that standard,” he said. “More than 45,000 homes in those two counties have the designation of being FORTIFIED. It wasn’t just insurance, it was incentives. Grants are like pressing a button for awareness.” Developing New Defenses Across the pond, William Swan and his team at Energy House 2.0 have developed one of the world’s most sophisticated testing centers that help manufacturers and industry players understand climate impacts on a variety of scales. “We need to build a new product,” he said about today’s housing. “The product previously built has been built for many, many years and there are issues around financing, insurance, between builders and energy providers. The business models are changing, so all the underlying institutional frameworks have to adjust.” Snow covers the ground of a testing chamber at the University of Salford's Energy House 2.0 testing ... [+] center. At the Energy House there are testing chambers where the team can construct a whole building, giving a holistic picture of the inputs, while also reducing the length and the expense of field trials. Wind, snow and solar can be measured in the chamber showing impacts on temperature, and the relative humidity. “At the lab, you can compress the time to undertake research by controlling the weather and by doing repeated experiments,” Swan said. “There are more data to see why things worked, not just if they worked, which is difficult in the field. We also could change the house as needed, energy systems, boilers, different ways to control, EVs, renewables and how all these things interact and even down to what difference does carpet make to energy efficiency.” Swan says the testing is all about the future. For example, Energy House is working with the homebuilders Bellway and Barratt to test the product they will be offering in 2025. “The demands on the performance of those buildings is much higher,” he said. “They have been building the same thing for 50 years, but future home standards means that they cannot use gas and the standards for building are much higher, which may be difficult to scale using traditional building methods.” The future also means issues that aren’t prevalent today, like overheating and making homes very water efficient to deal with droughts. The new extremes with hurricane force winds are very difficult but can be tested in the chambers, along with flooding by building a concrete base around the house and filling it with water. “When the homes are built, we put sensors in the walls, and each home has nearly $50,000 of sensors so every circuit or element can be monitored,” he said. The sensors provide data that is then collected and analyzed. Then, Energy House distributes the new knowledge to the industry at large to inform regulatory standards groups and policy bodies. Providing the research and doing the science is in the lab’s expert hands but leaves a fundamental responsibility to the builders. “As much as we are doing the science, the builders need to tell a story that the consumers can understand and make as usable as possible,” Swan said. Innovation is gaining ground, with homes such as this cantilevered design that can survive floodplains – a great story for a home buyer. Here are three other housing innovations that stand up to the most aggressive hurricane forces. As the future data predicts, we need to be prepared – with smarter products, systems, and programs. Game on."

For this new study, the researchers looked at associations between the number of houses burned by wildfires and the reasons for it.The researchers looked at statistics for all the known wildfires in the U.S. over the years 1990 to 2020. They also looked at statistics for homes that exist or were built in wildland urban interface (WUI) areas—where homes are built next tonatural areas—over the same time period.The team found that the amount of land characterized as WUI grew by approximately 31% over the study period. They also found that the number of houses in WUI areas grew by 46%, which today numbers approximately 44 million. And they found that the number of houses burned in wildfires has doubled over the past 30 years—55,000 houses have burned in just the past 12 years.The research team concludes that despite the increased risk, newhouseconstruction in WUI areas continues unabated, suggesting that wildfire risk is not discouraging development—a find that further suggests an increasing number of houses will burn in the coming years."

No one was injured and no homes burned in the latest fire, which scorched mountain ridges on Oahu, but the flames wiped out irreplaceable native forestland that's home to nearly two dozen fragile species. And overall, the ingredients are the same as they were in Maui's historic town of Lahaina: severe drought fueled by climate change is creating fire inHawaiiwhere it has almost never been before. “It was really beautiful native forest,” said JC Watson, the manager of the Koolau Mountains Watershed Partnership, which helps take care of the land. He recalled it had uluhe fern, which often dominate Hawaii rainforests, and koa trees whose wood has traditionally been used to make canoes, surfboards and ukuleles. “It’s not a full-on clean burn, but it is pretty moonscape-looking out there,” Watson said. The fact that this fire was on Oahu’s wetter, windward side is a “red flag to all of us that there is change afoot,” said Sam ’Ohu Gon III, senior scientist and cultural adviser at The Nature Conservancy in Hawaii. The fire mostly burned inside the Oahu Forest National Wildlife Refuge, which is home to 22 species listed as endangered or threatened by the U.S. government. They include iiwi and elepaio birds, a tree snail called pupu kani oe and the Hawaiian hoary bat, also known as opeapea. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge, does not know yet what plants or wildlife may have been damaged or harmed by the fire, spokesperson Kristen Oleyte-Velasco said. The fire incinerated 2.5 square miles (6.5 square kilometers) since first being spotted on Oct. 30 and was 90% contained as of Friday. Officials were investigating the cause of the blaze roughly 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Honolulu. The flames left gaping, dark bald spots amid a blanket of thick green where the fire did not burn. The skeletons of blackened trees poked from the charred landscape. The burn area may seem relatively small compared to wildfires on the U.S. continent, which can raze hundreds of square miles. But Hawaii's intact native ecosystems aren't large to begin with, especially on smaller islands like Oahu, so even limited fires have far-reaching consequences. One major concern is what plants will grow in place of the native forest. Hawaii’s native plants evolved without encountering regular fires and fire is not part of their natural life cycle. Faster-growing non-native plants with more seeds tend to sprout in place of native species afterward. Watson said an Oahu forest near the latest fire had uluhe ferns, koa trees and ohia trees before a blaze burned less than a square mile of it 2015. Now the land features invasive grasses that are more fire-prone, and some slow-growing koa. A much larger 2016 fire in the Waianae mountains on the other side of Oahu took out one of the last remaining populations of a rare tree gardenia, said Gon. There are cultural losses when native forest burns. Gon recalled an old Central Oahu story about a warrior who was thrown off a cliff while battling an enemy chief. His fall was stopped by an ohia tree, another plant common in the incinerated area. Feathers from Hawaii's forest birds were once used to make cloaks and helmets worn by chiefs. Watson's organization is coordinating with the Fish and Wildlife Service to conduct initial surveys of the damage. They'll devise a restoration plan that will include invasive species control and planting native species. But there are limits to what can be done. “It’ll never be able to be returned to its previous state within our lifetimes,"" Watson said. “It's forever changed, unfortunately.” The Mililani Mauka fire — named after the area near where the fire began — burned in the Koolau mountains. These mountains are on Oahu's wetter, windward side because they trap moisture and rain that move across the island from the northeast. But repeated and more prolonged episodes of drought are making even the Koolaus dry. Gon expects more frequent Koolau fires in the future. “There has been a huge uptick in the last 10 years, largely in Waianae range, which is the western and drier portion of the island,” Gon said. “But now we’re seeing fires in the wet section of the island that normally doesn’t see any fires at all.” Hawaii fires are almost always started by humans so Gon said more needs to be done to raise awareness about prevention. Native forests could be further protected with buffer zones by planting less flammable vegetation in former sugarcane and pineapple plantation lands often found at lower elevations, he said. Many of these now-fallow fields sprout dry, invasive grasses. Such grasses fueled the blaze that raced across Lahaina in August, highlighting their dangers. The cause of that fire is still being investigated, but it may have been sparked by downed power lines that ignited dry grass. Winds related to a powerful hurricane passing to the south helped spread the blaze, which destroyed more than 2,000 buildings and homes for some 8,000 people. The fire is likely to affect Oahu’s fresh water supply, though this is challenging to measure. Oahu’s 1 million residents and visitors get their drinking water from aquifers, but it usually takes decades for rain to seep through the ground to recharge them. Native forests are the best at absorbing rain so the disappearance of high-quality forest is certain to have some effect, Watson said. State officials are seeking additional funding from the Legislature next year for updated firefighting equipment, firebreaks, new water sources for fire suppression, replanting native trees and plants, and seed storage. Firefighters and rain last week finally tamped down the Oahu blaze, but Gon urged action now “to make sure that it doesn’t turn into yearly fires nibbling away at the source of our water supply.”"

The vehicle, a Model X, caught alight Friday andtook firefighters hours to put outafter they threw a tarp on it and rolled it out onto the street in the city of Plano, Texas, local ABC affiliate station WFAA reported. TheTeslaowner told WFAA he had the new battery installed Thursday at a Tesla dealership in Plano, which is part of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metro area. When he checked the car in the early hours of Friday morning, he saw flames coming from the battery and called the fire department. Avideoshared by the BBC from the incident shows the vehicle engulfed in flames with multiple firefighters attempting to put it out using hoses. It then shows the car jacked up on one side covered in ash after the fire was extinguished while smoke still comes from the vehicle. ""The guys were quick thinking. Once they put the tarp on the car and were able to contain the fire underneath that tarp, they quickly hooked some tow chains underneath and dragged it using one of our battalions,"" Daniel Daly, a Plano Fire-Rescue lieutenant, told the news station. Daly said the cause of the fire is still being investigated. He added that they knew that they ""had to get on that battery"" because it is an electric vehicle. Fortunately, the fire rescue team in Plano are specially trained on how to contain a lithium battery fire and cool it, per WFAA. EV fires are ""extremely difficult to extinguish"", according to a UK-based fire and rescue service. That's because lithium batteries release heat from the energy they store as well as toxic gasses. The batteries are also at risk of catching fire multiple times after the first incident,posing as a fire hazardfor several days, Essex County Fire and Rescue Service said in a July press release about adapting to the new hazard. Another Tesla""spontaneously caught fire""on a California highway in January and it took about 6,000 gallons of water to extinguish it. ""A fully involved traditional combustion vehicle can be extinguished with a single fire engine's 700 gallon water supply,"" the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Departmentsaid in a Facebook post at the time. They added that the fire originated in the battery compartment of the Model S. Tesla Plano didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, made outside of normal working hours."

The White House Fellowship program provides young leaders an opportunity to gain first-hand experience at the highest levels of federal government. The White House Fellows often return to their previous professions with a much better appreciation for government service. White House Fellows work closely with Cabinet members, senior White House Staff, or other top-ranking government officials. I had the honor and opportunity to work directly for Secretary Edward J. Derwinski, the first Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary. Upon entering the Department of Veterans Affairs headquarters, I saw a plaque near the entrance inscribed with words taken from President Abraham Lincoln’s second inaugural address, which he delivered on March 4, 1865. The plaque’s inscription: “To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan.” A plaque near the Department of Veterans Affairs entrance from President Abraham Lincoln’s second ... [+] inaugural address on March 4, 1865 As we reflect on Veterans Day, it is important to acknowledge that freedom is not free and comes at a cost. Those who have “borne the battle” have sacrificed much, some with their lives, and some with great physical and emotional pain, so that many others can live in freedom. Their families also serve and sacrifice. Today we cannot assume enough young men and women will volunteer to serve in our military. And without a strong military, businesses will not succeed. So, business leaders have a role in ensuring our nation remains strong through a strong military. NEW YORK - FEBRUARY 20: The U.S. Armed Forces Recruiting Station in Times Square sits nestled among ... [+] skycrapers February 20, 2003 in New York City.

(Photo by Chris Hondros/Getty Images) Currently, most of our military services are not able to accomplish their recruiting missions. The Army is the largest military service and has failed to achieve its recruiting mission by 15,000 and 10,000 recruits in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The U.S. Army has ten divisions, the core of the fighting force. A U.S. Army Division has approximately 15,000 soldiers, so the current shortage of recruits is significant. Considering the recruit deficit in the Air Force (2,700) and the Navy (6,000), the total active-duty shortfall is approximately 18,700. The challenge is even greater when considering the shortfall in our military's Reserve and National Guard components. How would a private sector business perform with this level of personnel shortages? Miami Beach, Florida, Hyundai Air & Sea Show, Military Village vendor, Army, fitness strength test, ...

The pool of eligible and interested candidates is decreasing for various reasons. There are health, fitness, education, and conduct issues, the civilian market remains competitive, and there is less familiarity with military service. If not enough young men and women are willing to serve their country in uniform, our country should consider its options. While America’s military forces face challenges in recruiting, in contrast, virtually every able-bodied person in Ukraine and Israel is serving their country to protect their freedom.

In the past fifty years of the AVF, our military has benefitted from a professional force of individuals who have chosen to serve. Although recruiting is challenging, our military is doing well with retention. A conscripted force would impact the cost and efficiencies gained through the AVF since retention rates would suffer. So, the AVF is good for our military and for our country. However, our nation should consider the importance of national service, whether in the military, public education, government, police force, firefighters, or many other areas where young men and women could serve their country.

Having people skilled in the public arena and then serving in the private sector will help businesses better understand how to work successfully on complex matters that can only be solved when our public and private sectors work together. For example, consider AmeriCorps, a network of local, state, and national service programs. AmeriCorps is a federal agency that brings people together to address critical challenges through national service and volunteering. AmeriCorps volunteers, ages 18-26, serve to meet community needs in education, the environment, public safety, health, and homeland security.

These volunteers serve a purpose greater than themselves. As the country considers national service, part of the incentive could be the repayment of college loans. Businesses can incentivize national service by hiring young people who have developed many skills through volunteer efforts. Incentivizing national service could help young people to consider service in our military, public education, and many other professions in the public sector. Those young people in the public sector learn many skills that will serve the private sector well. They learn about leadership, problem-solving, budgeting, finance, stakeholder engagement, communication skills, adaptability, and resilience. Public sector employees serve a purpose greater than themselves. This important value helps these employees to be mission-oriented in their approach. Public sector employees look to create value over the longer term. They optimize the resources available and work well with diverse teams. They also understand how to succeed in working with local, state, and federal governments. Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. government’s effort to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development, is an excellent example of a public-private partnership where the private and the public sector came together to make a significant difference. Those in the private sector with public sector experience are invaluable in these public-private partnerships. Our All-Volunteer Force must succeed. To do so, it will require each young American to be open to the idea of public service. Today less than 1% of Americans serve in the military. Those who choose to serve in our military will become the next generation of veterans. Families of those who serve also sacrifice much. So, on this Veterans Day, we also honor our veterans’ family members. A tomb guard of the 3rd US Infantry Regiment, known as ""The Old Guard,"" walks before a centennial ...

Prisoner advocates say this allows forced prison labor, but systemic change has been met with resistance.Charlotte Gomez for NPRhide caption The U.S. Prisoner advocates say this allows forced prison labor, but systemic change has been met with resistance. After a few months working in his prison's hot and crowded kitchen, Richard Lilgerose noticed he was having trouble sleeping. ""I was always anxious about having to go to the kitchen and work under these conditions for hours upon hours and not knowing when I was going to be able to go back to my unit to get some rest,"" he told NPR in a call from prison. Lilgerose, who has been in prison for 20 years, suffers from PTSD, and says the chaos of the kitchen made it hard to work there. He kept asking for breaks, and eventually the guards stopped making him work. But Lilgerose says they also punished him, moving him to a unit with less access to the outdoors and to phones. He says he also lost ""good time,"" which can determine parole eligibility. What Lilgerose experienced is common in prisons nationwide. The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution abolished slavery, but it included an exception: Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist,it declares, except as punishment for a crime. Prison rights advocates say this exception allows for forced labor in prisons. The unexpected part of Lilgerose's story isn't so muchwhathe experienced, butwherehe experienced it. Lilgerose is in prison in Colorado, a state that changed its own constitution to say no one could be forced to work, not even prisoners. Five years ago this month, Colorado became the first state in modern U.S. history to enact this constitutional change. (Rhode Island banned slavery without exception in 1842.) Since then, there has been a growing movement across the U.S. to get rid of what's become known as the ""exception clause."" Nebraska, Utah, Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont have all changed their constitutions in the past three years. At least nine more have introduced legislation, including Nevada, where residentswill vote on this issue in 2024. But in Colorado, the daily lives of people behind bars haven't changed. ""Unfortunately, here we are five years later, and we have not seen the change happen inside of our prisons. It's been business as usual,"" says Kym Ray, a community organizer with Together Colorado, a multi-faith community organization. ""It was never intended to be a symbolic sort of thing, like we removed it from our constitution with no expectation of change. We actually did, in fact, expect there to be some level of change."" A spokesperson for Colorado's Department Of Corrections declined NPR's request for an interview and declined to comment, because of pending litigation. There aremore than a million peoplein state and federal prisons across the country. Most of them work, and three quarters say they're required to, according tothe most recent numbersfrom the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. ""The reality is that once people enter the prison gates, they lose the right to refuse to work,"" says Jennifer Turner, a human rights researcher at the ACLU and the lead author ona report released last year on prison labor. Most prison workers maintain the institutions where they're held. In New York, prisoners alsostaff DMV call centers. In Michigan, theymake license plates. In Louisiana, theyserve lawmakers food. In North Carolina, theywork on highway crews. In 14 statesincluding California, prisoners fight wildfires. In Texas,some prison farmsare located on the same land as former slave plantations. Coloradoused to sell goat cheeseto Whole Foods, though the company stopped amid public outcry. In 2020, the stategenerated more than $6 millionselling to around 100 private companies. Nationwide, prisoners oftenmake less than a dollar an hour, and courts have ruled that laws protecting workers outside of prison, likethe Fair Labor Standards Act, do not apply inside.

""They're stripped of every legal right, virtually, that workers outside of prisons and jails have,"" Turner says. Andrea Armstrong, a professor of law at Loyola University New Orleans, says penalties for refusing work can vary widely. ""You could get a disciplinary write-up and that might be what we think of as a ticket. Maybe you can't use the commissary service or maybe you can't have visitation for a week or two. And that's one end of the spectrum,"" she says. ""The other end of the spectrum is that you can be sent to solitary confinement and the time that you spend alone in a cell is 23 hours a day."" In 2018, Colorado's constitution went from this: ""There shall never be in this state either slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted."" To this: ""There shall never be in this state either slavery or involuntary servitude."" Full stop. ""When it passed, we celebrated, and I don't think it hit me until after the watch party,"" says Kamau Allen, who helped lead the effort and is a founding member of the Abolish Slavery National Network. ""I got in my car and I cried. I cried because I realized that we just made history."" Activists in other states began calling to learn more. Allen had high hopes until he started to hear from community members. ""A member of my church came up to me and said, 'You know, we're so happy that this passed. But my nephew, who is serving time right now, wants to know why, after this has passed, he's still forced to work against his will.' And that was one of the moments when the reality kicked in that this is a long, long process,"" Allen says. In fact, data obtained by NPR from the Colorado Department of Corrections indicates that more than 14,000 prisoners have been written up for failing to work since 2019, the year after the amendment passed. Hundreds of them were reprimanded, including being assigned more work or losing other privileges. Lilgerose, the man assigned to his prison's kitchen, and another prisonerfiled a lawsuitlast year, saying Colorado is violating its newly amended constitution. The state has argued the lawsuit should be dismissed and thattaking away privilegesis not the same as punishment. The case is now in discovery. ""It is really very simple. It's accountability. There is no accountability,"" says Abron Arrington, who was in prison in Colorado when the amendment passed. Hewas granted clemency in 2019. ""Legislators, if you're just like, 'OK, well we passed the bill, we've done our part. DOC can figure out how to do that and work that out.' DOC is not going to work it out."" In Colorado,skeptics of the changeto the state's constitution worried mostly that court-mandated community service and other work programs could inadvertently be affected. Michael Gibson-Light, an assistant professor of sociology and criminology at the University of Denver, thinks there's another reason why prison labor is difficult to dismantle. Much of the work of prison maintenance — cooking, cleaning, laundry, grounds keeping — is done by the people being held there, for little and sometimes no pay. A corrections officer watches as prisoners work in the kitchen at the Ellsworth Correctional Facility in Ellsworth, Kan., in December 2015.Charlie Riedel/APhide caption A corrections officer watches as prisoners work in the kitchen at the Ellsworth Correctional Facility in Ellsworth, Kan., in December 2015. ""If that flow of cheap or free labor were to stop, I think the fear is that the entire institution would possibly need to shut down,"" Gibson-Light says. ""It's not an unrealistic fear because speaking to the inertia of this whole system, this has been the way that we've manned these facilities for generations. And so to suddenly stop, it would be a budgetary nightmare."" Prison workers produce at least $11 billion a year in goods and services across the country, according to the ACLU report. That labor offsets the cost of the prison system. Some government officials in states like Florida and California, where measures to ban slavery outright have been introduced, have made this argument. In Florida, a former county commissionertold The Florida Times-Union: ""There's no way we can take care of our facilities, our roads, our ditches, if we didn't have inmate labor. ... We could not tax our citizens enough to replace the value that the inmate labor contributes to our community."" In California, the state's Assembly Appropriations Committee noted in an analysis that if changing its constitution forced the state to pay prisoners minimum wage, itcould cost taxpayers billions of dollars per year. But Allen, the Colorado organizer, says the cost is more than just financial. ""It's also a human cost. We had this conversation back in the 1860s that, oh, abolishing slavery would be too costly for our economy,"" he says. ""I don't think anybody now would disagree that that was a price worth paying."" Armstrong, the Loyola professor, says these amendments are important, especially in terms of addressing the harm to human dignity that people suffer while incarcerated. ""It is no small matter to feel like you are a slave,"" she says. ""That being said, so much of the conversation around these amendments has also focused on the political realities of getting them passed and to do so, the ballot language itself has often reaffirmed the ability of a Department of Corrections to force someone to work.""

Armstrong pointed to Utah as an example: Voters thereremoved the exception clause, but the change also included a note that it ""does not apply to the otherwise lawful administration of the criminal justice system."" ""It's not clear to me that in any state where that amendment was adopted, that the Departments of Corrections actually said, 'Oh, OK, it's our understanding that we will not force anybody to work again,'"" she says. The conversation around constitutional amendments, she says, has to be accompanied by one about fair wages, training and worker protections inside prisons. ""[People in prison] are not looking for a future where they don't work. So many people I've talked to have talked about the value of work that they learned behind bars,"" Armstrong says. ""They want to do work that's meaningful and that they have a choice in. And that is not an extreme request."" In Colorado, the community organizers that led the original campaign are now regrouping. And other states are paying attention. In New York, for instance, organizers are exploring a different route toward the same goal: Advocating for a statute to be passed by the state legislature, rather than a constitutional amendment. They say this route will create change faster. ""We're trying to be very explicit in the corrections law about what the intent and purpose of this law is,"" says Brandon Holmes, an organizer at the New York Civil Liberties Union. ""We're not leaving room for interpretation."""

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said it was the largest federal investment ever in grid infrastructure, supporting projects that will harden electric systems and improve energy reliability and affordability. The federal spending, combined with money promised by private partners, could result in up to $8 billion in investments nationally to upgrade the grid, Granholm said. “The grid, as it currently sits, is not is not equipped to handle all the new demand” and withstand natural disasters and extreme weather worsened byclimate change, Granholm said at a news conference Wednesday. “We need it to be bigger, we need it to be stronger, we need it to be smarter” to bring a range of renewable energy projects online and meet the Biden administration’s goal of reaching 100% clean electricity by 2035, she said. Projects funded by the federalGrid Resilience and Innovation Partnershipsprogram will increase the flexibility, efficiency and reliability of electric power systems, with a particular focus on spurring solar, wind, and other renewable energy, Granholm said. The projects also are aimed at fixing problems that may contribute to wildfires and other disasters and will improve reliability by deploying innovative approaches to electricity transmission, storage and distribution, she and other officials said. Projects to be funded include $249 million each for rural areas in Georgia and Louisiana and $250 million for a Native American tribe in Oregon. The largest grant, $464 million, will go to improve five transmission projects across seven Midwestern states, from Iowa to North Dakota. The money includes $95 million previously announced for Hawaii in the wake of devastating wildfires this summer, and $150 million to PacifiCorp to upgrade the grid in California, Oregon, Utah and other states. “Our outdated grid has been in need of an update for a long, long time,″ said Mitch Landrieu, a White House senior adviser who coordinates implementation of the2021 infrastructure lawsigned by President Joe Biden. The grid “is especially vulnerable to the increasing impacts of the climate crisis,” Landrieu added. “Older equipment can overload during extreme heat and cold when power is needed most. And it’s more likely to fail when communities are washed out by historic floods and decimated by stronger storms.'' The nation's existing power grids are not built to handle the growing energy demand, a fact that is complicated by the intermittent nature of renewables, since energy isn’t generated when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind isn’t blowing. “As we sadly saw in California, aging electricity infrastructure can cause catastrophic loss of life, property, natural areas and forest fires,” said Jonathan Foley, executive director of Project Drawdown, a San Francisco-based group that publicizes climate solutions. The projects announced Wednesday are “exactly the kind of thing that we should be doing: promoting renewables, better storage and better electrical grids for a better, greener, more resilient future,” Foley said. In Georgia, the state's environmental finance authority and companies that supports Georgia's electric cooperatives will team up on a project to upgrade the grid, including investments in battery storage, local microgrids, grid reliability and new transmission lines. The project will focus on remote, historically underinvested communities, Granholm said, including rural Locust Grove, Georgia, where she visited Wednesday as part of the grant rollout. In Louisiana, two projects will focus on helping disadvantaged communities withstand extreme weather and develop microgrids to work with local utilities and back up existing assets. Entergy New Orleans also will enhance the local grid’s resilience to severe weather, including hardening existing transmission lines and distribution systems to reduce outage frequency and duration. CPS Energy in San Antonio will receive $30 million for a resiliency program, and Minnesota-based Xcel Energy will receive $100 million for projects in Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Minnesota and Wisconsin to improve wildfire risk mitigation, including thousands of fire-resistant poles, tree clearing and wind strength testing. Texas has faced repeated challenges, from sweltering heat this summer to a winter blackout in 2021 that knocked out power to millions of customers for days and resulted in hundreds of deaths. In Michigan, DTE Energy will deploy adaptive microgrids in the Detroit area to enhance reliability and reduce outages.

Released every five years, the National Climate Assessment is a congressionally mandated evaluation of the effects of climate change on American life. This new fifth edition paints a picture of a nation simultaneously beset by climate-driven disasters and capable of dramatically reducing emissions of planet-warming gasses in the near future. This is the first time the assessment includes standalone chapters about climate change's toll on the American economy, as well as the complex social factors driving climate change and the nation's responses. And, unlike past installments, the new assessment draws heavily from social science, including history, sociology, philosophy and Indigenous studies. The new approach adds context and relevance to the assessment's robust scientific findings, and underscores the disproportionate danger that climate change poses to poor people, marginalized communities, older Americans and those who work outdoors. ""Climate change affects us all, but it doesn't affect us all equally,"" says climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, one of the authors of the assessment. But threaded throughout the report are case studies and research summaries highlighting ways ""climate action can create a more resilient and just country,"" she says. This is also the first time the National Climate Assessment will be translated into Spanish, although the Spanish-language version won't be available until the spring, according to the White House. The National Climate Assessment is extremely influential in legal and policy circles, and affects everything from court cases about who should foot the bill for wildfire damage, to local decisions about how tall to build coastal flood barriers. ""It really shapes the way that people understand, and therefore act, in relation to climate change,"" says Michael Burger, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. Hundreds of scientists from universities, industry, and federal agencies contributed to the report. They reviewed cutting-edge research published since the last report and contextualized it in decades of foundational climate research. The fifth edition of the assessment arrives as millions of Americans are struggling with the effects of a hotter Earth. Dramatic and deadly wildfires, floods and heat waves killed hundreds of people in the United States in 2023. And, while federal spending on renewable energy and disaster preparedness has increased, the U.S. is alsoinvesting in new fossil fuel infrastructurethat is not compatible with avoiding catastrophic warming later this century. Here are the three big takeaways from theFifth National Climate Assessment. More information about the specific effects of climate change in your area can be found in the assessment'sregional chapters. Windmills near Whitewater, Calif., in 2020.

Chiu/APhide caption Windmills near Whitewater, Calif., in 2020. avoid billions of dollars of economic costs and help Americans live longer, healthier lives according to the Fifth National Climate Assessment. Food, housing, labor – it all gets pricier as the Earth heats up, according to the National Climate Assessment. Climate-driven weather disasters, like heat waves, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, are particularly expensive. They destroy homes and businesses, wreck crops and create supply shortages by delaying trucks, ships and trains. Such disasters make it more likely that families will go bankrupt, and that municipal governments will run deficits, the authors note. Weather-related disasters in the U.S. cause about $150 billion each year in direct losses, according to the report. That's a lot of money – roughly equal to the annual budget for the Energy Department – and it's only expected to go up as the Earth gets hotter. Loading... And that's all before factoring in the less obvious or tangible costs of climate change. For example, healthcare bills for people who are sicker because of extreme heat, or have respiratory illness brought on by breathing in mold after a flood. Exposure to wildfire smoke alone costs billions of dollars a year in lost earnings, the assessment notes – a burden that falls disproportionately on poor people who work outdoors. ""The research indicates that people who are lower income have more trouble adapting [to climate change], because adaptation comes at a cost,"" says Solomon Hsiang, a climate economist at the University of California, Berkeley and a lead author of the assessment. For example, one of the simplest ways to adapt to severe heat waves is to run your air conditioner more. But ""if people can't pay for it, then [they] can't protect themselves,"" explains Hsiang. And the hotter it gets, the more profound the economic harm, assessment warns. Twice as much planetary warming leads to more than twice as much economic harm, the assessment warns.

The latest National Climate Assessment underscores the many ways that climate change is already making Americans sick, and even killing them.Claire Harbage/NPRhide caption A roadside memorial to those who died in the wildfire that swept through the town of Lahaina, Hawaii in August. The latest National Climate Assessment underscores the many ways that climate change is already making Americans sick, and even killing them. Since the previous NCA was released five years ago, the health costs of climate change have gone from theoretical to personal for many Americans. The most obvious risk? Extreme weather, particularly heat, says Mary Hayden, the lead author of the chapter examining human health. Heat waves have become hotter, longer, and more dangerous, and they're hitting areas that aren't ready for them–like the ""record-shattering"" heat dome that descended on the Pacific Northwest in 2021 and caused hundreds of deaths. But it's not just heat. Wildfire smoke can send people thousands of miles from the fires to hospitals with respiratory problems and heart disease complications. Hurricanes can disrupt people's access to healthcare: when a clinic is flooded or people are displaced, for example,kidney patients can't get dialysis treatment. In most cases, the people who bear the brunt of the disasters are those already at risk: poor communities, communities of color, women, people with disabilities, and other marginalized groups. Temperatures in formerly redlined neighborhoods in cities across the country cansoar nearly 15 degrees Fahrenheit hotterthan wealthier areas just blocks away, putting residents at much higher risk of heat exposure. The assessment also homes in on research tracking less-obvious health impacts. Living through climate disasters, for example, can leave lasting emotional scars. ""We're not just talking about [people's] physical health–we're talking about their mental health. We're talking about their spiritual health. We're talking about the health and well-being of communities which are being affected by this,"" Hayden says. That means recognizing the long-term effects on communities like Paradise, California, where people still deal withdeep emotional traumafive years after their town burned in the 2018 Camp Fire. The report also flags the growing emotional toll on children and young people, for whom anxiety about the future of the planet is bleeding into all parts of their lives. A lobsterman paddles out to his boat in a harbor in Maine. Climate change is disrupting ways of living with, and from, the ocean.Ryan Kellmanhide caption The places, cultural practices, and traditions that anchor many communities are also in flux because of climate change. Fishing communities are seeing their livelihoods shift or collapse. The Northeast's iconic lobster fishery, the single most economically valuable in the country, haswithered as marine heatwaves sweep through the regional seas. Shrinking snowpack and too-warm temperatures are interrupting opportunities for beloved recreational activities,like skiing or ice fishing. Indigenous communities are being forced to adjust to new climate realities, which are disrupting traditional food-gathering traditions. In Palau, a monthly tradition of catching fish at a particularly low tide has been upset by sea level rise, which keeps water levels too high to trap fish in thehistorically-used places. Sea level rise is also forcing coastal communities tore-think their very existence,pulling apart the social fabric that has developed over generations. But many communities – Indigenous people, farmers and fishers, groups that have lived tightly connected to their environments for a long time – have deep stores of resilience from which to draw, says Elizabeth Marino, a sociologist and the lead author of the chapter on social transformations. ""There is quite a lot of wisdom in place to adapt to and even mitigate climate change,"" she says. ""It allows people to come up with solutions that fit the lives that they lead, and that's also a place of hope."" The fifth assessment lays out a stark picture of the climate challenges the U.S. faces. Keeping planetary warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the goal of the international Paris Agreement, will require immediate, enormous cuts to fossil fuel emissions in the U.S and beyond. Keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), an ambitious target written into the Agreement, will be even harder, the report says. But it also points out many successful efforts underway to adapt to the new reality and to prevent worse outcomes. ""It's not the message that if we don't hit 1.5 degrees, we're all going to die,"" says Hayhoe. ""It's the message that everything we do matters. Every 10th of a degree of warming we avoid, there's a benefit to that."" Addressing fossil fuel-driven climate change can also help people live healthier lives, stresses J. Jason West, the lead author on a chapter on air quality. Dialing back fossil fuel emissions would help prevent further climate change and also lessen the kinds of air pollution most harmful to human health."" There really is a lot of opportunity to take action that would resolve both of those problems at the same time,"" West says. There's been a subtle shift in the report's perspective since the last one, says Candis Callison, a sociologist and author of the report. There's now a clear acknowledgement, developed through years of rigorous research, that the fossil fuel-powered society the U.S. built over generations was profoundly unjust. Many pollution-producing coal or gas power plants weresited in communities of colorrather than white communities, affecting people's health outcomes for generations. And decisions about land and water use for energy extractionoften excluded tribal communities, with consequences still playing out today. The transition forward can look different, she says. ""Climate change actually provides us with an opportunity to address some of those inequities and injustices–and to respond to these impacts,"" Callison says. ""That's really a powerful thing."""

The report issues a stark warning that extreme events and harmful impacts of climate change that Americans are already experiencing, such as heat waves, wildfires, and extreme rainfall, will worsen as temperatures continue to rise. The Fifth National Climate Assessment, issued every five years, is a definitive breakdown of the latest in climate science coming from 14 different federal agencies, including NOAA, NASA, the EPA, and the National Science Foundation. This year's report is more comprehensive than in previous because climate modeling has improved, and the authors took a more holistic look at physical and social impacts of climate change. ""We also have a much more comprehensive understanding of how climate change disproportionately affects those who've done the least to cause the problem,"" Katherine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and co-author of the report, said in a briefing with reporters. Some communities are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, the report says, warning that Black, Hispanic, and indigenous communities are more likely to face challenges accessing water as droughts become more intense. Climate change also creates more health risks for marginalized communities, according to the report, which says that “systemic racism and discrimination exacerbate” the impacts. The report lays out how every part of the US is being impacted by climate change and that some areas are facing multiple worsening impacts at the same time. For example, western states saw heat waves and wildfires during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which strained resources and added to the risk of severe illness. In the same year, back-to-back storms during the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season are some examples of climate-driven compounding events that caused unprecedented demand on federal emergency response resources. The report detailed some impacts of climate change that are being felt across the U.S., including increased risk of extreme heat and rainfall, among other weather-related events. Other impacts cited werecoastal erosionand threats to coastal communities from flooding; damage to land including wildfires anddamage to forests;warming oceans and damage to ecosystems likecoral reefs;risks from extreme events like fires; heatwaves and flooding, and increased inequality for minority orlow-income communities. Some areas of the U.S. are also seeing more specific impacts, such as more intense droughts in the Southwest. The assessment also notes changes in storm trends as a result of climate change. Heavy snowfall is becoming more common in the Northeast and hurricane trends are changing, with increases in North Atlantic hurricane activity and the intensification of tropical cyclones. 2023 was a record setting year forbillion-dollar climate disastersin the United States, officials noted in a White House briefing last week. The report also highlights some areas of success, saying more action has been taken across the board to reduce emissions and address climate change since the last report in 2018. Greenhouse gas emissions generated by the U.S. have been steadily decreasing since their peak in 2007, even as the energy demand goes up -- mainly due to a vast reduction in the use of coal, according to the report. Efforts to adapt to and respond to climate change need to be more ""transformative,"" the report found. This includes reducing the use of coal, building more wind turbines and electrifying buildings and making more efforts to protect people from the impacts of climate change. Individuals and government leaders should look at the report as a way to help communities across the country mitigate, adapt and become more resilient to the effects of climate change, White House Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi said. The assessment demonstrates ""both a real and profound environmental risk, but also a real and profound economic opportunity,"" Zaidi said. The administration has also noted that adding clean energy jobs is a top priority. The last time the National Climate Assessment was released, then-President Donald Trump said hedid not believe the findings. The 2018 report found that climate change could lead to massive economic loss, especially by vulnerable communities. In addition to theFifth National Climate Assessment, which is U.S.-focused, two global climate reports were also released on Tuesday, analyzing the current state of climate change policy action around the world. UN Climate Changereleased a progress report on climate action ahead of the COP28 conference set to kick off in Dubai on November 30th. The report highlights that progress on global climate action is moving too slow to keep up with the effects of global warming. ""The Global Stocktake report released by UN Climate Change this year clearly shows where progress is too slow. But it also lays out the vast array of tools and solutions put forward by countries. Billions of people expect to see their governments pick up this toolbox and put it to work,"" Simon Stiell, Executive-Secretary of UN Climate Change said. The 2023 State of Climate Actionreportwas also released on Tuesday, highlighting similar concerns that global climate action is not moving fast enough. ""In a year where climate change has been wreaking havoc across the world, it’s clear global efforts to curb emissions are falling short."" Louise Jeffery of NewClimate Institute and one of the report’s lead authors said."

TheNational Climate Assessment, which comes out every four to five years, was released Tuesday with details that bring climate change's impacts down to a local level. Overall, it paints a picture of a country warming about 60% faster than the world as a whole, one that regularly gets smacked with costly weather disasters and faces even bigger problems in the future. Since 1970, the Lower 48 states have warmed by 2.5 degrees (1.4 degrees Celsius) and Alaska has heated up by 4.2 degrees (2.3 degrees Celsius), compared to the global average of 1.7 degrees (0.9 degrees Celsius), the report said. But what people really feel is not the averages, but when weather is extreme. With heat waves, drought, wildfire and heavy downpours, “we are seeing an acceleration of the impacts of climate change in the United States,” said study co-author Zeke Hausfather of the tech company Stripe and Berkeley Earth. And that's not healthy. Climate change is ""harming physical, mental, spiritual, and community health and well-being through the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events, increasing cases of infectious and vector-borne diseases, and declines in food and water quality and security,"" the report said. Compared to earlier national assessments, this year’s uses far stronger language and “unequivocally” blames the burning of coal, oil and gas for climate change. Read more:How Psychology Can Help Fight Climate Change—And Climate Anxiety The 37-chapter assessment includes an interactive atlas that zooms down to the county level. It finds that climate change is affecting people’s security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority and Native American communities often disproportionately at risk. In Alaska, which is warming two to three times faster than the global average, reduced snowpack, shrinking glaciers, thawing permafrost, acidifying oceans and disappearing sea ice have affected everything from the state’s growing season, to hunting and fishing, with projections raising questions about whether some Indigenous communities should be relocated. The Southwest is experiencing more drought and extreme heat – including 31 consecutive days this summer whenPhoenix’s daily high temperaturesreached or exceeded 110 degrees – reducing water supplies and increasing wildfire risk. Northeastern cities are seeing more extreme heat, flooding and poor air quality, as well as risks to infrastructure, while drought and floods exacerbated by climate change threaten farming and ecosystems in rural areas. In the Midwest, both extreme drought and flooding threaten crops and animal production, which can affect the global food supply. In the northern Great Plains, weather extremes like drought and flooding, as well as declining water resources, threaten an economy dependent largely on crops, cattle, energy production and recreation. Meanwhile, water shortages in parts of the southern Great Plains are projected to worsen, while high temperatures are expected to break records in all three states by midcentury. In the Southeast, minority and Native American communities -- who may live in areas with higher exposures to extreme heat, pollution and flooding — have fewer resources to prepare for or to escape the effects of climate change. In the Northwest, hotter days and nights that don't cool down much have resulted in drier streams and less snowpack, leading to increased risk of drought and wildfires. The climate disturbance has also brought damaging extreme rain. Hawaii and other Pacific islands, as well as the U.S. Caribbean, are increasingly vulnerable to the extremes of drought and heavy rain as well as sea level rise and natural disaster as temperatures warm. Brown University climate scientist Kim Cobb, who wasn't part of the assessment team, said, “at the center of the report are people — across every region of the country - who have escalating risks associated with climate change as well as clear opportunities for win-win climate action.” The United States will warm in the future about 40% more than the world as a total, the assessment said. The AP calculated, usingothers'global projections, that would slate America to get about 3.8 degrees (2.1 degrees Celsius) hotter by the end of the century. Hotter average temperatures means weather that is even more extreme. “The news is not good, but it is also not surprising,” said University of Colorado's Waleed Abdalati, a former NASA chief scientist who was not part of this report. “What we are seeing is a manifestation of changes that were anticipated over the last few decades.” The 2,200-page report comes after five straight months when the globe set monthly and daily heat records. It comes as the U.S.has set a record with 25 different weatherdisasters this year that caused at least $1 billion in damage. “Climate change is finally moving from an abstract future issue to a present, concrete, relevant issue. It’s happening right now,” said report lead author Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy and a professor at Texas Tech University. Five years ago, when the last assessment was issued, fewer people were experiencing climate change firsthand. Surveys this year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research show that. In September, about 9 in 10 Americans (87%) said they'd experienced at least one extreme weather event in the past five years — drought, extreme heat, severe storms, wildfires or flooding. That was up from 79% who said that in April. Hayhoe said there's also a new emphasis in the assessment on marginalized communities. “It is less a matter ... of what hits where, but more what hits whom and how well those people can manage the impacts,” said University of Colorado's Abdalati, whose saw much of his neighborhood destroyed in the 2021 Marshall wildfire. Biden administration officials emphasize that all is not lost and the report details actions to reduce emissions and adapt to what's coming. Americans on every level of government are “stepping up to meet this moment,” said White House science adviser Arati Prabhakar. “All of these actions, taken together, give us hope because they tell us that we can do big things at the scale that’s required, at the scale that the climate actually notices.” By cleaning up industry, how electricity is made and how transport is powered, climate change can be dramatically reduced. Hausfather said when emissions stops, warming stops, ""so we can stop this acceleration if we as a society get our act together.” But some scientists said parts of the assessment are too optimistic. “The report's rosy graphics and outlook obscure the dangers approaching,” Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson said. “We are not prepared for what's coming.”"

On newly plowed farms this was seen as a bonus and these introduced worms bolstered food production.More recently, these introduced earthworms have established themselves in morenatural habitats, such as the temperate forests of North America. More often than not, their arrival in these forests has been as discarded fishing bait. There, theearthworm's tendency to bury fallen leaves and till the soil hascaused problems, severely altering the nutrient status of the soil, exposing tree roots and reducing cover for ground nesting birds.Earthworms are now viewed as invasive alien species in such ecosystems. Further north, in the boreal forests of Arctic and sub-Arctic Canada, an even greater problem is growingArctic soils are thought to storearound halfof all the carbon locked up in soil globally. The greatest risk to the carbon storage of boreal forests was always assumed to be forest fires, whichmay be increasingas a result of rising global temperatures.But earthworms may actually pose as great a threat. As land that was once covered with ice or in a semi-permanent frozen state thaws, the carbon-rich nutrients it held for thousands of years become accessible to microorganisms and soil-dwelling animals.After the last ice age, no earthworms were present in northern soils. Since these creatures spread through the earth at a rate of only10 meters per yearunder normal circumstances, even if they could survive, they wouldn't be expected to reach such regions for centuries.Heading northBut by building roads and pursuingrecreational activitieslike freshwater angling, people are accidentally transporting ecosystem-engineering earthworms into areas where recently defrosted soil awaits. Again, it is abandoned, living fishing bait that creates a new invasion front.By exercising their natural behavior, earthworms are unlocking carbon from this soil and much of it is being released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. A study published in 2015predictedaverage losses of 10g of carbon per square meter of forest floor per year—a similar figure to that released by wildfires or the removal of trees for timber.You might think earthworms would struggle to survive Arctic winters, but some, such as the octagonal worm (Dendrobaena octaedra) are relatively freeze-tolerant and their eggs cansurvive temperatures of -35°C. Others, such as the lobworm, can burrow deep to survive freezing temperatures above. Such species, once established, are not easily eradicated.In these newly available soils, earthworms are interacting with a range of microorganisms and enabling them to more easily decompose plant matter which waspreviously locked up in ice, generating large volumes of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases in the process.This creates a positive feedback loop as the further release of greenhouse gases accelerates temperature rise. This is probably an unstoppable process and the best action with respect to earthworms is to prevent their accidental introduction at further sites in the sub-Arctic through education and, potentially, the policing of recreational areas.Earthworms are vital in most soils, but in extremely northern latitudes, a massive shift has occurred in our view of these exceptional animals. Globally, we—thegeneral public, governments, industry and scientists—must begin to address the issues of theclimate crisisthat affect us, earthworms, and indeed all living things on Earth."

Are events like thesedestined to become more frequent?As experts in disturbance dynamics occurring in the boreal environment, we are assessing the fires that occurred in Québec in 2023 to provide insights into their causes and consequences.Millions of hectares affectedAccording to Québec'sSociété de protection des forêts contre le feu(Society for the protection of forests againstfire, SOPFEU), nearly 700 fires have burned approximately 5.1 million hectares (equivalent to the territory size of Costa Rica), both north and south of the northernforestlimit designated by the province—or the boundary that separates northern Québec forests from the southern forests, where logging is conducted.At the beginning of October, fifteen of the fires that had started in the summer were still active in western Québec. Three of them, although contained, had burned a total of almost 700,000 hectares within theintensive protection zone, where the SOPFEU systematically fights all fires.In thenorthern zone, twelve fires were still under surveillance, some not exceeding 20 hectares, others covering more than a million hectares. Out of the total area burned in 2023 in Québec, three-quarters (3.8 million hectares) were in the northern zone. South of the 50th parallel, within the intensive protection zone, approximately 1.4 million hectares burned, which is more than 80 times the annual average of the past ten years.When we compare the 2023 fire season todatasets available since the 1970s, it becomes quite clear that this year was unusual compared to recent decades. Yet, although these fires are impressive and difficult to contain, they are still within the range of ""natural variability"" observed in previous centuries.Severalstudieshave shown that particularly intense fire cycles were common in Québec during the period from 1910 to 1920. These were even more common in the 18th and 19th centuries when warm and dry climatic conditions were particularly conducive to forest fires.Exceptional weather conditionsLike historic forest fires, fire outbreaks in Québec in 2023 were fueled byintense weather conditions. Starting in June, after an already dry month of May, a significant increase in fires was observed in the intensive protection zone. The northern zone was affected throughout the three summer months.These fires were mainly started by lightning. Their spread was then exacerbated by low precipitation and abnormally high temperatures.Temperatures exceeded the 1981-2010 average for the month of June by 2.3°C, setting a record for the warmest June recorded in Québec in at least a hundred years.These exceptional weather conditions were partly influenced by the El Niño phenomenon, a cyclical warming of the Pacific Ocean known for its impact on terrestrial weather conditions. The trend continued into July, which witnessed exceptionally high average temperatures, well above normal (+2.7°C).Multiple consequencesThe simultaneous outbreak of numerous fires and their rapid spread have had multiple effects on wildlife, forests, the climate, and human populations.The fires have altered the structure and composition of vegetation, causing disruption to wildlife habitats as well asdisplacement and mortality among animals. As a result, the hunting, fishing and harvesting territories of Indigenous communities have been affected.In addition to representing a direct threat topublic safety, the smoke from the fires causedrespiratory problems, leading tothe evacuation of thousands of people in several regions of Québec. The deterioration in air quality was felt not only across Canada and theUnited States, but also as far asEurope. Fortunately, evacuations were carried out in time, and casualties were avoided. However, there was some material damage.In terms of their impact on the climate, large fires released several megatons of carbon dioxide stored in trees and soils,contributing to an increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases(CO2, CH4).While the fires have had significant consequences, they can sometimes be beneficial for certain organisms. We can considertree specieslike jack pine, which depend on fires for regeneration, and numerous animal species that thrive in burned forests.What can we expect in the future?Québec's forests have been burning and regenerating cyclically for millennia. However, it is imperative to recognize that these cycles can evolve over time.The 2023 fire season highlights the urgency of preparing for significant changes in disturbance dynamics, including the possibility of such events recurring more frequently.Asclimate changeprogresses, periods of drought could become more frequent if precipitation fails to compensate for rising temperatures, as observed in the 20th century.This combination of factors increases the likelihood of an increase in the number, size, and intensity of wildfires.Such changes threaten the natural regeneration of forests and could lead to the formation of treeless areas, victims of too frequent firesfor vegetation to have time to regenerate.These conditions could also be exacerbated by the continued expansion of logging.Preliminary analyseshave shown that more than 300,000 hectares of forests burned in 2023 may not regenerate, mainly due to the effects of logging in recent decades.The consequences of major forest fires highlight the climate challenges we face. They demonstrate the need to develop mitigation and adaptation measures aimed at protecting vulnerable forest ecosystems and their inhabitants.It is therefore imperative to learn lessons from the 2023 fire season to strengthen the resilience of forests and communities to climate change and limit damages caused by fires. This involves reducing risk, protecting the most vulnerable areas, and raising awareness among local populations."

The projection comes as heat-related deaths of adults over 65 have increased by 85% since the 1990s, according to the annualLancet Countdown on Health and Climate Changereport. The hottest global temperatures in over 100,000 years were recorded in 2023 with the planet currently at 1.14°C of global heating, the report says. Increasing global temperatures are linked to environmental changes like melting Arctic ice caps, drought and heat waves, and more intense hurricanes and wildfires. These stark changes are more than just ecological concerns; they also significantly impact human health, the report stressed. This new Lancet report comes the same day asthe new White House climate report, which flagged that climate-related hazards such as extreme heat, drought, and wildfires will continue to grow and directly impact human health. There were on average 86 days of health-threatening high temperatures in 2018-2022, according to the Lancet report. Human-caused climate change made more than 60% of those days more likely to have happened, the analysis showed. ""We're already seeing climate change claiming lives or livelihoods in every part of the world. The impacts are happening here and now,"" said Marina Romanello, the executive director of the Lancet Countdown and a climate change and health researcher at University College London, during a press briefing. Droughts and heatwaves are increasing globally, leading to food insecurity and water scarcity, according to the researchers. There has been a 29% increase in areas of extreme drought since the 1950s. Around 127 million more people said that they experienced significant food insecurity in 2021 than annually between 1981 and 2010. The report also warned that warming ocean temperatures are enabling the spread of the Vibrio bacteria, which can cause serious illness and death if people swim in water with open wounds or eat raw or contaminated seafood. The coastline area suitable for Vibrio bacteria around the world has increased every year by 329 square kilometers since 1982, putting around 1.4 billion more people at risk of diarrheal disease, severe wound infections and sepsis by 2022. ""Climate breakdown has begun, and humanity is staring down the barrel of an intolerable future. We are already seeing a human catastrophe unfolding with the health and livelihoods of billions across the world endangered by record-breaking heat, crop-failing droughts, rising levels of hunger, growing infectious disease outbreaks, and deadly storms and floods,"" said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres in response to the Lancet report. The Paris Agreement, the international treaty on climate change, calls for the world to keep global warming to well below 2-degrees Celsius, with the aim of limiting the increase to 1.5-degrees Celsius. The new report found that under the 2-degree warming scenario, there would be 525 million additional people experiencing significant food insecurity by 2031-2060. There would be 23–39% more cases of infection with Vibrio bacteria under the 2-degree warming scenario. There would also be a 37% increase in the spread of dengue, a mosquito-borne illness that can be life threatening, the report says. ""Continued warming could lead to those patterns spiraling out of control,"" Romanello said to the projections outlined in the report. The researchers behind the report say that there needs to be urgent action on climate change to mitigate the health impacts.

A long running effort to permanently boost pay for thousands of federal wildland firefighters appears to be gaining some traction in Congress. But fire managers warn it could be too little too late to prevent mass resignations in the coming weeks. The House earlier this month passed an amendment extending a temporary pay increase of $20,000 approved by President Biden through next year. While a broader bill in the Senate that would make those pay bumps permanent remains stalled, it appears the latest stopgap budget deal averting a government shutdown will also avert - for now — a massive pay cut many firefighters feared was coming by Friday. ""Basically this is like a band aid. It's not a fix. We need a fix,"" says Mike Alba, a union organizer and engine captain on the Los Padres National Forest. Rookie federal firefighters on the front lines of America's wildfire crisis only make about $15 hour, up from $13 an hour after President Biden approved a temporary pay bump in 2021. Funds from the infrastructure law later went on to give many federal firefighters a $20,000 boost to their salaries — a typical base salary for a year round entry level firefighter is only $34,000. In the wildland firefighting world right now, Congress's budget dysfunctions are a big distraction for firefighters, according to Tom Dillon, a captain for the Alpine Hot Shots, an elite federal firefighting crew based in Rocky Mountain National Park. Dillon says his teams are all talking about the future of their paychecks when they should be focusing on firefighting tactics and training and keeping communities safe. ""It's kind of a slap in the face,"" Dillon says. ""The folks on Capitol Hill, some of them aren't even aware of who we are and what we do and that there is a federal wildland firefighting workforce."" There are an estimated 17,000 federal wildland firefighters. Most are like Mike Alba and work for the U.S. Forest Service. Alba says crews are burdened by increasingly hazardous and dangerous work, flattening overtime pay and growing mental health challenges. For Alba, the one time pay bump is a lifeline. ""For myself, I'm able to spend time with my kids more,"" he says. Now that the U.S. House appears to have narrowly averted another government shutdown, Alba will likely keep his higher pay, but only until early January unless Congress acts to make the 2021 pay boost permanent. But morale is low. Three guys on his engine alone have quit for higher pay and better benefits for nearby city and state agencies. He doesn't blame them. ""They give us a little bit of taste, like, 'hey, we want you guys to stay.' Now it's, 'oh you know, we might not give it to you,'"" Alba says. ""We are worth the squeeze."" The union representing federal employees is warning that, based on its surveys, at least thirty percent of the federal wildland firefighting force could quit if pay isn't permanently boosted. Meanwhile, climate and forest management issues are only making wildfires more severe and deadly. In Colorado, Tom Dillon says the recent fixes are only band-aids. And the continued budget impasse is already affecting recruitment for next year. ""They are looking for things like work life balance. They are looking for things like time off. They are looking to not live in vans any longer,"" Dillon says."

She sets the tufted bundle down with intention to start the first of three new fires within a two-acre garden.Minutes before, Eliud Rios attached a bright yellow bag to his back—a bladder full of water. In his hand, he wields a metal water hose. Acting as a watcher, the urban forester holds the flames at bay, keeping the fire contained to the desired acreage and plants, spilling water out onto the redbud trees.Rios listens intently to Almendariz, who is leading this cultural burn at the nonprofit Cache Creek Conservancy in Woodland, California. It was the first of a three-day workshop for the public and fire professionals discussing Indigenous ways of environmental stewardship, teaching cultural sensitivity and burn practices.""When we wet the shrub, we let the fire know where we want it,"" Almendariz, of Maidu and Wintun heritage, said. ""Fire is living; it can be worked with.""While a controlled or prescribed burn is used for wildfire management, cultural burns sit at a lower intensity, don't use man-made chemicals for ignition, and often focus on the regrowth of native plants.It's an effort that requires many hands. Cultural practitioner Danny Manning of the Native American Mountain Maidu community built the small campfire that served as Almendariz's source for lighting the tule bundles. He rubbed a wooden stick and plank together until an ember formed. With a helper, he tended the fire until Almendariz started the fire spreading ceremony.Cultural burning on these lands at Cache Creek returned about five years ago. In that time, practitioners and land stewards have strategically promoted basketry plants for weaving, like tule, and managed the spread of coyote brush, which can choke out neighboring vegetation. Despite fire's natural destruction, many plants native to the state are fire adaptive, and some require extreme heat for seed generation. These fires promote rebirth.The conservancy's Tending and Gathering Garden, where Almendariz started the fire, also supports redbud, willow, deergrass and sedge under the guidance of a Native steering committee. The demonstration garden honors the Wintun's Patwin in this local watershed, focusing on how these tribes hunted, fished and gathered from the land and water.Leok Po—(pronounced lay-oak poe) in the Wintun language meaning ""Good Fire""—served as the theme of the weekend. Friday's burns were limited to three small fires in the garden of the nature preserve.""It's not how much you get done, it's the quality and being with the land,"" said Manning, who is also a local firefighter.This past weekend's workshops mimicked a pilot event last year. This year, the workshop expanded to three days, with two specifically for fire professionals, like Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation Fire Chief Shawn Kinney, who stood watch at Friday's burn.Throughout Saturday and Sunday, Kinney and his team participated in burns on thefiredepartment's own tribal lands. This, he said, would provide a more in-depth, cross-pollination of knowledge that can be used in the future.""If we can learn this, it can be part of the model,"" Kinney said.In 2022, Cal Fire's ""Strategic Plan for Expanding the Use of Beneficial Fire"" acknowledged a renewed interest in using Native American methods of cultural burns for forest sustainability. A year before that, the state passed legislation promoting private burn bosses, supported by Native American tribes and experts.While controlled buns thin vegetation and overall hazards ahead of time, they often don't take into account for more specific future desires for the land and plants. Cultural burns, Indigenous Education Coordinator Clint McKay can serve more narrow, and even more broad desires.""What makes it cultural is how and why we're doing it,"" McKay said.Last year, McKay led the first cultural burn in more than 200 years at Pepperwood Fields. McKay's grandchildren participated in the event, making them the first Indigenous stewards of those lands in seven generations.Here at the conservancy, Almendiaz wants to eventually regrow the tule to be strong enough to weave a boat. It'll take routine fires clearing the old tule with new forging tougher bushels, she said, and a commitment.""We're not burning to get rid of the extra fuel,"" Almendiaz reiterated. ""We're burning to take care of the plants.""2023 The Sacramento Bee.

The research highlights a focus on ‘Super Bundling’ — a model that provides integrated management of subscriptions through a centralized content hub, delivered through aggregators like telcos. With data from over 100 executives across leading music, video, and multi-service content providers, the study shows widespread endorsement of the Super Bundling model. This model is already a key growth strategy with telcos, as exemplified by offerings such as Optus SubHub and Verizon +play content hub, which bring together dozens of subscription services. Explaining the rationale behind the subscription industry’s push towards Super Bundling, over two-thirds of subscription leaders say ‘new customer acquisition’ (73%) is a high priority, closely followed by ‘reducing churn’ (68%). The road ahead The research shows that subscription providers have identified several key opportunities in Super Bundling, while emphasizing that time is of the essence. More than three out of five subscription leaders agree that: Over half of these executives (53%) already say Super Bundling will play a vital role in their future customer acquisition and retention strategies. Some go as far to say thatnotpursuing Super Bundling could be damaging, with almost a third (31%) warning of potential revenue and market share loss for those that don’t adapt quickly enough. When deciding who to select as their bundling partners, communications service providers dominate, with 60% of subscription leaders citing satellite/cable providers as most effective, followed by broadband (56%) and cell phone companies (56%). Technical roadblocks While keenly aware of the opportunities of Super Bundling, subscription leaders also point to challenges implementing the model. Three out of five (61%) report that their core challenge when bundling subscriptions isthe complexity of managing multiple partners. When trying to achieve this through reseller partners such as telcos, more than half report that the top challenges they face in partnering effectively are: Back to the future To overcome the technical challenges of Super Bundling, subscription services need access to specialized technology and infrastructure. Even for those who have the basic tools required to support bundling, building a unified user experience that brings together multiple vendor subscriptions can be complex and costly.

""Even in places like the Northwest, wherethere are firesthat are almost adjacent to the farms, they have little or no impact on the trees,"" he said. ""Smoke-filled skies decrease sunlight and reduce photosynthesis, but to a small degree and temporarily,"" Steve Reiners, Cornell University horticulturist,wrote over the summer,specifically referring to garden vegetables. ""Despite the shade, there is still enough diffused light penetrating the smoke to maintain growth."" The National Christmas Tree Association, a trade group that represents growers, put outa statementsaying, ""Supplies of real farm-grown trees have been tight since 2016, but each year shoppers have been able to find a tree."" ""There's quite a bit of talk — again, internet and media and so forth — about a Christmas tree shortage,"" Cregg said. ""That's not really a thing."" Cregg said he searched YouTube and found news reports of shortages going back at least a decade. Areportin 2014 blamed less demand during the 2008 and 2009 recession for fewer Christmas trees. Individual farms can and will sell out, though. ""They can't sell everything this year and have nothing next year,"" Cregg said. He suggested calling ahead before you go to ensure your retailer of choice still has trees. TheChristmas tree industrydoes face a variety of challenges, from the climate crisis to fewer growers. ""It used to be you could find tree lot right next door, but more of that is people aging out,"" Greg Hann of the Wisconsin Christmas Tree Producers Association toldThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. He noted that some younger people are taking up the mantle in that state, though. While smoke may not harm evergreens, theflames from wildfirescan destroy them. Recent droughts haveimpacted individual growers. There are also pests and diseases that growers have to contend with. Whitehill said growers in some areas have to plant Fraser firs, one of the US's most popular trees, at higher elevationsto avoida destructiveroot rotfungus. ""Of course, at some point, you start to run out of mountain,"" he said. ""And so that's kind of a challenge we see on the horizon."" But for this year, Cregg recommended getting your tree early if there's a species you really prefer, or maybe try branching out. ""If you've always had a noble, maybe it's time to look at a Turkish,"" he said. ""People may need to be a little more willing to substitute to look for a different type of tree."""

Smoke from the fires produced repeated severe air quality alerts and even evacuations in many locations.But it was not known how far beyond Canada and the northern US such dangerous air pollution had reached, and even within North America, the understanding of the dispersal of the most harmful pollutants was limited.""There were photographs from New York City in July in news outlets around the world that showed the city trapped in an almost unbreathable orange haze like something out of a dystopian movie,"" said Zhe Wang, lead author of the study and a researcher with the State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics at Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) of Chinese Academy of Sciences.""But what we know about long-range transport of particulate matter means that the fires likely impacted Europe and Asia as well. We just didn't know to what extent.""So Dr. Wang and other researchers from IAP set out to calculate the full global reach of this threat to public health by using numerical air quality model models. Similar to climate models, air quality models use mathematical techniques to simulate how weather and chemical reactions impact the dispersal of air pollutants.For this work, the IAP scientists used the Aerosol and Atmospheric Chemistry Model of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP-AACM), a computer model developed in house as a module within the broader Chinese Academy of Sciences Earth System Model (CAS-ESM).The researchers found that while Canada was most severely affected, almost the whole of the northern hemisphere was subject to marked significant declines in air quality due to long-range wind transport of pollutants.There were six main widespread air pollution episodes over the course of Canada's wildfire 'season': May 15-22, June 5-9, June 24-July 1, July 12-19, August 17-15, and August 17-22. In addition to Canada itself, the first such episode affected air quality in the central northern parts of the US. The second episode impacted the northeastern US, and particularly badly.The model results here match real-world observations. The concentration of fine particles with diameters of 2.5 microns or less (termed PM2.5—the particulate matter that is most dangerous, as compared to larger but less harmful particles with a diameter of 10 microns, or PM10) on June 7 was found by 11 monitoring sites in New York City to have reached the worst air quality level for more than 50 years.During the third main episode of severe air pollution, the model suggested that PM2.5 pollutants were transported to Europe, while the fourth such episode concentrated its severest presence in western Canada and the central northern US once again. The fifth episode mainly affected northern Canada, while the sixth episode affected both western and eastern coast regions of the U.S.. Due to the northward movement of the wildfires, high concentrations of PM2.5 were transported to the Arctic region over the course of the mid and late summer.PM2.5 concentrations higher than the World Health Organization air-quality guidelines of 15 micrograms per cubic meter mainly occurred over North America, with an excess of 40 pollution days exceeding this limit over western and eastern Canada, as well as more than 10 such days over the northeastern U.S..But due to the wildfire plumes being transported by prevailing westerly winds across the Atlantic Ocean, vast swathes of Europe and western, central and east Asia suffered from increases in such concentrations. This meant that maximum PM2.5 concentrations exceeded 1 microgram per cubic meter over most areas of the Northern Hemisphere—lower than the WHO guideline but not without impact. PM2.5 concentration in the northwest region of China increased to roughly two micrograms per cubic meter.Western and eastern Canada were most severely impacted, suffering PM2.5 concentration over 150 PM2.5, some ten times the WHO maximum.While focusing on air quality, the researchers also used computer modeling to investigate the global distribution of greenhouse gases (GHGs) produced by the Canadian fires. They found that the conflagration had resulted in an increase in carbon dioxide levels mainly over North America in May, and also over Europe and northwestern Asia in June. The wildfire-related CO2concentrations exceeded 0.1 part per million (ppm) over most Northern Hemisphere areas except southeast Asia, India and southern China in July, and increased to more than 0.2 ppm in August.This increase in GHGs due to the fires has two major consequences. First, its production of enhanced warming in these regions atop existing global warming increases the likelihood of the sort of conditions that exacerbated wildfires. In other words, more wildfires means even more wildfires.Second, the level of wildfire-related greenhouse gas emissions in Canada in 2023 were more than twice the country's legislated plan for cumulative reductions in human-caused GHGs over the next ten years.""Canada's 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan has been wiped out by a single year of wildfires,"" said Zifa Wang, corresponding author of the study."

A book about an inferno that ravaged a Canadian city and has been called a portent of climate chaos has won Britain's leading nonfiction book prize. LONDON — A book about a fire that ravaged a Canadian city and has been called a portent of climate chaos won Britain's leading nonfiction book prize on Thursday. John Vaillant'sFire Weather: A True Story from a Hotter Worldwas awarded the 50,000 pound ($62,000) Baillie Gifford Prize at a ceremony in London. The chairperson of the judging panel, Frederick Studemann, said the book tells ""a terrifying story,"" reading ""almost like a thriller"" with a ""deep science backdrop."" He calledFire Weather, which was also aU.S. National Book Awardfinalist, ""an extraordinary and elegantly rendered account of a terrifying climate disaster that engulfed a community and industry, underscoring our toxic relationship with fossil fuels."" Vaillant, based in British Columbia, recounts how a huge wildfire engulfed the oil city of Fort McMurray in 2016. The blaze, which burned for months, drove 90,000 people from their homes, destroyed 2,400 buildings and disrupted work at Alberta's lucrative polluting oil sands. Vaillant said the lesson he took from the inferno was that ""fire is different now, and we've made it different"" through human-driven climate change. He said the day the fire broke out in early May, it was 33 degrees Celsius (91.4 degrees Fahrenheit) in Fort McMurray, which is about 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) south of the Arctic Circle. Humidity was a bone-dry 11%. ""You have to go to Death Valley in July to get 11% humidity,"" Vaillant told The Associated Press. ""Now transpose those conditions to the boreal forest, which is already flammable. To a petroleum town, which is basically built from petroleum products — from the vinyl siding to the tar shingles to the rubber tires to the gas grills. ... So those houses burned like a refinery."" Vaillant said the fire produced radiant heat of 500 Celsius — ""hotter than Venus."" Canada has experienced many devastating fires since 2016. The country endured itsworst wildfire season on record this year, with blazes destroying huge swaths of northern forest andblanketing much of Canada and the U.S. in haze. ""That has grave implications for our future,"" Vaillant said. ""Canadians are forest people, and the forest is starting to mean something different now. Summer is starting to mean something different now. That's profound, It's like a sci-fi story — when summer became an enemy."" Founded in 1999, the prize recognizes English-language books from any country in current affairs, history, politics, science, sport, travel, biography, autobiography and the arts. It has been credited with bringing an eclectic slate of fact-based books to a wider audience. Vaillant beat five other finalists including best-selling American author David Grann's seafaring yarnThe Wagerand physician-writer Siddhartha Mukherjee'sThe Song of the Cell. Sponsor Baillie Gifford, an investment firm, has faced protests from environmental groups over its investments in fossil fuel businesses. Last year's prize winner, Katherine Rundell, gave her prize money forSuper-Infinite: The Transformations of John Donneto a conservation charity. The judges said neither the sponsor nor criticism of it influenced their deliberations. Historian Ruth Scurr, who was on the panel, said she did not feel ""compromised"" as a judge of the prize. ""I have no qualms at all about being an independent judge on a book prize, and I am personally thrilled that the winner is going to draw attention to this subject,"" she said."

While bothguildswere able to secure guardrails surrounding the uses ofAIin their latest contracts with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, Bateman — who is a former member of the SAG board and negotiating committee — thinks the actors union didn’t go far enough.Related StoriesExecutivesDavid Zaslav Says Studios Overpaid To End WGA Strike; Scribes Deal Valued At $700MBelow The Line2023-24 Awards Season Calendar - Dates For Oscars, Emmys, Grammys, Tonys, Guilds & More SAG-AFTRA’s 118-day strike came to an end last week, when the studios finally struck a deal with the guild. While the ratification vote started this week, the union has yet to release the full tentative MBA. Instead, they releaseda detailed summary of the contract, which includes extensive language about how the studios can and cannot use AI to replace actors or alter their performances. Since then, Bateman has pointed out several concerns with the AI portion of the summary, including how the use of “synthetic performers” has the potential to replace living actors as well as how consent will (or won’t) be obtained to use digital replicas of real performers. “I think generative AI is one of the worst ideas we’ve ever had in this society,” Bateman told Deadline during a recent interview in which she discusses the shortcomings of the current deal on the table and the longterm potential impacts of generative AI. SAG-AFTRA has encouraged members to attend informational sessions and ask clarifying questions of their leadership before the ratification voting deadline on December 5. Many of the concerns brought forth during these sessions have been about AI. The guild’s National Executive Director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland told Deadline today, “It does make me feel good to have those dialogues” ahead of the vote. “While I recognize that there are people who have questions, doubts, or even concerns about the contract, I feel very confident that this contract is the absolute best deal that could be obtained in this negotiation, that the protections against the use of AI are very strong, and while they can definitely be improved and will be in future rounds of bargaining, that they provide the kind of core protection that our members expect,” he said. “And in recognition of the fact that we can’t stop the advance of technology and can channel that into the right direction….I think our members at large see that there are huge gains in this contract that are unprecedented and that just put us in a position to further advance our members interests in the next round of bargaining and beyond.” Read Bateman’s interview below. DEADLINE: Have you read the actual MBA, or just the summary that SAG-AFTRA has put out publicly? JUSTINE BATEMAN:I have read the AI portion of it. But I didn’t really need to, to point out what I pointed out. The summary is fairly detailed. You can also go off some of the things that have been said by Duncan [Crabtree-Ireland] in interviews. I mean, the information is available. DEADLINE: Sure, but I’ve seen some chatter among members wishing they could read the actual agreement before they vote on ratification. BATEMAN:I mentioned to Duncan that might be a good idea. He said it won’t be ready in time. But I said that one portion, you could probably make available. It’s very concerning for people, because it’s the first time they’ve had to deal with those kinds of permissions and allowances. Everything else, like rate changes, they’re areas that they or their representatives are familiar with. But this is an area that is very new for everybody, and is an existential area on top of that. So anyway, they’ll do what they’re going to do, but it might be helpful for them, because people want to know, and they can take it to their lawyers instead of [SAG-AFTRA] having to answer all the questions, one by one, themselves. DEADLINE: Do you think this AI issue is going to make or break the ratification vote? BATEMAN:I don’t know. I don’t know if it’s going to be ratified or not. My focus for the last nine months has just been to tell people what is coming. That’s all. I’m not advocating for people to vote one way or the other. I just think it’s inhuman and cruel to not tell people what they’re walking into, to not tell people where the loopholes are. If you’ve been in the business long enough, you know we’ll be exploited. At some point, they absolutely will be exploited, and [they] will have to live with that fallout. So understanding what that fallout is, and then deciding for yourself. These are intelligent adults, most of them. I mean, most of them are adults, some of them are kids. But these are intelligent people, members of the Screen Actors Guild, and they can make up their own mind. I don’t have to tell them. I’m just the mailman. I didn’t write the letter. I’m just saying, ‘Here’s what’s in the letter, and here’s what can be done with what’s in the letter.’ That’s all. If they want to be mad at somebody, they can be mad at theAMPTP. They can be mad at the people who insisted or negotiated these terms, which is the replacement of human actors with something that looks human. DEADLINE: I want to get your take on the exceptions to consent laid out in the summary, which seem pretty wide ranging. Specifically, post-production alterations. BATEMAN:Well, I don’t know that there’s an exemption for post-production. I mean, there’s an exemption if it’s very similar to what was already scripted, which can be wildly interpreted and widely interpreted depending on someone’s opinion of what type of character the actor is playing. But the biggest issue is the ‘synthetic performers,’ which I just call human looking AI objects, because they’re not performers. Having that in there would be like if the Teamsters said that it’s okay to use self driving trucks instead of them. Or, it would be like the DGA not having the definition of a director or any of the other positions being human, that you could have a director that’s just a generative AI base. It would be like the WGA saying it’s okay if chatGPT authors full scripts. That’s what that is, and I’ve maintained from the very beginning, when I started talking to actors about what would happen, that’s the key to the front door. You can do all these renovations in the house. You can get all these other gains in the contract. But if you don’t get that, if you don’t get control of what they can do without you based on 100 years of performances…you put in a prompt and you get out this Frankenstein amalgamation of performances. I said that if you don’t get that, you’ve given them the front key to the house, because it’s not just the actors. It’s the crew, it’s the drivers, it’s everybody. If you don’t have to shoot an actor, you don’t need a set. You don’t need a crew. You don’t need drivers. DEADLINE: It seems like monetary damages is going to be members’ sole recourse in most cases for violation of the AI portion of the MBA. Are you worried about that, considering the studios have never seemed to be deterred by any sort of fines in the past? BATEMAN:Well, this is true of all large corporations. Fine payments don’t seem to deter them a lot. DEADLINE: So, do you think there should be another actionable way for actors to be able to fight any violations? BATEMAN:The weird thing about these negotiations, the AI section of it is like negotiating with cannibals. You shouldn’t be talking about cutting off your feet at all. But the conversation becomes just, ‘ How are we going to remove your feet? And will we be grilling them or boiling them? And what kind of sauce are we going to put on them?’ So I’m not the one to talk to you about the best way to compensate someone if they if they see their ‘digital double’ in something. I’m not an actor anymore. But you know, if I was, I would say I’m going to be scan free. I don’t know. That’s just me personally. I mean, as a filmmaker, I’ll never use generative AI. I’m going to use humans. It’s been done for 100 years, and it’s good enough for me. DEADLINE: As you talk about this online, what are the responses you’ve been getting from members? BATEMAN:Oh, I mean, many people are just really grateful to have it explained to them in plain language. I’m glad to have this combination of expertise, the computer science degree and also years ago, I was on the SAG board and was on the SAG negotiating committee. I’m also writer and producer and a director. I’ve been combing through contracts for over 40 years, and it’s a really great combination of assets to have at this moment in time. I’m just letting them know what these terms mean. I said things before this agreement came out at all. I’m still saying the same thing. I didn’t need to look at. The SAG negotiations didn’t even need to start for me to know what the studios wanted to do with actors. I think because the bottom line is this is fueled by abject greed, and when studio and streaming CEOs are looking at an opportunity to reduce the overhead of our human labor to such an extent that they’re paying a fraction of the cost to make these films and could possibly make the same amount in box office. To imagine that they’re not going to go for that is very naive. You always know what people are either already doing or are going to do by what they asked for in a negotiation. And now we see it, things that I’ve said way back before the negotiations even started. DEADLINE: What’s the solution? Whether that be amending this contract or in the negotiations three years from now, how can the MBA better protect actors? BATEMAN:Well, in order to keep the profession alive at all… that synthetic performer sh*t has to come out. I told you the equivalents in the other unions. The Screen Actors Guild represents human performers, and when you have a clause in the MBA that allows for something else to take those parts, I’m not sure. I mean, it’s supposed to be of service to the members that are in that union. Synthetic AI objects are not in the Screen Actors Guild. There’s also going to be big financial ramifications for the union itself when they use those objects. That’s an object. That’s not a person, not going to be paid, not paying dues to the union, you’re not going to have pension and health contributions, on behalf of that object. I know it says in there that they’d negotiate consideration, but it doesn’t even say financial consideration, unless they add that word. So how are you going to force the studios to pay you something? That’s the biggest problem. And people say like, ‘Oh, that will never happen.’ It’s like, we’re not talking aboutPolar Expressfrom like, what was it? 20 years ago? They can go to Credo23.com and the ‘AI and film’ page, and it lists all the things that I believe will happen in the business. There are hyperlinks to all these video demos, and they could just look at that and decide for themselves. DEADLINE: Earlier this week, Fran Drescher called those criticizing the contract ‘naysayers’ and ‘contrarians.’ How do you feel about that, considering you’ve been so outspoken about this? BATEMAN:I just feel what I felt for the last nine months. I love this business. I love everyone who is called to this business. I think it’s important that they have an understanding of what was coming and is here now and will be coming more so in the future. I just think it’s important to let people know that they can make up their own minds about whatever they want to do, whether it’s ratification or what they want to do professionally in two years when this is all, you know. There’s some things that are going to happen to actors that don’t have that much to do with the MBA, like…the odds of you booking a job. Ted Sarandos had a great quote once. He’s talking about movie releases, and he says, ‘It used to be that your movie would compete with just what was in the theaters at that time, that weekend, that month, whatever. Now, you’re going to be competing with every film that’s ever been released, because it’s available online.’ In that same sense, actors used to audition against all the other actors that were their age and their type, that were available, that weren’t busy on another film. It’s somewhat of a finite number of people, and it was hard to get a job already. Now, what’s going to happen to these actors is they’ll be competing against that group, and digital doubles of all the all the actors who are alive, who were busy or not. Maybe it’s a role for someone who’s 25 years old? Well, Tom Cruise can have a scan of himself and have a version of himself that’s 25. So no matter what the age of the actors who are alive right now, you’re competing against them, and you’re competing against 100 years worth of actors that their estates or the union gave permission — which that’s a crazy kind of concept. Anyway, you’re competing against all the dead actors, too, and you’re competing against an unlimited number of synthetic AI objects. So the percentage of jobs a human is going to have now are going to be much smaller than they were before. DEADLINE: What do you say to anyone who says that having any guardrails on AI is a start, and there’s always another negotiation in three years? BATEMAN:Well, let’s look at what’s happened in six months. This is a tech that gets exponentially better, even while we were doing this interview, and while you’re sleeping. This isn’t a tech where it gets better as the humans who are using it get better. This isn’t like old school Photoshop or something. So this is getting exponentially better. Three years. I mean, we should be thinking about the incredible changes we’re going to see in the next three months. Three months, not three years. I don’t think any one union is going to have a leverage to do any bargaining at all in two and a half years. That’s why, I don’t know how practical it is, but I wish IATSE, Teamsters, WGA, DGA and SAG could all be on the same cycle. So that all together, we could have some leverage. Look, the whole structure of the business is this pipeline of labor from conception to release and promotion. When you start taking out chunks of that pipeline, you’re gonna collapse the structure of it. That’s just kind of business physics, and that’s what’s going to happen here. They’re gonna collapse the structure. Even if you didn’t have the synthetic AI objects, just the digital double thing alone. I get it, there’s protections — consent and compensation. But how much can you shoot with a digital double? You’re probably not using a set, if you’re doing that. So even if it’s just for second unit, you got lots of people on second unit crews that have made a living that way. Now, they’re eliminated. I mean, that’s just in the smallest sense of it. Then you go a little bigger, and you’re like, alright, well, there’s a film [starring] Bradley Cooper, but we’re using his digital double. So the shooting schedule now, instead of it being two months, is only three weeks, because we don’t need to shoot all the stuff that he’s going to be in because that’ll be done through generative AI. So even with all the protections, and even if there were no loopholes, and you took out the synthetic performers, you’re still going to have these issues. DEADLINE: You mentioned the amount of human actors who could lose out on jobs simply because of the use of generative AI, but you also said that if you were still acting you’d go scan-free. There doesn’t appear to be any language prohibiting scans from being a condition of employment, though. So refusing to get a scan could also cost someone a job. BATEMAN:That’s a good point. They’ll have to do their homework first and really be able to spell out how those scans will be used, instead of it being a hand wavy, ‘Oh, just for second unit stuff.’ I don’t know. There’s so many questions, because [what if] there’s a leak and all those digital doubles get out there? DEADLINE: You also mentioned on social media the idea of a company selling their assets or going out of business. BATEMAN:It’ll be seen as an asset, just like a copyrighted film is one of your assets. Amazon didn’t buy MGM just for the name. They bought the library. This is actors really being commoditized, big time. It’s a shame. It’s very insulting to the art form of acting. The whole concept of using generative AI in the film business at all, I think, is offensive and it’s insulting to filmmakers, from actors to the grips to everybody. It’s really sad. I think we’re gonna have some great things on the other side of it, but there’s going to be a collapsing inferno before that. DEADLINE: What can actors, and other filmmakers, do about it now then? BATEMAN:Oh, I would say this to actors, crew members, anybody — make as much money as you can the next two, three years. Seek out filmmakers who are doing human films and tell them you want to work with them. And like, hold on, because on the other side, after everything burns down, I think there’ll be a new genre in film. Something really new in the way that jazz was new, rock ‘n’ roll was new when they first started, or the flapper era. It wasn’t a throwback to something else. It was really new. So I think that’s what will happen, but it’ll be a pretty bad before that. DEADLINE: I saw a video you shared, it was Zendaya talking about the importance of reading contracts. It essentially sums up what you’re talking about, that it’s not new for companies to look for loopholes. BATEMAN:Absolutely, and if you’ve been in the business long enough, like I said earlier, you have had experiences where where you had a contract where there were loopholes and allowances that maybe you didn’t notice. Or maybe you did notice, and maybe you crossed your fingers and hoped they wouldn’t exploit that, and then you had an experience or two where they did. You made a mental note to never have those loopholes in your contract again. Like best efforts. I mean, everybody who has been around long enough, they know best efforts mean means no effort. It means the answer’s no, but we don’t have big argument with you about it. We’ll make our best efforts to get you tickets to a screening or something, and sometimes they do. But it’s like no guarantees. Some companies, they’re just not going to try at all. Listen, the other side knows what the language means. They’ve know from having contractual conflicts over the years. They know what they can get away with. They know what is absolutely a loophole, like best efforts is a loophole. So when they say in the agreement, they’ll make best efforts for dead performers to get their consent to use a digital double of them, they’ll make best efforts to reach the [estate], if they’re unable they’ll go to SAG and get permission. And I just go, okay, that could mean a cursory Google search for heirs and didn’t find any. So we go to the union, get permission, and then who exactly at the union is going to give permission? Maybe somebody’s relative is around, but the studio didn’t put in enough effort to find them, and the first time you see your mom, or your grandparents, or somebody up on the screen…we heard it recently with Robin Williams, his daughter. She’s not in control of his estate, but whoever it is gave permission for him to be involved in some project, and she was mortified. In all areas, not just entertainment, it’s really gonna mess with people’s heads. That’s not specific to this agreement, but I was hoping that the union could carve out at least a lane for human actors to go through this, like the DGA and WGA were able to do. DEADLINE: Why do you think they didn’t? They just weren’t able to, or they aren’t seeing things from the same perspective?How did we get here? BATEMAN:They did the job they did. I’m not interested in criticizing the leadership. There are a lot of things I would have done, which is neither here nor there right now. What could have been done differently? There’s a lot in my opinion, but I wasn’t lead negotiator. I’m not going to criticize them, but I do think what’s important is making sure the members understand what the loopholes and allowances are, at the very least, so they can get their own agents and lawyers to fill in those gaps. They’ll have to have their own standard AI rider. In a lot of other areas, they made good gains. But in other areas, you can rely on the MBA being the floor for you. It’s just the responsible thing to do, to tell them where these where these loopholes are, and how these allowances are going to change the profession. It’s immoral not to. You can’t let them walk into these situations not knowing what the other side has been given permission to do. DEADLINE: I also wonder how much consumers will buy into the use of generative AI. Do you think there is a tipping point, where audiences are no longer interested because the use of AI is so apparent in film and TV? BATEMAN:Eventually, yeah. So I think the way it’ll go is that audiences, not cinephiles, the general audience will receive it as something different, something new. They’re so used to watching content instead of real films and series, that it’ll just seemed one step away from that. I think the streamers at the very least, will upsell them. For an extra fee, you can face replace. If you want to watchStar Wars, and you want to play a Princess Leia, put your face on Carrie Fisher’s body, that’s not something that’s covered in this [MBA], which is unfortunate, like really unfortunate, because I think it’s gonna happen a lot. Or they reskin entire casts. Like the cast fromCitizen Kane, maybe they want to repurpose that for someone who’s viewing history is mysteries that have African Americans in them or something. And so they’ll say, ‘Well,Citizen Kaneis sort of a mystery. We can repurpose that and have a whole new library of films for this person that maybe didn’t look at that film before.’ I think there’s gonna be a lot of that repurposing. They’re gonna be a lot of lawsuits. [Upselling] will target that narcissism that has roared to life because of social media. So, if they’re clever, they’ll tap into that with this. So it’ll be a novelty for a while, and then I think people start feeling sick about it. If you change the air that’s being pumped into a room and start reducing the oxygen slowly, slowly, slowly, people don’t realize what’s going on until they’re in a state where they desperately need oxygen. It seems to me that artists are a tube through which God, the universe, magic, whatever you want to call it, comes through into society. We’ve seen it, era after era, how things artists are doing change the course of things or reflect what is changing. I’s an important element in society. I think when you cut off that tube, you’re just doing this regurgitation of our past. We’ve already seen a lot of regurgitation of the 20th century, and we’re gonna see a lot more of that. It’s kind of like we’ve been doing AI by hand by doing all these reboots and sequels and everything. Now, they’ll be able to do that much faster and much quicker. But yeah, I think there’s gonna be a point where the audience goes, ‘Hey, I don’t feel good.’ And then they’ll hunger for something that is real, and I think that’ll be kind of remarkable and fantastic. DEADLINE: That’s an optimistic way to look at it. BATEMAN:Yeah, it’ll be the next chapter. It won’t be the last chapter. This whole AI Inferno, brought to you by greed. DEADLINE: As you were describing that, it almost sounded like aBlack Mirrorepisode. Do you find it ironic that there is such a killing to be made off films and series about the dangers of AI, especially amid this whole negotiation? BATEMAN:Well, there have been decades of these films, decades of them. It’s almost as if people are going, ‘Oh, wouldn’t it be amazing if that happened?’ It’s one thing to see a film, and then it ends, you see the credits and stuff. It’s another thing to have to live through it. But almost all of those films end with that. You’re coming into this dystopia, and it ends in a disturbing way. That’s it. But I don’t think that’s how it’s gonna go for us. I think it’s gonna get really ugly, but then there’s going to be something remarkable on the other side that probably couldn’t have happened without the fire. We’re gonna have Noah’s flood, but eventually, the bird is going to come back with the olive branch in his mouth, and we’re going to have something incredible."

Director Eli Roth’s new horror-comedy,Thanksgiving, ends as all slasher movies should: With a few last-minute twists. Its third act follows the film’s protagonist, Jessica (Nell Verlaque), as she escapes a horrifying dinner party massacre orchestrated byThanksgiving‘s masked killer and makes it to a nearby warehouse. Once there, she discovers her town’s sheriff, Eric Newlon (Patrick Dempsey), lying unconscious near his patrol car and, shortly thereafter, watches through one of the nearby warehouse’s windows as her ex-boyfriend, Bobby (Jalen Thomas Brooks), takes off the same mask worn by her murderous pursuer. Assuming the worst, Jessica teams up with Sheriff Newlon to try to take Bobby, down only for the latter to escape. Newlon calls in backup and a manhunt for Bobby begins. However, just when it seems like Jessica has successfully saved the lives of her father and several of her remaining friends, she notices some of the same burrs stuck to Newlon’s boots that got stuck to her own legs as she ran away from the film’s masked slasher only an hour or so earlier. Unfortunately, it doesn’t take long for Newlon to notice the burrs on his boots and deduce that Jessica has realized that he is, in fact, the killer that has been targeting her and her friends for the past few days. Trapping Jessica in a secluded room with him, Newlon reveals that his secret lover, Amanda Collins (Gina Gershon), was one of the victims of the previous year’s Black Friday massacre. The incident was the direct result of not only gross negligence on the part of Jessica’s rich father, Thomas (Rick Hoffman), but also the immature behavior of her and her friends. In case that wasn’t bad enough, Newlon further reveals that Amanda was pregnant with his baby when she was killed. Jessica, for her part, realizes that Newlon had been using his position as the town’s sheriff to get as much information from her as he could about everyone responsible for Amanda’s death. After Jessica escaped his gruesome Thanksgiving ceremony, Newlon planned on framing Bobby, whom he’d previously kidnapped and drugged, for all of his crimes. When he’s just on the verge of killing her and finishing his plan, however, Jessica reveals that she’s been secretly live-streaming his confession. Enraged, Newlon charges at Jessica only to be hit by a hammer thrown through the room’s window by Bobby, who rushes in and saves his ex-girlfriend. As the two teenagers attempt to get out of the warehouse alive, they’re stalked by an ax-wielding Newlon, who comes dangerously close several times to cutting both of their lives short. Jessica, thankfully, manages to use the flammable gas in a nearby inflatable turkey and the gunpowder of an antique, pilgrim-era musket to blindside Newlon with a devastating explosion. Hours later, Jessica is reunited with her surviving friends and family members, and it seems like everything has ended as well as possible forThanksgiving’s remaining would-be victims. That is, at least, until the film serves up one final, tried-and-true horror movie twist. As Jessica and Bobby sit in an ambulance outside the warehouse where they faced off with Newlon, she overhears a couple of firefighters note that they didn’t find a single body within the building’s charred remains. Roth emphasizes this reveal with a shot of a masked firefighter walking away from the warehouse — seemingly implying that Dempsey’s Sheriff Newlon will be back to unleash more violence in the future. Later that night, Jessica wakes up from a nightmare in which she’s attacked by Newlon’s burning body. The purposefully open-ended moment suggests that she, likeThanksgiving’s presumably still-alive villain, won’t be relaxing or resting anytime soon. The film, in other words, not only sets the stage for it to be the first installment of a new horror franchise, but it also leaves plenty on the table for a potential sequel. Of course, whether or notThanksgiving’s story will ever actually be continued remains to be seen. Thanksgivingis now playing in theaters."

This generatesUS$1.5 trillion annually. But wildfire threatens industries such as timber milling and paper manufacturing, and the threat is far greater than most people realize.Our research, published today in the journalNature Geoscience, shows that between 2001 and 2021, severe wildfires worldwide destroyed timber-producing forests equivalent to an area the size of Great Britain. Severe fires reach the tree tops and consume theforest canopy.The amount of timber-producingforestburning each year in severe wildfires has increased significantly in the past decade. The western United States, Canada, Siberia, Brazil and Australia have been most affected.Timber demand is expected to almost triple by 2050. Supplying demand is clearly going to be challenging. Our research highlights the need to urgently adopt new management strategies and emerging technologies to combat the increasing threat of wildfires.What we foundWe combined global maps of logging activity and severe wildfires to determine how much timber-producing forest was lost to wildfire this century. Between 2001 and 2021, up to 25 million hectares of timber-producing forest was severely burned. The extent of fire has jumped markedly in the past decade, from an average of less than one million hectares a year up to 2015 to triple that since then.At a national scale, the three countries with the largest absolute wildfire-induced losses of timber-producing forest were Russia, the US and Canada. When it comes to proportion of their forestry land lost, the nations with the highest percentages burnt were Portugal, followed by Australia.Why are more forests burning?Climate change is amajor driver of fire weather and fire behavior. The increased risk of high-severity wildfire is an entirely expected outcome of warmer temperatures and, in some places, reduced rainfall.However, it remains unclear why so much wood-production forest is being lost, and why the increase in burnt area has been so marked in the past decade.One possible reason islogging makes forests more flammable. This has been documented in parts of southeastern Australia, where intact forest alwaysburnt at lower severity than harvested forestacross the entire footprint of the Black Summer fires. Forests that have been subject to thinning also areat risk of high-severity wildfire.What does this mean for us?Whatever the reason, it is clear these fires in wood-production forests will have profound impacts on global timber supplies and all the industries associated with them. This is a huge problem for society and the environment, because timber demand is expected to triple by 2050, in part to facilitate the transition away from carbon-intensive cement in construction.In many parts of the world, it typically takes 80–100 years or even longer to grow a tree to a size at which it can be a sawlog for products like furniture and floorboards. So the increased frequency of high-severity wildfire means fewer areas of forestwill escape fire for long enoughto reach timber harvesting age.This is especially problematic where logging makes forests more prone to burning in a high-severity wildfire.Furthermore, given the long-term nature of timber production, typically on cutting cycles ranging from 40 years to more than a century, future timber crops will face a very different climate as they mature.Responding to the challengeIf wood production from forests becomes increasing costly and timber is increasingly hard to source, there may be more pressure from industry and government to log other places, such as tropical forests, with high biodiversity and conservation value.One way to tackle the problem is to grow more timber in plantations. Plantations already producea third of the main forms of wood-producing timber—called industrial roundwood. They do this from just 3% of the area of natural forests.Well managed plantations can grow a successful timber crop within a couple of decades. This is a lot shorter than the many decades and sometimes even centuries required to grow sawlogs in native forests. Having ashorter growing time in plantationsincreases the chances of harvesting trees before they are destroyed in awildfire.But plantations, like some logged and regenerated native forests, can be highly flammable. Fire risks need to be carefully managed. That includes planning, to avoid putting neighboring areas and human communities atgreater risk of being burnt.Another key strategy to better protecttimberresources will be to adopt new technologies to more quicklydetect and then rapidly suppress ignitionssuch as those originating from lightning strikes.Big fires start as small fires. Thebest time to suppress fires is when they are small, and as soon as ignition occurs. We have been involved in the development of drone fleets and unmanned aerial water andfiresuppressant dispensing craft to more quicklydetect and extinguish wildfires.New technologies, as well as more, better planned and managed plantations will be crucial in not only protecting forests, but alsosafeguarding the flow of marketable timberand the industries dependent upon them."

Massive Wild Fire forcing thousands of people to evacuate their homes, wildfires spreading rapidly, ... [+] escaping to save their lives, destroyed silhouette, natural calamity As our planet continues to warm, increased fires across the globe have created havoc globally with increased frequency and severity. Preventing wildfires and predicting their risks, before they are out of control is a priority for governments globally as the 2024 weather outlook is predicting another devastating heat scorching year ahead. Fighting wildfires is not only complex; it is dangerous and takes lives. Global Forest Watch tracks tree losses and their latest data on forest fires that compared to twenty years ago, determined that we are today burning twice as much tree cover. In addition, a recent study by the University of Maryland, calculated that forest fires result in three million more hectares of tree cover loss per year compared to 2001, an area roughly the size of Belgium, and accounted for more than one-quarter of all tree cover loss over the past twenty years. In 2023, we saw heightened fire activity, including record-breaking burns across Canada and catastrophic fires in Hawaii. The increasing levels of fire are accelerating due to climate change and the extreme heat waves which are already five times more likely today than one hundred years ago. One of the largest fires in the United States in 2022 was the California Mosquito Fire, which burned thousands of hectares of forest in and near areas classified as wildland- urban interfaces, destroying seventy-eight structures in nearby communities. This was just one of the many fires that made 2022, a record year in the U.S., with almost one million hectares of tree cover burned across the country, resulting in roughly $3.2 billion in damages. Furthermore, summer heat waves were a dominant force in driving fire activity across the Mediterranean basin. In 2022, record-breaking heat and drought in Spain resulted in more than 70,000 hectares of tree cover burned, the largest amount since 2001. Five years earlier, more than 130,000 hectares of tree cover burned in Portugal under similar circumstances, a greater loss than the previous ten years combined. Where I live in Canada, we experienced record levels of fires burning coast to coast. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported that an estimated 18.5 million hectares have burned in 2023, surpassing the previous high of 17.5 million hectares dating back to 1983. Finding new ways to forecasting wildfire risks is not new, however the methods using AI is relatively new, as an alternative method to combat changes brought about by increasingly climatic changes. Firefighters and start-ups are using AI-enabled cameras to scan the horizon for signs of smoke. A German company is building a constellation of satellites to detect fires from space. And Microsoft is using AI models to predict where the next blaze could be sparked. Another initiative is The FireAId initiative, led by the World Economic Forum, is using artificial intelligence (AI) to give those fighting fires a better chance of acting at earlier stages, before the fire becomes “wild.” In other words studying wildfire trends, analyzing data to build better prediction tools. Data, AI, and simulation technology can help cut through the complexity and give firefighters more insights to help fight the effects of climate change. The FireAId vision is to provide an intuitive tool that is both user-friendly and useful, allowing firefighters to gain valuable time, focusing resources where they will be most effective. Canada which was hard hit coast to coast with major forest devastations in 2023 is also innovating where Alberta’s Province’s forest firefighting agency partnered with Edmonton headquartered, AltaML, which can now successfully forecast a new wildfire eighty percent of the time. Using machine learning, the AltaML fight prevention AI Model analyzes thousands of data points to forecast, based on region, how likely new fires will be the next day. Given that it’s trained through historical fire data, it can also make predictions through regional weather and forest conditions. It analyzed global carbon emissions , each day of the week to see if there are any correlations with wildfires, climate change and human behaviour. One of the areas of research underway is ""Being able to predict where the most likely chance of wildfires are on a daily basis, so that crews and equipment can be placed appropriately ... it's looking like it's going to save millions of dollars just this fire season, just by reallocating resources to the right places,"" Co-Founder, Nicole Janssen, CEO has said. It is already estimated that the AltaML model can help Alberta Wildfire save between $2 million and $5 million in yearly operating costs. Another firefighting innovation is AUDREY, the Assistant for Understanding Data through Reasoning, Extraction, and synthesis, which is a NASA-developed software application that “performs data fusion and provides tailored situational awareness to first fire responders.” AUDREY collects essential fire data — like temperatures, the presence of gases, how quickly a fire develops, how the items that are burning effect fire growth, how much time firefighters have to respond, and fire flow paths. It then uses that data to help guide first responders through the scenario in the safest and most effective way possible. In the future, the hope is that AUDREY can serve as a guide for first responders and “track an entire team of firefighters, sending relevant signals to individuals while helping to make recommendations for how they could work together.” Wildfires are accelerating globally as the planet warms with the increasing presence of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Every year with global warming, millions of tons of CO2 is dumped into the environment. Forests take generations to recover from wildfire devastation and their impacts deplete natural resources, and harm lives of firefighters and residents. As the world continues to heat up, governments are scrambling to get ahead of the flames by tapping into the latest AI technology. Will AI give us a leg up, there is no question in my mind that it will. AI /ML Innovations from AltaML, Microsoft, NASA, and The World Economic Forum represent some of the heroic leadership efforts that are being made to detect and help prevent wildfires."

In the first two weeks of November, fires fueled by unusually dry and hot weather destroyed nearly 770,000 hectares (1.9 million acres) of the world’s largest tropical wetlands, preliminary figures from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro show. This accounts for 65% of the damage done by fires in the region this year. Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research, a federal agency, detected 3,380 fires in the Pantanal in the first 17 days of November, compared to just 69 in the same period a year ago, and well beyond previous fire season records dating back to 1998. The Pantanal holds thousands of plant and animal species, including 159 mammals, and it abounds with jaguars, according to the World Wildlife Fund. During the rainy season, rivers overflow their banks, flood the land and make most of it accessible only by boat and plane. In the dry season, wildlife enthusiasts flock to see the normally furtive jaguars lounging on riverbanks, along with macaws, caimans and capybaras. Much of the Encontro das Aguas (Meeting of the Waters) park, located at the border of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul states — known for its large jaguar population — had turned from emerald green to dark brown. A team of Associated Press journalists on the ground spotted a large jaguar licking its paws by the river banks, lying on a bed of burnt vegetation. “If this continues every year, there won't be anymore (jaguars), they’ll go away, they’ll find a way, like people and run to the city,"" said Leonisio da Silva, a 53-year-old resident of the park. ""It is going to end.” Jaguars in the park, which covers more than 1,000 square kilometers (over 400 square miles), are accustomed to human observation and have been a top ecotourism draw for more than 15 years. Their preservation and that of their natural habitat are essential in a region. Firefighters, troops and volunteers are working night and day to try and stop the fires, which are threatening not only the region’s rich fauna and flora but also houses and touristic guesthouses. And there is little outlook for any near-term help from rainfall. “This is so atypical,” said Renata Libonati, who coordinates the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's alert system for fires in the Pantanal. The fire season usually ends in October, when the air gets more humid and it begins to rain. “What we're seeing is an extension of the fire season.” Libonati said the heat wave that swept through much of Brazil this week, combined with the El Niño phenomenon led to higher temperatures and drier weather conditions, both favorable to fires. Firefighters and authorities in the Pantanal region are also faced with a logistical nightmare. Angelo Rabelo, president of a localenvironmental group that oversees a protected area of about 300,000 hectares (1,160 square miles), runs his own fire brigade, currently comprised of eight members, working alongside a small team of national forest firefighters. “Access to some areas, especially the fire heads, necessarily implies ... the arrival of helicopters,” he said. The state of Mato Grosso do Sul launched on Nov. 14 a joint task force, mobilizing the state’s entire fleet of aircraft to help firefighters, either dropping water on fires or flying out firefighters to the region’s most remote locations. It also declared a state of emergency in four municipalities most affected by forest fires and where parks and protected areas were particularly at risk. The neighboring state of Mato Grosso said it had also strengthened its workforce, with about 200 federal and state firefighters on the ground. The state’s Secretary of Environment said it will invest an additional 6.4 million reais (1.3 million dollars) in the region. Intense fires were reported around the main accessways to the biome, or area classified according to the species that live in that location. Videos shared on social media showed a car driving down the BR-262 highway, with flames on each side, as if passing through a corridor of fire. Thick smoke emanating from the fires reduced visibility this week, with the Federal Highway Police closing the BR-262 at one point, and reports of a small private plane crashing, injuring four. Lack of visibility also hindered rescue efforts, firefighters said. Some on the ground were also growing frustrated with authorities' seemingly slow response. Enderson Barreto, a 25-year-old veterinarian in Porto Jofre, a small municipality close to the Meeting of the Waters park, said his and other colleagues' pleas for help weeks ago were left unanswered, until it was too late. “We alerted several times in relation to the fires,” Barreto said, adding that people told them they were being too alarmist. “Greater energy should have been put out when the fires were not in such large proportions. Today it is totally out of control."" When he is not rescuing animals from the fires, Barreto is helping firefighters combat the flames. He said the impacts were “unmeasurable.” Fires are frequent in the Pantanal and vegetation can regenerate quickly with rain. But when the fires are too intense, or attack more densely forested areas, the wildlife that survive are left stranded without habitat. This year’s fires, for now, are not as dramatic as those of 2020, when flames engulfed more than 3.5 million hectares of wetlands, or about 30% of the Pantanal, killing and injuring countless animals, including jaguars. From where he was standing, Barreto said, small reptiles and amphibians seem to be the main victims in this year's tragedy. “They are invisible victims, but they are the base of the chain, for the balance of this ecosystem,” the young veterinarian said. ___ Jeantet contributed from Rio de Janeiro. ___ Follow AP’s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment"

 / Another wide-ranging set of announcements from the tec… [+10447 chars]",Netherlands,"People shopping for electric vehicles, heat pumps, or air conditioning units will see enhanced search results on Google in a series of updates the company hopes will help people live more sustainable, climate-friendly lives. The tech giant revealed the new updates alongside a host of expanded AI tools for people and policymakers to reduce tailpipe emissions and better predict floods, wildfires, and extreme heat. As the effects of climate change intensify, Google has taken to routinely rolling out packages of updates aimed at helping individuals and organizations reduce their carbon footprint. Taken together, today’s announcements represent a renewed effort by the company to help the world mitigate the impact of climate change and better prepare for a future dominated by climate upheaval, said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. “Fighting climate change is humanity’s next big moonshot” “Fighting climate change is humanity’s next big moonshot,” Pichai said in a video message shared with reporters. “And as with any moonshot, we’re going to have to answer some big questions to get there.” There’s a lot that’s being announced today, so here’s the rundown: EV search results Electric vehicle sales are growing by leaps and bounds as more models hit dealerships. And EV newbies are increasingly looking for trusted information to help them decide whether they’re ready to make the switch. Into the fray steps Google, which wants to be a one-stop shop for anyone looking to electrify their life. The company is rolling out new search results for EV shoppers by including information about possible government incentives, like the federal EV tax credit in the US. That way, people can see whether the vehicle they have their eyes on qualifies for any discounts. The improved search results are already live in the US and will be hitting France and Germany later this year. EV owners will also get more details about battery range when searching for specific models on Google. In particular, they’ll see information about how they can drive on a single charge and will be able to customize routes based on elevation changes and speed limits so they can determine how many charging stops they’ll need along the way. The battery range explorer is launching in the US and will be available in Europe early next year. Estimating accurate battery range in an EV is a bit of a moving target, subject to a lot of external factors such as temperature. Google is pulling information about the car, such as the mass and battery size, from the Knowledge Graph , Google’s database of billions of facts about people, places, and things. The company is also sourcing road load data from the EPA, which captures factors such as rolling friction, aerodynamics, and mechanical friction. Google is also rolling out an updated fuel cost calculator for electric and gas car search results, giving people the ability to compare their per-mile costs. This will allow people to calculate potential savings when switching from gas to electric powertrains. This feature is now available in 21 countries around the world. Lastly, fuel-efficient routing, which uses AI to suggest routes with fewer hills, less traffic, and constant speeds with the same or similar ETA, is being expanded to India and Indonesia — two populous nations with major pollution problems. Cycling and transit For people who want to use non-car modes of transportation, Google is collaborating with local governments to update its cycling routes in Google Maps. For example, by working with Transport for London, Google is adding hundreds of kilometers of new bike lanes to its navigation tools. This builds on a long-term project at Google to provide an easier way to get better multimodal directions for people who want to use multiple sustainable modes of transportation, like cycling, transit, and walking. Meanwhile, in France, Google is piloting a new feature that suggests public transit and walking routes alongside your driving route “if they’re practical and comparable in time,” said Yael Maguire, vice president of geo sustainability. Aviation Google’s sustainable aviation project is getting bigger. Earlier this year, the company announced that it was partnering with American Airlines and Bill Gates’ climate investment fund, Breakthrough Energy, to chart more sustainable flight routes . The aim was to help pilots limit a flight’s impact on the climate by avoiding routes that create contrails, those white streaks in the sky that planes sometimes leave behind. Now, the contrail effort is growing to include the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, or Eurocontrol. This group manages aviation for a number of nations, including Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, as well as northwest Germany. Eurocontrol will now use Google’s tools to advise pilots flying through the region how to better avoid creating contrails and reduce emissions. Project Green Light In 2021, Google announced a new effort to reduce carbon emissions in cities called Project Green Light, an AI-driven effort to make traffic lights more efficient, thereby decreasing pollution. Typically, stop-and-go traffic results in more carbon emissions, which has the effect of polluting the air in dense cities and worsening health conditions for residents. Intersections, in particular, are found to be especially dirty, with pollution rates up to 29 times higher than on open roads . Half the emissions at traffic intersections can be linked to vehicles stopping and starting, according to Google’s analysis of driving trends leveraging Department of Energy models. Project Green Light uses AI to help traffic engineers tweak traffic lights so cars and trucks travel more smoothly, with less stopping and starting. Google claims the tools are extraordinarily easy to implement, activating in just five minutes using existing traffic management infrastructure. Google says that early numbers from test cities indicate that Project Green Light can reduce stops by as much as 30 percent. Today, Google announced it was expanding Project Green Light to over a dozen cities, including Rio de Janeiro, Manchester, Jakarta, and Budapest — with more cities planned for later this year. Home improvements Google will show more details about sustainable energy devices for people searching for appliances like heat pumps and air conditioning units. When people search about home heating and cooling systems like “boilers” or “air conditioning,” they’ll see information about other sustainable options, including their capabilities, their energy efficiency, and important financial government incentives. Searching for “furnace,” for example, will show information about types of heating systems, how they compare to energy-saving options such as heat pumps, and potential savings through tax credits and incentives for each. The search results use data provided by the Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy Star, energy.gov in the US, and the International Energy Agency in the EU. Solar panels and ‘cool roofs’ Sustainable choices aren’t just for individuals. To help cities better include solar energy in their development plans, Google is updating Google Earth to make it easier for planners to determine the best building designs and solar options for urban areas. This new tool aims to provide urban planners with an understanding of the solar reflectivity of different surface areas, combined with insights to enable cities to better identify which neighborhoods would benefit most from investments, and allocate resources accordingly. Google sees this as being particularly useful when planning to build places with large roofs, like parking garages. Google’s “cool roofs” tool, which uses AI and aerial imagery to map out the solar reflectivity of cities so urban planners and governments can identify which areas would benefit most from deploying a cool roof solution, such as a white roof, is also growing to include more cities in the coming weeks. Flood, heat, and wildfire warnings As the world warms, more and more populations are finding themselves at risk of natural disasters, whether it’s flooding, extreme heat, or wildfires. Google sees its role as helping mitigate the impact of these disasters by providing information to decision-makers so they can be prepared ahead of time. Or, as The Verge ’s Justine Calma wrote last year: Half of the world lacks adequate early warning systems for disasters like floods and fires, a United Nations report found last month. That’s a lack of lifesaving technology that can give people enough lead time to get themselves to safety. The hope is that Google’s services can fill in some gaps, especially as climate change makes floods and fires even more dangerous than they were in the past. Today, the company is expanding its Flood Hub tool to the US and Canada, adding those nations to a list that includes around 80 other countries that use the feature. The hub will cover 800 riverside locations where some 12 million people currently live. In 2020 , Google also started offering users in the US a map feature that shows wildfire boundaries in near real time. The company says it’s working with the US Forest Service to update its fire spread model, which would be “the biggest update in 50 years.” Google says it’s using machine learning to “model more fire dynamics to help fire authorities train firefighters, plan effective fuel treatments and battle large-scale fires more safely and effectively while in the field.” Lastly, Google is expanding its “tree canopy” tool, which uses AI to help cities keep their residents cool by mapping out where trees are needed most, to 2,000 additional cities globally. The costs of AI Asked about the climate impact of AI, Google said it was challenging to predict the future growth of data centers, for example, as AI use cases expand and evolve. “If we look historically at research and also our own experience, it’s that AI compute demand has gone up much more slowly than the power needed for it,” Kate Brandt, chief sustainability officer at the company, told reporters. Brandt added that using new versions of TPUs, or tensor processing units, has proved to be faster and more efficient than previous versions. And data centers are being redesigned to be more energy-efficient and sustainable altogether. “We’re about 1.5 times as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center,” she said. “And of course, we’re driving towards carbon free energy in our data center operation.” Comments"

The charity says climate change is ""the single biggest… [+6504 chars]",Climate,"Flooding, wildfires and extreme weather threaten the future of nearly three-quarters of sites managed by the National Trust, a new report says. The charity says climate change is ""the single biggest threat"" facing its 28,500 historic homes, 250,000 hectares of land and 780 miles of coastline. In Monday's report, the trust called on the UK government to do more to help organisations adapt to climate change. The government said it had a five-year plan to boost the country's resilience. Patrick Begg, the trust's natural resources director, said that climate change demanded ""urgent and unswerving attention"" and presented ""the single biggest threat to the places in our care"". The trust is monitoring the climate change threats posed to its stately homes, museum collections, parks, gardens and land holdings by mapping current extreme weather events, such as downpours, flooding, drought and wildfires. It then uses the data on its 'hazard map' to predict the threats posed to its sites under a ""worst-case scenario"" in which greenhouse gas emissions, which trap heat in the atmosphere, continue at their current rate. The charity says planning for the worst will help it identify vulnerable sites across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and use knowledge gained on the ground by local teams to adapt to the impacts of climate change. When the map was launched in 2021, it estimated that the number of National Trust sites facing a high level of threat from issues such as coastal erosion, extreme heat and flooding could rise from 5% to 17% over the next 40 years. But in Monday's report - ""A Climate for Change"" - the trust now estimates that 71% of its sites could be at medium or high risk of being impacted by climate change-related extreme weather events by 2060. In response, the conservation body is ramping up its work on climate adaptation, spending millions to repair and protect some sites but also having to decide where money could be better spent. One of those sites where the trust is looking at new ways of working is Mullion Cove Harbour in Cornwall. Nestled between steep cliffs and built in the 1890s, the harbour's two breakwaters are being hit by frequent and violent storms. That has left the trust needing to spend more than £2m on repairing them - with more than 80% of that spent since 1995. It's a cost that might not be worth continuing to pay in the face of rising sea levels and the trust may decide not to carry on with major repairs to one of the two breakwaters. Catherine Lee, community manager for the National Trust on the Lizard Peninsula, told the BBC: ""We've reached the threshold where we feel very strongly that it's unviable to repair the southern breakwater like-for-like. ""That's a really tough call - the National Trust is about looking after special places forever. But what we know is that we can't continue this battle against climate change. We have to adapt to climate change."" The trust is focusing its efforts on the western breakwater, working closely with local volunteers on day-to-day repairs. One of those volunteers is third-generation fisherman Jonny Pascoe, who is also chairman of the Mullion Cove Harbour Society. ""My dad and grandfather worked here so it's a very special place to me. I like to think I'm keeping that heritage going and being part of that rich history,"" he said. Mr Pascoe said ""hard discussions"" had to be had with the trust about what could be saved, and how. ""We can't afford to procrastinate. The climate change situation is not going to allow us to. The sea is certainly not going to allow us to,"" he explained. When it comes to the trust's historic buildings and stately homes, protecting them from extreme weather isn't cheap. The Tudor mansion Coughton Court in Warwickshire is currently undergoing a £3.3m facelift to make sure its roof and gutters can cope with heavy rainfall. Already, staff at the country house have had to rescue collections of historic paintings and chandeliers, which had been leaked on. In other locations, extreme weather has already seen the trust accept climate adaptation will sometimes mean letting things go. At the Iron Age hill fort Dinas Dinlle on Wales' Gwynedd coast, erosion made worse by heavy rainfall in recent years is destroying the site, with many parts already lost to the sea. But its story and history is being recorded - digital 3D modelling is being used to keep a record of the site before it disappears. The work is being carried out with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales and Aberystwyth University. Three years of work at the site has shown that increasingly heavy rainfall is having a significant impact on the ongoing erosion of the hill fort. Professor Sarah Davies, from Aberystwyth University, said the 3D modelling and geophysical studies of the area would help them ""understand more about the hills, the landscape around it and the rates of change before that information is lost"". The National Trust is now calling for more funding and support from government for landowners, heritage organisations and tourism groups across England, Wales and Northern Ireland to help them adapt their buildings, coastlines and countryside to better cope with the impacts of climate change It also wants to see the UK government establish a new Climate Resilience Bill to create national targets for adaptation and a statutory duty on all public bodies to make adaptation a key factor in decision-making. The UK government said it had a national adaptation programme that does set out a five-year plan to increase the country's resilience to climate change risks, including those posed to heritage sites and its coastline and countryside. It added that it had committed to investing billions of pounds in wider climate change adaptation measures, including £5.2bn on flood and coastal schemes in England. A Welsh government spokesperson said it took climate adaptation ""extremely seriously"" and would be publishing a new national strategy towards the end of next year. A spokesperson for Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) said it welcomed the trust's report and said it would also be publishing a new climate change adaptation programme in late 2024."

Known for its lush landscapes and vibrant wildlife, including jaguars, caimans, macaws and monkeys, the Pantanal is home to the world’s biggest tropical wetlands and, in normal times, a thriving eco-tourism industry. But in recent weeks, it has been ravaged by fires that are threatening its iconic wildlife as Brazil suffers through a Southern Hemisphere spring of droughts and record heat. There were 2,387 fires in the Pantanal in the first 13 days of November, an increase of more than 1,000 percent from the entire month of November last year, according to satellite monitoring by Brazilian space research agency INPE. “The situation is completely out of control. And between the heatwave and the wind, it’s only going to get worse,” says biologist Gustavo Figueiroa, 31, head of the environmental group SOS Pantanal. “The Pantanal is a region that’s used to fires. Normally, it regenerates naturally. But this many fires isn’t normal.” It has been hit hard by drought this year, with normally flooded areas reduced to shrivelled ponds. At one such spot along the dirt highway across the region, the 150km (93-mile) Transpantaneira, a small group of caimans can be seen trying to swim in the shallow water. Nearby, the corpse of another sits rotting on the bank. Elsewhere, a dead porcupine lays on a carpet of ash in the charred remains of what was once a forest. “It probably died of smoke inhalation,” says veterinarian Aracelli Hammann, who is volunteering with a wildlife rescue group. They made the grim find in the Encontro das Aguas park, home to the world’s largest jaguar population.

Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here. Moving is never easy — and it’s even harder in the era of global warming. Beyond the usual concerns like jobs, affordability, and proximity to family and friends, people are now considering rising seas, wildfire smoke, and heat waves. According to a recent survey, nearly a third of Americans named climate change as a motivation to move. Some are headed to “climate havens,” the places experts say will be relatively pleasant to live in as the world heats up, like Duluth, Minnesota; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and Burlington, Vermont. Researchers have pointed to the Great Lakes region, and Michigan in particular, as a destination for people seeking to escape the storm-ravaged Southeast or the parched Southwest. The Midwest holds special appeal with its abundant fresh water, cooler summers, and comparatively little risk from hurricanes and wildfires. But as the federal government’s comprehensive Fifth National Climate Assessment detailed last week, there’s nowhere you can truly hide from climate change. This summer, historic wildfires in Canada sent unhealthy smoke swirling into the Midwest and Northeast, bringing apocalyptic skies from Minneapolis to Buffalo, New York, and all the supposed refuges in between. Heavy rain in July caused devastating flash floods in Vermont. Three years earlier, a ProPublica analysis had identified the hardest-hit place in the state, Lamoille County, as the safest county in the U.S. “It’s time to put the idea of climate safe havens to rest,” the climate news site Heatmap declared this summer. Still, the new assessment demonstrates that some places are safer than others. The report says that moving away from more dangerous spots to less precarious ones is a solution that’s already happening — not only in coastal areas in the Southeast, but also in flood zones in the Midwest. The assessment also makes it clear that vulnerability is often created by city planning choices. Climate havens may not be something nature hands us, but something we have to build ourselves. And finding refuge doesn’t necessarily entail moving across the country; given the right preparations, it could be closer to home than you think. “While the climate is going to change, how we respond as a species, as a society, as individuals, I think will really determine what is a ‘refuge’ for us and what isn’t,” said Vivek Shandas, a professor at Portland State University whose research focuses on how cities can adapt to climate change. Shandas, who worked on the Northwest chapter of the report, says that it points to how human choices — policies and urban design decisions — have either put people more in harm’s way or brought them greater safety. Tulsa, Oklahoma, was once the country’s most frequently flooded city, according to the assessment. After a disaster in 1984 submerged 7,000 homes and killed 14 people, the city came together to fix the problem with an aggressive flood-control plan. They constructed a network of drainage systems, created green spaces to soak up water, and put strict rules on where new homes could be built. Over the last three decades, Tulsa has also cleared roughly 1,000 buildings out of flood zones through a buyout program. Officials say the effort has saved the city millions of dollars, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency gave Tulsa its top risk-reduction rating last year. That’s the kind of tough work that lies ahead of any Midwest city aiming to protect its residents. With dam failures and overflows from combined sewer and stormwater systems common, the region is unprepared to handle the volume of water now coursing in. “Just being more sheltered from certain dangers does not make you a haven,” said Julie Arbit, who researches equity and the environment at the University of Michigan. And flooding isn’t the only problem. Purported climate havens like Minneapolis, Duluth, Ann Arbor, and Madison, Wisconsin, will see some of the greatest temperature increases in the country in the coming decades. Residents of Michigan and Wisconsin face some of the longest power outages in the country. The idea that any city could be a climate haven traces back to Jesse Keenan, a professor of urban planning at Tulane University — though he suspects the phrase itself was invented by journalists. “People often associate me with coining that concept, but I don’t think I’ve ever used that phrase in any of my talks or writing,” Keenan said (though he did come up with “climate-proof Duluth.”) In 2018, the journalist Oliver Milman wrote an article for The Guardian looking at the parts of the U.S. that might be less miserable as the climate changes, calling Duluth and Buffalo “safe havens.” That framing took off the following year, making the headlines in Reuters, Yale Climate Connections, and Bloomberg. Keenan said he probably wouldn’t have used the phrase “climate havens,” though he does take credit for the proposition behind it. “The general idea is that there are places that people are going to move to, whether we like it or not, whether we plan for it or not,” he said. “We need to help those places and guide those places to prepare.” The idea of climate havens caught on, in part, because it was a hopeful message for post-industrial cities in the Great Lakes region, raising the prospect of filling vacant homes and revitalizing sluggish economies. Over the last two decades, more than 400,000 people left the Midwest for other regions of the United States. In 2019, Buffalo’s mayor called his city a “climate refuge.” The title is still embraced by some city planners: The 2023 Green Cincinnati Plan names the city a “climate haven.” The reality of climate change has weakened the phrase’s charm. Another factor that could be dampening enthusiasm for havens, according to Shandas, is that researchers aren’t getting much federal funding for their proposals to identify the role climate change plays in propelling migration patterns. The National Climate Assessment, for instance, points out that there’s yet not enough data to “make a strong statement” on how climate change might drive migration to the Midwest. Beth Gibbons, an author of the Midwest chapter of the report and the national resilience lead with the consulting group Farallon Strategies, says she’s heard many anecdotes of people moving to the Great Lakes in search of a less hostile climate. Most locals, however, don’t share politicians’ enthusiasm for a wave of climate migration to the Midwest. Interviews across Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Western New York have found that people are nervous about the prospect, Gibbons said. “By and large, the sense in communities is that we have a lot of challenges as it is,” Gibbons said, “and they’re not sure that this sounds like something that is really an opportunity, but rather something else that they may have to be dealing with.” Environmental justice advocates also worry that “the idea of being a climate haven is going to become a distraction from caring for people who are already here.” The “climate havens” conversation has largely revolved around the Midwest, but new research suggests that other parts of the country might be getting overlooked. The Climate Vulnerability Index, released by the Environmental Defense Fund and Texas A&M University last month, maps out risk across the United States on a neighborhood level, measuring environmental dangers alongside factors that make it harder for people to deal with hazards, such as income levels and access to health care. According to data provided to Grist, the least vulnerable counties are mostly rural and scattered across the northern part of the country, from Nantucket County, Massachusetts, to Juneau County, Alaska. The only Midwest spot to make the top 10 was Oneida County in Wisconsin. And the only place with a large population (numbering 600,000 people) on the list was Washington County, Oregon, which includes the east side of Portland. Portland has been named as a potential climate haven before, but the idea has recently fallen out of favor after the Pacific Northwest was struck by an off-the-charts heat dome in June 2021. It brought 116-degree temperatures to Portland, melting streetcar power cables and buckling pavement. In a region largely unaccustomed to owning air-conditioning units, roughly 1,000 people died across Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. “‘Nowhere is safe’: Heat shatters vision of Pacific Northwest as climate refuge,” read a headline in The Guardian at the time. Two years later, Portland and Seattle are more prepared for heat. “The Northwest went bananas with distributing heat pumps and AC units all over the place,” Shandas said. One bad disaster doesn’t necessarily cross a given place off the “havens” list; people can learn from past events and work to better survive the next disaster. And the reality is that most people are unlikely to pack up their belongings and move across the country to find refuge. There’s “no doubt that most people will be moving relatively locally,” Keenan said. He says that climate migration, even at a more local level, presents another opportunity to get it right when it comes to urban development. “We can either recreate crap suburban sprawl and high-carbon sprawl, or we can try to do it the right way. But we will branch into new cities in America, and those may be closer to home than we realize.” “Local refuges” might provide a better framework for discussing how to escape the worst of climate change, Shandas said. He borrowed the concept from the field of ecology, where the Latin “refugia” refers to areas where the climate conditions stay relatively safe over time, despite change happening around them. A local refuge could be a community center with air conditioning during a heat wave. Or it could mean moving out of a wildfire danger zone, or up the hill to escape frequent flooding. “For me, that’s a wonderful thought,” Shandas said, “because it allows humans to actually not be the victim of, like, ‘Oh my God, no matter where we go, we’re going to be crushed by this climate.’ And it’s like, ‘No, actually, there are things we can do.” This article originally appeared in Grist at https://grist.org/migration/climate-havens-national-climate-assessment-midwest-migration/.

(“Bridger” or “Bridger Aerospace”), (NASDAQ: BAER, BAERW), one of the nation’s largest aerial firefighting companies, today announced that it has entered into a joint venture partnership to complete the purchase of four Canadair CL-215T Amphibious Aircraft recently awarded in a public tender process from the Government of Spain for €40.3 million. The purchase by the partnership, which brings together Marathon Asset Management LP, Avenue Sustainable Solutions Fund, and Bridger, is expected to formally close in ten business days. “Bridger’s mission is to support communities affected by wildfires wherever they occur. There is global demand for specialty aircraft like the CL-215T, and with the addition of these airframes we are positioned to operate the largest privately owned scooper fleet in the world. Our access to these aircraft represents a strategic and transformative step for Bridger and positions us to expand our customer base and create substantial revenue and cash flow growth for the next several years,” commented Tim Sheehy, Bridger’s Chief Executive Officer. The terms of the agreement entered into between Bridger and the partnership provide that Bridger will manage the return to service upgrades of the planes while they are owned and funded by the partnership. Bridger has the right, but not the obligation, to acquire each plane as it is ready to be contracted and returned to service. Bridger plans to acquire the aircraft in a sequential manner as they are modified and subsequently contracted for service. Bridger expects the first two Scoopers to be ready for contract operations in the Summer of 2024 in the European Union. The return to service work on the third and fourth Scoopers is expected to commence once Bridger acquires the first two modified and contracted Scoopers from the partnership. McAndrew Rudisill, Bridger’s Chief Investment Officer, commented, “We are excited to partner with Marathon and Avenue to co-invest in the transformative Spanish Scooper acquisition and appreciate their exhaustive efforts to close this transaction. This private capital solution eliminates the immediate need for any large near-term equity financing and helps strategically position Bridger to further diversify internationally, create exposure to the European fire season, and creates a multi-year growth trajectory for the company.” About Bridger AerospaceBased in Belgrade, Montana, Bridger Aerospace Group Holdings, Inc. is one of the nation’s largest aerial firefighting companies.

But i… [+3899 chars],New Zealand,"Therecovery of the ozone layer— which sits miles above the Earth and protects the planet from ultraviolet radiation — has been celebrated as one of the world’s greatest environmental achievements. But ina new study published Tuesday, some scientists claim it may not be recovering at all, and that the hole may even be expanding. The findings are in disagreement with widely accepted assessments of the ozone layer’s status, including a recent UN-backed study that showed it would return to 1980s levels as soon as 2040. In 1987, several countries agreed to ban or phase down the use of more than 100 ozone-depleting chemicals that had caused a “hole” in the layer above Antarctica. The depletion is mainly attributed to the use of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which were common in aerosol sprays, solvents and refrigerants. That ban, agreed under the Montreal Protocol, is widely considered to have been effective in aiding the ozone layer’s recovery. But the hole, which grows over the Antarctic during spring before shrinking again in the summer, reached record sizes in 2020 to 2022, prompting scientists in New Zealand to investigate why. Scientists sound the alarm as the world briefly smashes through 2-degree warming limit for the first time In a paper, published by Nature Communications, they found that ozone levels have reduced by 26% since 2004 at the core of the hole in the Antarctic springtime. “This means that the hole has not only remained large in area, but it has also become deeper [i.e. has less ozone] throughout most of Antarctic spring,” said Hannah Kessenich, a PhD Student at the University of Otago and lead author of the study. “The especially long-lived ozone holes during 2020-2022 fit squarely into this picture, as the size/depth of the hole during October was particularly notable in all three years.” To reach that conclusion, the scientists analyzed the ozone layer’s behavior from September to November using a satellite instrument. They used historical data to compare that behavior and changing ozone levels, and to measure signs of ozone recovery. They then sought to identify what was driving these changes. They found that the depletion of ozone and deepening of the hole were a result of changes in the Antarctic polar vortex, a vast swirl of low pressure and very cold air, high above the South Pole. The study’s authors didn’t go further to explore what was causing those changes, but they acknowledged that many factors could also contribute to ozone depletion, including planet-warming pollution; tiny, airborne particles that are emitted from wildfires and volcanoes; and changes in the solar cycle. No place in the US is safe from the climate crisis, but a new report shows where it’s most severe “Altogether, our findings reveal the recent, large ozone holes may not be caused just by CFCs,” Kessenich said. “So, while the Montreal Protocol has been indisputably successful in reducing CFCs over time and preventing environmental catastrophe, the recent persistent Antarctic ozone holes appear to be closely tied to changes in atmospheric dynamics.” Some scientists are skeptical of the study’s findings, which rely heavily on the holes observed in 2020 to 2022 and use a short period — 19 years — to make conclusions about the long-term health of the ozone layer. “Existing literature has already found reasons for these large ozone holes: Smoke from the 2019 bushfires and a volcanic eruption (La Soufriere), as well as a general relationship between the polar stratosphere and El Niño Southern Oscillation,” Martin Jucker, a scientist at the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales in Australia, told the Science Media Center. “We know that during La Niña years, the polar vortex in the stratosphere tends to be stronger and colder than usual, which means that ozone concentrations will also be lower during those years. The years 2020-22 have seen a rare triple La Niña, but this relationship is never mentioned in the study.” He noted the study’s authors said they removed two years in the record — 2002 and 2019 — to ensure that “exceptional events” did not skew their findings. “Those events have been shown to have strongly decreased the ozone hole size,” he said, “so including those events would probably have nullified any long-term negative trend.”"

Chris Buchleitner was 9 years old. The mirror had snapped off the side of his mother’s van a few minutes earlier, when she drove off the road and they went tumbling down a steep hill. Now his mother lay trapped in the crumpled van, down in the canyon. Chris had escaped from the van and climbed up to look for help. They were a few miles from the Mexican border. Chris had recently seen a Border Patrol helicopter, and he hoped to use the mirror as a signaling device. But the helicopter was nowhere in sight. His mother’s cell phone was out of range. Chris was lonely, afraid, running out of ideas. And then, in the gathering dusk, he saw a stranger approaching. The man had come from Mexico. He’d crossed the border illegally, planning to start a new life. He’d been separated from his companions as they dodged authorities and the criminals who prey on migrants in the desert. But he was still free, and if he caught a few more breaks he could make it to Tucson or Phoenix and find the kind of job he needed to support his family back home. Now this man had a choice to make. He could keep going, safe for now from the Border Patrol, and leave the boy on his own. Or he could stay, help the boy, and risk getting caught by the same people he’d been evading for the last three days. Manuel Cordova’s decision would have profound consequences for them both. Later, when the story got out, it would be invoked in the highly charged national debate about the costs and benefits of illegal immigration. That conversation would intensify in the years that followed. But as night fell on Forest Service Road 39, political arguments did not matter. There was only a boy who needed protection, a woman who needed rescuing, and a man who appeared to be their only hope. To this day, Chris doesn’t know why it happened. Maybe the sun got in her eyes, or part of the road gave way. Whatever the reason, his mother lost control of the van. She screamed. The van lurched and tipped. Everything seemed to move in slow motion. And as the van rolled and crashed down the hill, Chris pressed himself against the back seat and held on for dear life. Chris loved camping, but he’d always had a bad feeling about this trip. He wasn’t sure why.Chris and his mother and father had once traveled the American West with their pop-up camper, exploring those glorious open spaces, but a trip like that would never happen again. Chris’s father had died that September. Now Chris and his mother, a biology teacher named Dawn Tomko, were persevering on their own. Chris told his mom he didn’t want to go camping. But Dawn, a former park ranger, couldn’t wait to get back out into nature. At home in Rimrock, Arizona, she planned another trip for Thanksgiving week. They brought their dogs, Tanner and Jade. They were on the way back to their campsite from a mountain-biking excursion when the van careened off the road. Down in the canyon, the van rested against a tree, the engine still running. From the back seat, Chris reached forward and turned off the ignition. His mother was gasping for breath, possibly unconscious, unable to get out of the driver’s seat. Her arm was badly cut, so Chris wrapped it in a blanket. Then he told her he was going to get help. Chris gathered supplies: binoculars, his mother’s flip phone, the van’s disconnected mirror. The hill was steep and the ground was loose. He slipped, fell back, scraped his knees. But he kept climbing until he got back to the road. There he found a welcome surprise: his dog Tanner, unharmed. (Jade had apparently run off into the canyon after the crash, but Chris thinks Tanner may have jumped out an open window just before the van started rolling down the hill.) Tanner was a big dog, perhaps 75 pounds, and he made Chris feel a little safer. They’d just started walking down the road when they saw the man. He wore black pants and a black sweatshirt. At first, Chris worried that Tanner might attack, so he looped the strap of the binoculars through Tanner’s collar. But Tanner seemed to know this man was not a threat. Chris’s parents had taught him not to talk to strangers, but these were extraordinary circumstances. Chris told the man he needed help. The man looked confused. Gradually, they both realized there was a language barrier. The man pulled out an ID card and pointed to his name.Manuel. He introduced himself as Manny. Chris knew a few words in Spanish, and he tried to explain the situation. The van was green, so he saidverde. It went down the hill fast, so he saidrapido. They both made hand gestures. Whatever meaning was lost, some things were easy to understand. It was cold, getting colder, and Chris was in shorts and a T-shirt. Manuel took off his sweatshirt and draped it around Chris’s shoulders. The man in black wasn’t alone when he left Magdalena de Kino. The picturesque Mexican town is a popular pilgrimage site that draws throngs of people every year for its feasts honoring Saint Francis Xavier and Father Kino, a Jesuit priest who founded many missions in the region. But on a November morning in 2007, Manuel Jesus Cordova Soberanes and about 30 others from Magdalena were making a trek of their own, leaving town in search of opportunities they couldn’t find at home. Work was hard to come by. Even decent jobs, like one Manuel had working in a factory making surgical scrubs, paid around$100 a week. Manuel was 26 years old. He’d been partying a lot and using drugs. But he was a father, too, and he knew he needed to support his family. He had two daughters already, and a third child on the way. So he met up with the group that was leaving that morning in November and headed toward the border, about 60 miles north. He planned to travel to a major city in Arizona and find whatever work he could. It wasn’t the first time Manuel had made the attempt. He’d been caught and sent back a few times before. This time, he left Magdalena determined that the journey would be different. This time, he was going to make it — and stay. For days, he’d been doing all he could to keep authorities from finding him. The group from Magdalena scattered across the desert whenever they heard voices or shouting, or any time someone caught a glimpse in the distance of flashing lights. At one point, Manuel burrowed under vegetation and hid for what felt like hours. Now, here he was, on his own, walking north. And here was something he never expected to see: a little boy standing on the narrow dirt road in front of him. Manuel thought of his own children. They were around the same age as Chris. He knew he’d want someone to do this for them. After giving the boy his sweatshirt, Manuel went down the hill to check on the woman. From outside the battered van, he could hear her breathing heavily. But he couldn’t see her or figure out how to reach her. He came to a devastating realization: There was no way to pry open the driver’s-side door, and even trying could make a perilous situation worse. The vehicle had rolled over into a canyon — but not all the way to the bottom. It was teetering like a seesaw on the slope of the ravine. Manuel tried to stabilize the van with branches and stones. There was still much further it could fall. Back on the roadside, he made a huge pile of wood and started a roaring fire, for warmth and a signal, in case someone out there might see it and bring help. He’d been hiding for days. But now his priorities had changed. Manuel was doing all he could to draw attention from the American authorities. Chris kept thinking about his mother, alone down there in the canyon, but the hill was too treacherous for a 9-year-old to navigate in the dark. So he curled up by the fire, using Tanner the dog as a pillow, and eventually he fell asleep. As the night went on, Manuel kept returning to the van to check on Chris’s mom. Although he couldn’t free her, he could still hear her breathing. And then, around midnight, on another trip to the van, he listened for her breathing and heard only silence. Back up on the road, the fire blazed, and the boy slept, and the long night passed. In the morning, two quail hunters came by in a pickup truck. Manuel flagged them down. They had a satellite phone. One called 911, and the call went through. With help on the way, Manuel could have headed on for Tucson or Phoenix. But something in him had changed in the night. His destination had shifted. He decided thatthiswas where he needed to be, waiting until an ambulance arrived to take Chris somewhere safe. The ambulance came. So did firefighters, who discovered Jade the dog nearby in the canyon as they were working to pull the van up the steep incline. Local and federal officials arrived at the scene, too. Manuel says they put him in handcuffs, but then apologized and removed them after speaking with Chris. “Forgive us, but it’s my job,” Manuel says a Border Patrol agent told him. “You are illegal here.” “No problem,” Manuel recalls saying. In a way, he was relieved to be heading home. He had just two requests: he needed a cigarette. And he asked if he could stay at the scene a little longer.He wanted to watch as rescue crews recovered the van. He was still holding out hope that somehow, Chris’s mother had survived. When they finally extracted her body from the wreckage, no one had to tell Manuel what had happened. He could see firefighters signaling to each other: She was gone. As Manuel headed back to the Border Patrol truck, he thought of his grandmother, who’d recently died, and his father, who’d recently had a stroke, and Chris’s mother, who he could not save. Tears began to fall. In the morning’s flurry of activity, Chris hadn’t had a chance to say goodbye to Manuel before paramedics took him away in an ambulance. But the firefighters at the scene who’d learned what Manuel had done for the boy found an unexpected way to bid him farewell. They erupted in a round of applause. It wasn’t long beforeManuel returned to Magdalena as quietly as he’d left. He didn’t tell anyone what he’d seen in the desert. Then, a few days after his deportation, his father came to him with a concerned question: “What did you do?” People from north of the border were looking for Manuel. The mayor wanted to meet with him. His father heard this from the mayor’s chauffeur, who happened to be his friend. Manuel told his father about the car crash, the little boy he tried to help and the mother he’d wanted to save. And together, they headed to city hall. Much to his surprise, less than two weeks after he’d been kicked out of the US, Manuel found himself crossing the border again — this time as a guest of honor inside the Nogales Port of Entry. Police officers, firefighters and diplomats were there to greet him. So was a gaggle of reporters who’d learned of the story and were eager to share it. Official after official presented him with plaques etched with his name, praising his courage and selflessness. The local fire chief gave him a small stuffed horse, telling Manuel he’d been a hero in the wilderness, like the Lone Ranger. Mexico’s top diplomat in the Arizona border city lauded Manuel for putting aside his needs and aspirations. “The desert,” she said, “has a way of rearranging priorities.” Manuel’s mother sat beside him, wiping tears from her eyes. There were so many things Manuel meant to tell people that day. But the would-be immigrant found his sudden and unexpected brush with celebrity overwhelming. When a TV camera panned in his direction, he smiled shyly and covered his face with a manila folder. And when Manuel finally had a chance to speak to the crowd, he could think of only one thing to say: “Gracias.” Manuel didn’t feel like a hero. His mind was on the people who weren’t there. News reports since the crash had filled in details about Chris’s life that Manuel hadn’t learned that night in the desert. How was Chris now, he wondered, and what would happen to the little boy who no longer had parents to care for him? When Chris Buchleitner was still a baby, his parents made a plan for the worst-case scenario. His dad, Jack Buchleitner, came from a huge Catholic family in Pittsburgh — he was one of 10 children — and one day Jack and Dawn called Jack’s sister Mary Butera with an unusual request. If anything ever happened to both of us, Chris’s father asked, would you take care of Christopher? “And I’m like, ‘Of course!’” his aunt recalled in an interview with CNN. And so, when somethingdidhappen to both parents, Mary and Vinny Buteradidtake care of Christopher. He moved to Pittsburgh and grew up there, surrounded by the large and loving Buchleitner family. Another aunt even took in the dogs, Tanner and Jade, and Chris visited them regularly for the rest of their lives. Chris never got over the loss of his parents. Years later, he told a friend it felt as if he had a hole in his chest. But he learned to accept his new life. After coasting for a while in high school, getting by on natural ability, he started working harder. He studied biology, as his mother had, and graduated in 2020 with a nursing degree from Duquesne University. Now 25, Chris works as a nurse at UPMC Shadyside hospital in Pittsburgh, specializing in heart patients. The job is stressful and challenging, with 12-hour workdays and the occasional loss of a patient, but the time passes quickly. Chris likes his coworkers, and his conversations with the people in his care. The boy who survived is now helping to save the lives of others. Despite the long shifts, Chris’s work schedule has its advantages. Going to the hospital only three days a week, he has four days open for exploration. Yes, he still loves the outdoors. He spoke with a reporter by phone on a recent Friday while on his way to Coopers Rock State Forest in West Virginia, where he planned to do some bouldering on the sandstone cliffs. His mother had big plans for him, spectacular places she wanted to take him. One was North Cascades National Park in Washington state, with its high glaciers and sharp mountain peaks. It was too dangerous for a 9-year-old. But in September, Chris went exploring in the North Cascades. And there, in the cold wind and the rugged beauty, he remembered her. These days, Chris doesn’t talk much about what happened back in 2007. Although his closest friends know all about it, most of his coworkers don’t. Still, he keeps thinking about Manuel, the man in black. Chris is almost as old now as Manuel was then. Sometimes he wonders what happened to the man who kept him safe. Even when he got older, he didn’t want to look up the old news stories. He figured they’d be too painful to read. He doesn’t know much about what happened to Manuel after that night. But if they ever met again somehow, he would say, “Thank you.” Because if Manuel hadn’t stopped to help, Chris says, “I don’t even know if I would have made it through the night.” Manuel never asked for the fame that briefly found him. But for months, even years, after that day in the desert, reporters kept calling. They’d show up out of nowhere at Magdalena’s city hall. Other strangers would, too. Manuel would get a call: “There are people here who want to meet you.” He’s well aware that some people see immigrants as criminals. He hopes in his story, people see the shared humanity that’s often lost in the debate. Manuel thinks he did what anyone would do in the same situation. But many others have told him that’s not what they see in his story. Accounts of the immigrant who sacrificed his dream to help a stranger on Thanksgiving Day are recited with mythic reverence. Ministersmention it in sermonsandop-eds praising selfless Good Samaritans. A writer-composer duo wrotea musicalabout it. And now, even 16 years later, some people in his hometown see him coming and shout out, “Look, it’s the hero of Magdalena!” Sometimes, Manuel thinks about how, instead of all the plaques and recognition, he would rather have stayed out of the spotlight and gotten a visa to work legally in the United States. Such perks aren’t without precedent. Victims of crimes and people who help with trafficking investigations are eligible forspecial visas. Several years ago in France, an undocumented immigrant scaled the side of a building to save a child dangling from a balcony. He was given citizenship andawarded a gold medal by President Emmanuel Macron. Arizona congressman Raul Grijalvaproposed a billthat would have given Manuel the chanceto live and work legally in the US. But the measure never made it out of congressional committee. Manuel says he never tried to cross the border again. The enthusiasm he once had for that journey lost its luster. And he found something unexpected within himself. Manuel is now living hours away from Magdalena in the border city of Mexicali, working in a bazaar. He says his life is dramatically different than it was on that night in the Arizona wilderness. “Before, with my drug addiction, I couldn’t talk with clients,” he says. “If a customer would come in, I’d run to the back. I couldn’t face people.” Now, when a customer walks in, he’s not scared to get up and greet them. He banters with them and exchanges pleasantries. He lets them look him in the eye. Within weeks of his return to Mexico, Manuel says, he put drugs behind him. And he credits the harrowing and heartbreaking night in the desert with helping him see the world and his place in it more clearly. Not as a hero, but as a man. “I was a mess. I was young. … It really changed my way of thinking,” he says. “Because beforehand, I only thought about myself. WhatIdid was what was important. Not anymore.” Manuel realized he’d been on the wrong path for years. He hadn’t been there enough for his kids and had even served jail time at one point for failing to pay child support. When he returned to Mexico, Manuel says he got closer with his family. He’s 42 years old now and has seven children and four grandchildren. He still thinks about Chris, wondering how he’s doing, or how it might have gone if they hadn’t met. And instead of wondering about an alternate future for himself in America, he wonders how life would be different if he’d happened upon a crowbar or another tool that could have pried open the van. Could he have saved Chris’s mom, too? Sometimes he wakes up in the night, grabbing the edge of his blanket. In his dreams, he’s still there at the van door, trying to pull it open. Over the years, the story faded from the headlines. But Manuel still fields questions. These days, they’re more likely to come from surprised friends who play on soccer teams with him in Mexicali and happen upon a photo of the ceremony he once shared on Facebook. “Just like the reporters…asking and asking,” Manuel says. Always with the same incredulous inquiries. Why did you stop? What was it like? If you could do it over again, would you make the same choice? That last one is easy for Manuel to answer. “One and a thousand times more,” he says. “Without thinking about it or doubting it.”"

Then the floods. In the small village of Sesklo in central Greece, 46-year-old Vasilis Tsiamitas has felt the extremes of both freak weather phenomena this summer, as Greece has become a climate change hotspot. Storm Elias flooded his house, damaged his beach bar and swept away his car in September. That finished off what was left weeks earlier by Storm Daniel, Greece’s most intense on record, and a July wildfire that scorched his family’s almond grove. “God only knows how I will get past this,” said Tsiamitas, standing outside his two-storey family house. The front door is off its hinges, propped up against a wall next to wooden boards soaked by floodwater. “What else could hit me? It can’t get any worse,” he said. Fierce storms and floods have become more frequent in recent years, while rising temperatures make summers hotter and drier, creating tinder-box conditions for wildfires. Muddy roads and household furniture, stacked up outside to dry, in villages across the central mainland region of Thessaly are a constant reminder of the steps Greece needs to take as it adapts to climate change and seeks to mitigate the effects of such freak weather events. Sesklo, a village of about 800 residents near the port city of Volos, and home to one of Europe’s oldest prehistoric settlements, has survived natural disasters through the centuries. But its oldest residents, Tsiamitas says, have never experienced anything like this year’s devastation. “It’s the first time that our village is tested so much,” said Tsiamitas, who is also the local community leader. “We have elderly people sitting at the village square who are 95 years old. They have never experienced such a thing before.” The wildfire that broke out in July was burning uncontrolled for at least two days. Sesklo residents were evacuated in time but the flames, fanned by strong winds, burned through farmland and groves, destroying approximately 70 percent of the village’s almond and olive oil production, said Tsiamitas. “The weather conditions were so bad, the wind, there was no humidity that day, the fire was moving fast. There was not enough time to do anything,” he said. In early September, Storm Daniel hit Thessaly after Greece’s longest heatwave in more than 30 years. It killed 16 people and turned the area into an inland sea, destroying homes, farms and wiping out swaths of crops. Tsiamitas, whose beach bar flooded, said most Sesklo residents were not as badly affected as others in the wider region. But their feeling of relief was short-lived. Weeks later, Elias, a less intense but unexpected storm, was the final straw. Tsiamitas recounts that he had his youngest son in his arms when a raging torrent flung his front door open, forcing him to race upstairs where his in-laws live. Since then, the water has subsided, revealing the devastation that villages like Sesklo suffered. “We should learn our lesson,” Tsiamitas said, looking at stumps of burned almond trees. “We need to uproot them … we need to plant them again. Again and again, we need to start everything from scratch.” Follow Al Jazeera English:"

There were no deaths reported, but several firefighters had sustained minor injuries including smoke inhalation, Western Australia state Department of Fires and Emergency Services Commissioner Darren Klemm said.

The cause of the fire is under investigation. The temperature in Perth was forecast to peak at 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) on Thursday — which is extraordinarily hot for the Southern Hemisphere spring — and winds remained strong. “Perth is experiencing … heat wave conditions. So overlay that on top of the fire and you can imagine the conditions that our firefighters and our support staff are working on. It’s really challenging,” Kuchel told Australian Broadcasting Corp. “Whilst we’re building containment lines on this fire, the conditions and the environment are such that even if we contain it, it may not be contained all the time. There may be breakouts. So it’s a really challenging and dynamic environment,” Kuchel added. Power poles had been damaged and 544 homes were without power Thursday. Around 130 people spent Wednesday night in an evacuation center, Western Australia Deputy Premier Rita Saffioti said.

The temperature is expected to hit a maximum of 40 degrees, and the winds continue to be strong. Today will be a difficult day for everybody,” Saffioti told reporters. Klemm said the 150 firefighters battling the blaze would take several days to bring it under control. In the northern Perth suburb of Tapping, Sarah Kilian and her husband stayed to defend their home over Wednesday night. Kilian said most of her neighbors evacuated as embers rained down on their homes. “Lucky my hubby stomped them out,"" Kilian said. “It was just scary all night — absolutely chaotic.” Scores of wildfires have recently raged across the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania as Australia’s driest September on record and unusually warm weather brought an early start to the annual wildfire season, which peaks during the Southern Hemisphere summer.

There were no deaths reported, but several firefighters had sustained minor injuries including smoke inhalation, Western Australia state Department of Fires and Emergency Services Commissioner Darren Klemm said. The fire began Wednesday afternoon in a pine tree plantation on Perth’s northeast edge and was fanned overnight by 60-kilometer (37-mile) -an-hour winds, incident controller Clinton Kuchel said. The cause of the fire is under investigation. The temperature in Perth was forecast to peak at 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) on Thursday — which is extraordinarily hot for the Southern Hemisphere spring — and winds remained strong. “Perth is experiencing … heat wave conditions. So overlay that on top of the fire and you can imagine the conditions that our firefighters and our support staff are working on. It’s really challenging,” Kuchel told Australian Broadcasting Corp. “Whilst we’re building containment lines on this fire, the conditions and theenvironmentare such that even if we contain it, it may not be contained all the time. There may be breakouts. So it’s a really challenging and dynamic environment,” Kuchel added. Power poles had been damaged and 544 homes were without power Thursday. Around 130 people spent Wednesday night in an evacuation center, Western Australia Deputy Premier Rita Saffioti said. “The forecast for today is unforgiving. The temperature is expected to hit a maximum of 40 degrees, and the winds continue to be strong. Today will be a difficult day for everybody,” Saffioti told reporters. Klemm said the 150 firefighters battling the blaze would take several days to bring it under control. In the northern Perth suburb of Tapping, Sarah Kilian and her husband stayed to defend their home over Wednesday night. Kilian said most of her neighbors evacuated as embers rained down on their homes. “Lucky my hubby stomped them out,"" Kilian said. “It was just scary all night — absolutely chaotic.” Scores of wildfires have recently raged across the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania as Australia’s driest September on record and unusually warm weather brought an early start to the annual wildfire season, which peaks during the Southern Hemisphere summer."

The large fire broke out at the Station Hill development site in the Berkshire town on Thursday morning. Crane operator Glen Edwards used a cage to rescue the workman, who was surrounded by flames and thick smoke. The fire service said: ""Without their actions, we may be looking at an entirely different scenario."" Wayne Bowcock, chief fire officer at Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue, said: ""I would like to add my thanks to the crane operator for an incredibly skilful rescue under extremely difficult circumstances."" Footage captured by bystanders showed the moment Mr Edwards, 65, used the winch he was operating to move a cage towards the workman. Crowds below broke out in applause as the man was lifted in the air and down to safety. Mr Edwards, who had been working at the site before the blaze broke out, played down his heroics. ""I don't want to blow it up too much, I'm not that sort of person,"" he said. By Alex Meakin, BBC News It's very quiet here, especially compared to how it was yesterday. There are a few roads directly around the building which are still closed, with fire and rescue tape up and steel fences still in place. The lights are on in the Station Hill development this morning and, as I look up at the building, the damage is clear to see seven or eight storeys up, where the glass is warped. It's shattered across two floors. You can see into the building, crystal clear, on the floors directly below the scar of where that fire was, but in the floors above that, light is dim - you can see the glass has been blackened and charred by the smoke. Another man was also lifted from the building by crane, firefighters said. South Central Ambulance Service said two people were taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation, but neither case was severe. Mr Bowcock added: ""On behalf of the service, I would like to extend our best wishes to the two people who were rescued from the building and wish them a speedy recovery."" Sir Robert McAlpine, the firm behind the build, said: ""We are immensely proud of those on site whose actions helped ensure a safe evacuation. ""Our site safety procedures and training for dealing with an incident of this nature worked and everyone is safe."" A spokesman for the construction and civil engineering company added: ""We are getting in touch with all those affected and are offering support from wellbeing professionals. Fortunately, incidents of this nature are extremely rare. ""The site has been safely secured and a thorough investigation is underway, meaning at this stage we are unable to comment further"". A HSE spokesperson said: ""We are aware of this incident and making enquiries."" The fire service said all other people had been accounted for. At 14:20 GMT on Thursday, the fire service confirmed the fire had been put out. At its peak, more than 50 firefighters were on the scene from fire stations across the county.

What chemicals created the burning-trash-barrel scent that has lingered since a deadly wildfire tore through Lahaina in August? Should he believe government agencies' assessment of when the air, land and water will be safe enough for his family to return? Or will political and economic pressures to rebuild and restore Maui’s robust tourism industry — where visitors normally spend $14 million per day — lead officials to look at any testing results through rose-colored glasses? “It appears very important to them to get that tourism tax revenue back,” said Skousen. “It makes you wonder if the testing will be biased.” The fire blew out Skousen’s windows and filled his home with ash, but the building is still standing, and he hopes someday to move back in. The home next door burned to the ground. Skousen wants a second opinion on any governmentenvironmental assessments, preferably from an expert with a stake in the community. But the raw data isn't easy to find, and experts say the long-term health effects from fires like the one that incinerated Lahaina are mostly unknown. There are no national standards that detail how clean is clean enough for a residential home damaged by a nearby fire. At least 100 people died in the Aug. 8 wildfire, and thousands were displaced. Nearly 7,000 were still in short-term lodging two months later. The rubble left behind includes electrical cables, plastic pipes and vehicle tires that emit dangerous dioxins when burned; lead from melted vehicles or old house paint; and arsenic-laden ash from termite-resistant building materials. After a major wildfire burned 1,000 homes in Boulder County, Colorado, in 2021, health officials learned that even professionally remediated homes were often still polluted with ash, char and other toxic substances long after the fire, said Bill Hayes, the county's air quality program coordinator. The reason? High winds — like those that plagued Maui during the wildfire this summer — forced fine particulate matter into every crevice, Hayes said. Those particulates would sit inside window panes, behind light switches, between shingles and elsewhere until the winds started up again, re-contaminating the home. “Char is a carcinogen, so we don’t ever say any level of those particulates are safe,” Hayes said. “That became a challenge in the cleanup – determining the level of when is it clean enough?” State and federal agencies have released regular updates on Lahaina’s relative safety. The water in much of the town is still unsafe to drink, and visitors have been advised to use protective gear in impacted areas. Officials say pregnant people and kids should stay out of the burn zone, though theHawaiiDepartment of Education says the schools, which are above the burned part of town, are safe. Crews have installed air quality monitors throughout town and are spraying a soil sealant to prevent toxic ash from being washed into the ocean or blowing around. An attorney representing Skousen and about two dozen other Lahaina residents sent a public records request to the Environmental Protection Agency last month asking for all records regarding residential testing of contaminants in Lahaina and their impact to human health. The EPA's reply, sent earlier this month, wasn't reassuring: “No records could be located that are responsive to your request.” EPA spokesman Kellen Ashford told The Associated Press his agency did some environmental hazard testing in the burn zone, but only to determine the immediate risk for workers involved in the initial cleanup. He referred further questions about such testing to theHawaiiDepartment of Health, which he said was responsible for determining longer-term safety for residents. The Hawaii Department of Health's Environmental Health Services Division also told Skousen's attorney it had no records about residential testing of contaminants to release. The Health Department declined interview requests. Spokesman Shawn Hamamoto said in an email the department will pursue additional air quality and ash testing when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers begins removing debris from Lahaina. “I think that they're playing ‘hide the ball,’” said Skousen's attorney, Edward Neiger. “The question is, why do they feel the need to hide anything?” Ashford acknowledged some residents are skeptical of the cleanup efforts. He said the EPA has people stationed at the Lahaina Civic Center and at work sites to talk to community members about their concerns. Andrew Shoemaker, a fine art photographer who operated a gallery on Lahaina’s famous Front Street, believes it's an important part of healing to go back to the burned areas to see what is left, but he has recently had a lung infection and doesn't want to risk his health. “I don’t even want to take the chance of going over there,” he said. Dioxins, toxic compounds that can be released when plastic pipes, tires and other household materials are burned, are a particular concern for Shoemaker. Dioxins can last for decades inside the human body, and can cause reproductive and developmental problems, damage the immune system, interfere with hormones and cause cancer, according to the World Health Organization. The EPA has found that forest fires and household trash burning in backyard burn barrels — how Skousen now describes the scent of Lahaina — are both major sources of dioxin emissions. Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a professor and environmental epidemiologist with University of California-Davis, said the air monitors are effective and can measure particles that are about 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Still, there is a lot that scientists don’t yet know about the long-term health risks posed by fires, Hertz-Picciotto said. That post-fire smell noticed by Skousen can be a result of off-gassing, she said, which occurs when volatile organic compounds are absorbed into surfaces and released later. Even with careful air quality monitoring, off-gassing can expose residents and cleanup workers to toxic fire emissions for months, and research shows only some volatile organic compounds can be trapped by high-quality air particle filters, according to the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. “If it smells like burned plastic or burned electrical cables, then probably those chemicals are in the air and not healthy,” Hertz-Picciotto said. “The other side of that, though, is even if you can’t smell it, that doesn’t mean it’s safe.” Skousen is a teacher and runs a cleaning business on the side. He’s spent his off hours in Lahaina working on cleaning his and his neighbors’ homes. Skousen and his wife decided to homeschool their kids at their temporary residence outside of Lahaina for now rather than risk exposing them to possible health problems. Most of the guidelines for human exposure to pollutants are based on industrial settings, where people might work 40 hours a week — not their homes, where they might spend 90% of their time, said Hayes, the Boulder County air quality coordinator. Whether a home can be made safe enough for residency comes down in part to the resident's risk tolerance, Hayes said. “There is no black-and-white, clear-cut answer,” he said. “If they have young children in the home, or anyone has respiratory conditions, they might want to do significantly more cleaning than what the guidance documents are recognizing.”"

For hundreds of years, people have shaped the world around them for their benefit: They drained lakes to protect infrastructure, wealth and people. They dug up billions of tons of coal, and then oil and gas, to fuel empires and economies. The allure of exploiting nature and burning fossil fuels as a path to prosperity hopped from nation to nation, each eager to secure their own energy. People who claimed the power to control nature and the energy resources around them saw theenvironmentas a tool to be used for progress, historians say. Over hundreds of years, that impulse has remade the planet's climate, too — and brought its inhabitants to the brink of catastrophe. Mexico City traces its roots to a settlement centuries ago on islands in the midst of Lake Texcoco. These days, most of the lake is gone, drained long ago to make room for the building and growth that today has more than 22 million people sprawling toward the edges of the Valley ofMexico. Getting water in the arid valley — a need that has spiked as droughts have worsened — relies on pumping from deep underground. The toll of centuries of such pumping can be seen in curbs that crumble and structures that tilt atop the resulting subsidence, with some areas sinking around 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) a year. At the same time, neighborhoods are at increased risk of severe flooding because of climate change-fueled extreme rain events and drainage systems that are less effective because of the subsidence. “Nature doesn’t create these huge problems,” said Luis Zambrano, professor of ecology at the National University Autónoma of Mexico. “Nature behaves as nature ... we are increasing our vulnerability by allowing the city to sink by pumping as much water as we possibly can from the aquifer."" Mexico City is just one example of people and empires altering their natural environments in ways they believe will benefit themselves and the land. Elsewhere, huge swathes of land have been deforested for agriculture or livestock grazing, or degraded and contaminated by quarrying and mining for metals and minerals. Tapping nature for its resources drove progress and productivity for some, but it's also been a major driver of emissions and environmental degradation. Anya Zilberstein, a historian of climate science at Concordia University in Montreal, highlighted the example of Europeans colonizing the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries as an early catalyst for modern-day climate and environmental crises. “They bring with them this idea that conquest and then the development of the cultivation of landscapes, like taking down trees, opening up lands to European style agriculture, that the draining of swamps ... will also change the climate, usually for the better,” Zilberstein said. The Aztecs built Tenochtitlán — what became Mexico City — on the lake's islands and chinampas — small, artificial fields. When the city later fell under Spain's rule, it was seen as the “most gorgeous jewel in the Spanish empire,"" with ornate palaces and commercial hubs, said Vera S. Candiani, a historian of Latin America at Princeton. Catastrophic flooding in the mid-16th century led the Spanish to pursue drainage projects that aimed to keep the city dry and prosperous, and stretched on for three centuries, Candiani said. But not everyone benefited equally. Candiani said that capital-owning elites got technicians, engineers and other professionals to implement a system of extracting resources and labor from the countryside to benefit the city in colonial Mexico, and more broadly from the colonies for the gain of the home country. Rural populations, who contributed the most to the project through coerced labor, didn't benefit. Jan Golinski, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire, said Europeans of the time thought that their changes — cutting down forests, draining swamps, plowing land — would change the climate as well, to something closer to their homelands. He said they saw this engineering as positive. “They believed that their society was making progress, that it was gaining greater control over nature, that they were becoming more civilized and were civilizing the environment around them,” Golinski said. It’s a belief that several historians say is rooted in feelings of racial and cultural superiority. “We hear echoes of these tropes"" in the present day, said Deborah Coen, a historian of science at Yale. Being more vulnerable to climate extremes is associated with populations of color, and at the same time, “we find white elites pursuing projects of climate adaptation that protect themselves at the expense of communities of color,” she said. For example, residents in areas that were deemed safer from extreme weather following wildfires in Maui this summer are now getting priced out of their own neighborhoods. The early modern period's ideas on race have “long tentacles into the present,” said Zilberstein, and also solidified notions of environmental control, productivity and growth as positive, making it harder to tackle the current climate crisis. “There are plenty of people who would say, yes, I believe climate change is real and I’ll go on a march, but I can’t accept de-growth,"" she said. “And I understand why businesses won’t commit to it and nations won’t commit to it. It’s sort of unfathomable. It goes against the deeply held ideology of progress.” While Mexico City was built over water, Britain was sitting on vast expanses of coal that would eventually help form the blanket of carbon dioxide emissions that now clogs the atmosphere. Coal had long been used in homes on the island for heating and cooking. It wasn't the only source of energy — timber, water and peat were in use as well — but the balance tipped dramatically in its favor through the late 18th and early 19th centuries through technological inventions like steam power, new transportation routes like canals and later railroads, and a desire to better control how, when and where energy was used. When the steam economy arrived — engines fueled by coal to heat water and make steam power — it made it easier for factory owners to control labor and nature than an economy based on water power, for example, said Andreas Malm, an associate professor of human ecology at Lund University in Sweden. “Steam engines were mobile in space, so you could erect them anywhere, and the great benefit of this was that you could concentrate steam factories in towns where there was access to cheap and disciplined labor power,” said Malm. Steam power was also less vulnerable to the droughts, floods and storms that could affect water power: “You could just turn it on at any point in the day, regardless of the weather outside.” It made coal the central energy-maker for British manufacturing and transport. “Britain forcibly exported this model and integrated other countries such as India or Egypt or what became Nigeria into a kind of an economy that was dependent on fossil fuel,” said Malm. By the mid-19th century, steam power was adopted in manufacturing, cotton mills, steam ships and locomotives around the world, turning coal into a global trade. On Barak, a historian at Tel Aviv University and co-founder of the Laboratory for the History of Climate Change, likened steam engines and coal to the British empire giving other states coffee machines and capsules. Nations consistently needed to buy new capsules, or coal, for their coffee machines, or steam engines, feeding an ongoing addiction. “This kickstarts ... searching for fossil fuels in various places in the Ottoman Empire, in the Indian subcontinent and elsewhere,” he said. And while it led to some discoveries, other empires and nations kept coming back to the more energy-rich British coal. Centuries later, the United Kingdom has nearly weaned itself off coal, with weeks or months at a stretch where the national grid gets no coal power. The U.K. plans to stop using coal for the production of electricity by the end of next year, although it’s still used in heavy industry like steel-making, with a new coal mine approved in Cumbria as late as 2022. But the country’s move away from coal wasn’t before its empire left its sooty footprint around the world. Its legacy can also be seen at home, where many of the mining and port towns in the north of England and parts of Wales and Scotland once buoyed by coal now languish, and abandoned mines and heaps of waste and debris scar the landscape. Previous centuries created the right conditions for human-caused climate change, but the last few generations made it a reality. In 1960, humans put about 9 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the air; in 2021, they produced more than four times that amount, according to the Global Carbon Project. Energy use skyrocketed as cars, air travel and technology became more affordable in many North American and European countries. Other nations such as China, Japan and India were assembling their own energy regimes based on fossil fuels. And this all happened amid growing understanding and concern about heat-trapping gases. Oil use grew in the late 19th century because it wasn't as labor-intensive as coal, an industry whose workers now had strong unions in some Western nations, historians say. Like coal, oil was easy to store. It is more energy-rich than coal, and it's easier to move; as a liquid it can be shipped through pipes, as well as by trucks, tankers and railcars, said J.R. McNeill, a historian at Georgetown University. The rise of automobiles in the 1920s led the U.S. to build its energy system and much of its technology around internal combustion engines that still dominate cars, ships and planes. And as Europe and Japan followed suit, it made the global investment in an oil-dominated fossil fuel regime “gigantic and harder, but not impossible, to reverse or replace,” McNeill said. Meanwhile, coal kept its place in the global economy. In China and Japan, growing consumption was a barometer of economic development by the early 20th century, said Harvard historian of science Victor Seow. After the Communist Revolution in 1949, the Chinese government measured growth by its production of items like cloth, electricity, wheat, iron, steel — and coal, too, which was key measure of growth. Japan studied Western mining to develop its own coal fields in both its home islands and empire. China is the world's current largest greenhouse gas emitter, although the United States still trumps it historically. In India, too, which was part of the British Empire until it gained independence in 1947, coal was used to further the country's development and help state governments win popular support, said Elizabeth Chatterjee, a historian at the University of Chicago. India set up state-owned coal-fired plants and started electrifying its cities and larger farms, with many other rural areas not coming online until the early 21st century. And they electrified while also understanding the environmental risks of coal, she said. “Indira Gandhi, as early as 1981, spoke publicly about climate change, for example, as a threat, but plowed on with this (coal) regardless,"" Chatterjee said. “If you're a country with few resources, what choice do you have?” In the United States, environmental issues started gaining traction in the 1960s and '70s, with the first Earth Day in 1970, said Joshua Howe, an environmental historian at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. He cited major legislation — to create the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Endangered Species Act — as “really big responses to that really big moment.” But tackling fossil fuels — what Howe called “the center of the global economy” — was more difficult. Yale's Coen described fear in the U.S. around discussing how to adapt to weather extremes caused by climate change that were already unavoidable in the late 20th century. Talking about adaptation was seen as a risk to detract from the will to slash emissions, she said. Howe also noted unwillingness to join international climate agreements, including a unanimous U.S. Senate vote in 1997 against signing any climate treaty that would mandate cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. That vote ""was, in my opinion, pretty much when optimism for a national-level commitment to climate mitigation — especially via international agreements — went up in smoke,” Howe said. But many historians agree, amid the gloom of spiraling concerns about the climate and environment, that radical shifts away from centuries-old ideas of progress can shape a better future. Fredrik Albritton Jonsson, a historian at the University of Chicago, said if humans rethink the need for persistent growth, societies can operate within the restrictions of finite resources and atmospheric limits. “There are two kinds of boundaries to this economy,” said Jonsson. “One is a sort of upper boundary of planetary limits” of what our natural world can withstand, “and then there’s a lower boundary, that would guarantee minimum social needs, entitlements, the right to education, the right to clean water, the right to a steady income.” ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

[+] that was destroyed by a wildfire on August 18, 2023 in Lahaina, Hawaii. New proposals from the Governor and Mayor will attempt to house displaced residents in vacation rentals. One way or another, you probably won’t be renting an Airbnb or VRBO on Maui anytime soon. This week, both the Governor of Hawaii and the Mayor of Maui indicated that the solution to finding long-term housing for the more than 6,000 residents still displaced from the August 8th Lahaina wildfire is to incentivize - or perhaps even force - vacation rental owners to rent to them. In separate proposals set to be heard soon by Maui officials, the Governor and Mayor laid out potential plans for short-term vacation rentals to be turned into long-term housing. First, the Governor. He laid out two options, which you can read in full here. In option 1, vacation rental owners would be (highly) motivated by the government to rent long-term to residents by offering them eye-popping, above-market rates: $5,000/month for a studio or one-bedroom home, or as much as $11,000/month for a four-bedroom home. In option two, short-term vacation rentals would be banned altogether for the next 18 months, while providing similar above-market compensation for renting to displaced residents. Both plans also include incentives for land owners to build accessory dwelling units on their properties to increase the total number of available solutions. The Mayor’s plan, while slightly less aggressive, would exempt vacation rental owners from paying property taxes if they rent to residents. However, vacation rental owners who do not follow suit would be taxed more, according to the proposal. “By converting short-term units to long-term rental properties, and renting them to residents who have been displaced by the disaster, owners of Maui’s thousands of short-term vacation rentals, timeshares, and non-owner-occupied homes will be exempted from paying real property taxes,” Mayor Richard Bissen said. In any of the above scenarios, vacation rentals would become more or less unavailable to visitors, either due to the legality or financial implications at play. The introduction of these ideas, which need to be debated and discussed by Maui county officials prior to approval, comes as residents continue to be removed from hotels without an approved plan for long-term housing while protests from local community groups take place on popular beaches. To say that Maui has been a mess in the wake of the August 8th wildfire that destroyed the town of Lahaina, killed about 100 people, and displaced thousands and thousands of residents would be an understatement. The reopening of Maui to tourists was anything but smooth, and the island’s tourism-dependent economy has struggled mightily to balance the needs of residents with the pocketbooks of visitors. Indeed, some Lahaina residents have been forced to leave Maui altogether due to the lack of affordable housing. Rebuilding Lahaina is projected to take a long time, with some economists warning that locals may be priced out if local zoning laws are not amended. Governor Josh Green echoed this fear when introducing his plans. “The main thing that has to happen is speed, which is not something Hawaii is known for,” he said."
