Published … [+6072 chars]",Pakistan,"A new study by researchers at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory looks at some of the influences that could be driving the increasingly severe weather over Pakistan.Published innpj Climate and Atmospheric Science,the studyanalyzed more than 40 years of data and found that natural climatevariability, which includes factors such assea surface temperatureand jet stream anomalies, accounts for over 70% of observed monsoon variability and extremes in Pakistan during the 21st century—withclimate changepotentially adding to their severity.Pakistan is no stranger to floods and droughts. However, these events have become more frequent and severe in recent decades—unprecedented rainfall in 2010 and 2022 caused catastrophic floods and landslides, and a drought at the beginning of the 21st century caused widespread famine.Climate scientists must quantify the influence of natural climate variability on theseextreme weather eventsto understand how and the extent to which climate change has contributed to this increased volatility.The study, titled ""The influence of natural variability on extreme monsoons in Pakistan,"" focused on precipitation variability in West South Asia, a region that includes Pakistan and parts of India. The South Asian climate is commonly studied due to the area's high population and strong monsoon season, which can bring up to 70% of the annual rainfall in a few months.The region is strongly affected by the pattern of sea temperature changes in the Pacific Ocean known as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. However, the areas of Pakistan most recently impacted by extreme monsoons typically receive very little rain during the summer, as rain-producing low-pressure systems dissipate by the time they reach the region. The severity of monsoon flooding in Pakistan in 2010 and 2022 suggests that extraordinary atmospheric conditions beyond ENSO have influenced recent weather patterns.""We know that floods and droughts occur naturally in this region,"" said Moetasim Ashfaq, a computational climatologist at ORNL and lead author of the study. ""Our motivation was to understand what is causing the change in their intensity. Is it natural variability or climate change or both?""Visualization of specific humidity (0.0123 KgKg-1) in the atmosphere colored by zonal winds. The strongest colors represent magnitudes greater than ± 10 m/sec. Warm (cold) colors represent eastward (westward) flow. The animation runs from July 1 to Aug. 31, 2022. The convergence zone of the winds represents the position of the monsoon trough. Credit: Moetasim AshfaqTo explore this question, the research team analyzed detrended monthly monsoon precipitation data from West South Asia as well as global land and ocean surface temperatures. Detrending removes large data trends, such as those driven by increasing global temperatures, that may obscure additional factors contributing to changing cyclical patterns.The team's analysis identified a combination of oceanic and atmospheric factors that impact the precipitation in Pakistan—including ENSO andsea surface temperaturesin the western Pacific and northern Arabian Sea—and internal atmospheric variability related to jet stream meandering, which is largely responsible for weather systems moving farther west over Pakistan.The analysis showed that the influence of these climate factors has increased during the 21st century, which Ashfaq suggests is due to their increased strength, simultaneous occurrence (called co-occurrence) or a combination of both.The co-occurrence of forcings has a particularly strong influence on precipitation variability, Ashfaq said. For example, when a moderate ENSO occurs with other forcings, such as jet stream meandering, it can impact precipitation in West South Asia more significantly than when it occurs alone. This phenomenon could explain why ENSO was more influential during the 2010 and 2022 flooding events.Althoughnatural climate variabilitycan explain more than 70% of the precipitation variability over Pakistan, Ashfaq explained that climate change may still play an indirect role. The increased variabilities in jet stream and sea surface temperatures and co-occurrence of multiple forcings may be caused by climate change. Additionally, more atmospheric moisture caused by warmerglobal temperaturescan lead to heavier rainfall, especially when combined with other dynamic forcings. However, further research is necessary to fully understand theimpact of climate changeon monsoons in Pakistan.""The link between climate change and extreme weather should be carefully evaluated,"" Ashfaq said. ""Climate change may have an indirect role in shaping the changes in the characteristics of identified forcings, but they're all part of naturally occurring variability in the atmosphere and the oceans.""Some of the identified mechanisms related to the internal atmospheric variability that influences monsoon extremes over Pakistan are less predictable, so forecasts of such events may be limited, Ashfaq said. For example, seasonal forecasting systems predicted above-normal monsoon rains over West South Asia for 2022, but the actual rainfall significantly exceeded the predicted amounts. Nevertheless, the insights into the natural climate drivers that impact summer precipitation at the western margins of the South Asian monsoon region could help future investigations of surrounding regions and the development of better predictive models.","['pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'india']",gb,False,False

Just a few years ago… [+5697 chars]",Pakistan,"Climate change is bringing about more devastation, forcing more Afghans to flee. Deportations from neighbouring countries will not stop them. This summer, I visited my village in Jaghori district in Ghazni province for the first time since 2017. I had never been so at ease while travelling from Kabul to my birthplace. Just a few years ago, undertaking this 260km trip meant risking one’s life. In 2009, for example, on my way to the village with some relatives, our car got caught in the crossfire of a battle between Afghan forces and the Taliban. We narrowly survived. This time around, I travelled without witnessing any explosions or fighting or being stopped and searched at a checkpoint. When I arrived, I was struck by how much my village had changed. I hardly recognised the place. It looked almost deserted. My relatives and friends had all left. The house I grew up in was occupied by strangers – internally displaced people from another province. The streets were empty; I saw just a few lonely children roaming around. The village of my childhood looked completely different. It was full of people and full of life, with crowds of children running in the streets and playing. Our favourite place was the local stream, which was surrounded by greenery and attracted all kinds of birds and small animals. There was a small dam, deep enough for us children to swim and play in. Women would come to the stream to chat and catch up on gossip while filling up their jugs with water to carry home. During prayer times, the men would also show up to do their ablutions. Water from the stream irrigated the nearby fields. Villagers grew wheat, potatoes, beans and other vegetables; they also kept orchards of apricot, apple and plum trees. Eager to remember those good times, I rushed to the stream, but what I found was devastating. Prolonged droughts had reduced it to a trickle. The green, lively valley of my childhood was no more; in its place lay a dry, silent strip of parched land. The fields lay mostly barren, as there was not enough water to irrigate them; I could see just a few orchards here and there still being kept. The once bustling community of 170 people now has no more than 40 left, most of them internally displaced people – too poor to make it to urban centres or abroad. I found a few of the original residents – old people, whose children and grandchildren had left for the country in search of a better life or had moved to bigger cities like Kabul and Herat. I felt nostalgia for the good old days, but also an uneasy premonition for what the future holds for my country. I realised that the depopulation and desolation I saw in my village are the reality in many places across rural Afghanistan. Decades of conflict have pushed almost a quarter of the Afghan population of 40 million to flee abroad. The return of security to the country after the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021 has certainly made a difference in the lives of many Afghans and given us hope for better times. It has enabled humanitarian access to all provinces, including the areas which had been out of reach for decades. But this has not resulted in refugees rushing to come back to the country. According to the UNHCR, some 1.3 million out of 4.5 million IDPs have returned to their home areas since August 2021 and some 6,000 registered refugees came back voluntarily to the country last year. The growing hostility against Afghans in neighbouring Iran and Pakistan, which host the majority of refugees from my country, has not resulted in a large movement of people returning home, either. The recent announcement of a crackdown on “illegal immigrants” by Pakistan’s Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti is likely to put more pressure on Afghan refugees. But many of them, especially those who lived in Pakistan for years, have no homes in Afghanistan to return to and would find it hard to survive in a country, where unemployment is rife. If the Pakistani authorities act on their threats and deport Afghans, it is unlikely many of them would stay in Afghanistan. They would most likely attempt to leave again. In response to the announced crackdown, the Taliban’s spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahidwrote on X: “The behavior of Pakistan against Afghan refugees is unacceptable. The Pakistani side should reconsider its plan. Afghan refugees are not involved in Pakistan’s security problems.” This indicates that the Taliban government also realises that the country cannot provide for a large number of returnees. Two years have passed since the war ended, but Afghanistan is still struggling to recover. Worse still, another menace is on the horizon, which is as dangerous as a conflict but cannot be resolved with arms. Climate change has stricken Afghanistan, prolonging droughts and shrinking the already limited water reserves of the country. Between 1950 and 2010, temperatures in Afghanistanrose 1.8 degrees Celsiuson average – about twice as much as the rest of the world. Rainfall across the country has fallen by as much as 40 percent. In 2018, as the war between the international coalition and the Taliban was still going on,droughts displacedsome 370,000 Afghans – as many as the conflict did. Dry spells have decimated the rural areas, destroying harvests and depopulating villages like my birthplace in Jaghori district. There is little hope for these areas. As the effects of climate change worsen in the coming years, the depopulation of Afghanistan will likely continue. People from rural areas will flock to the big cities, fleeing hunger and increasing exponentially the population of the urban poor. Those Afghans who have the means will continue to try to leave the country in search of better economic opportunities. Sadly, more unique places that used to be filled with life – like my village – will be lost.

[+] with ships as colorful objects. This is the Panama Canal like you’ve never seen it before. An image captured from space contains hundreds of ships on their way along a 50-mile journey between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This isn’t a single moment frozen in time. The confetti-like specks indicate ships moving through the waterway over the course of three years. The European Space Agency shared the fascinating satellite view of the famous canal on Friday. Hundreds of Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite radar images covering 2020 to 2022 are compressed together to create the view. ESA assigned different colors to the ships for each year, so blue is 2020, green is 2021 and red is 2022. Between 13,000 and 14,000 ships pass through the canal in a single year, according to the Panama Canal Authority. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission consists of two satellites. The orbiters peer down on Earth to monitor icebergs, flooding, drought, crop health, earthquakes and changes in Antarctica. “Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites carry radar instruments to provide an all-weather, day-and-night supply of imagery of Earth’s surface, making it ideal to monitor ship traffic,” ESA said in a statement.

Spending time with the image reveals patterns in ship movement, including favored gathering places for ships waiting to enter the canal. Look closer at the ocean surface above and below the canal to see a scattering of ships on approach or heading away to their ultimate destinations. ESA likened the ships to “shining jewels.” ESA has an interactive version of the image that you can explore by clicking on circles to zoom in on notable parts of the view. Highlights include Panama City (seen as a bright white area to the south) and Lake Gatun, easily spottable as a large, jagged-edged body of water near the northern side of the canal. Gatun supplies water that helps the canal function. It’s been a rough year for the lake. Severe drought in Panama has impacted the amount of freshwater available to fill the canal’s locks. That’s led to restrictions on ship traffic, and could even take a toll on holiday shopping in the U.S. The canal authority has whittled ships down from an average of 37 per day to 31 per day over the past month, ESA said. That has global repercussions for the movement of goods. A cargo ship navigates through the Panama Canal in the area of the Cocoli Locks, in Panama City on ... [+] Agust 25, 2023. (Photo by IVAN PISARENKO/AFP via Getty Images) The drought outlook remains grim. The Panama Canal Authority said water conservation measures are expected to remain in place into the 2024 rainy season, which typically runs from May through January. It’s one facet of how climate change is affecting the canal and global maritime trade. The Panama Canal is a marvel of engineering. It officially opened in 1914 and has since provided a valuable shortcut for vessels moving between the Atlantic and the Pacific. The canal acts as a connection point for 1,920 ports across 170 countries. The ESA multi-year satellite view communicates the scale of the Panama Canal and the tremendous load of ship traffic it handles every year. It also shows the versatility of the Sentinel-1 satellites. They can go from tracking the movement of icebergs to following the flow of maritime commerce.

The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) says it has been forced to make the decision due to the driest October since records began in 1950. The El Niño weather phenomenon has contributed to the severe drought, the ACP says. It is expected to increase the cost of shipping goods around the world. The Panama Canal greatly reduces the time and distance for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, between 13,000 and 14,000 ships use it annually, according to the canal authority. A naturally occurring El Nino climate pattern associated with warmer-than-usual water in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean is contributing to Panama's drought. Water levels in Gatun Lake, the rainfall-fed reservoir that is the main source of water used in the canal's lock system, have ""continued to decline to unprecedented levels for this time of year,"" according to the ACP. Starting from 3 November, booking slots will be cut to 25 per day from an already reduced 31 per day, the ACP said. That number will be further reduced over the next three months to 18 slots per day from the start of February 2024. In recent months, the ACP has imposed various passage restrictions to conserve scarce water. Earlier this year, authorities cut the number of ships passing through the canal for the first time ever. The measures already in place have caused long delays, with tens of ships having to wait to use the canal. Those delays have ""pushed shipping rates higher elsewhere by decreasing the globally available number of vessels,"" according to an analyst note from the US Energy Information Administration. Delays for some gas transporters were at record highs in Panama, pushing up the cost of shipping liquefied gas from the US, it added.","['panama', 'panama', 'panama', 'us']",gb,False,False

That ersatz … [+10938 chars]",Panama,"A rendering of a Crowley/BWXT nuclear ""power ship"" at work Almost a hundred years ago, the United States was the first country to use a ship to project electrical power ashore. That ersatz engineering effort helped a U.S. coastal community survive a crushing drought, and fueled development of an entirely new maritime platform. Today, as small modular nuclear reactors move from prototypes to reality, America stands, once again, on the threshold of a similar maritime power revolution, leveraging mobile sea “power” to help aid communities ashore. Many out there look to the U.S. Navy to move things along. But the Navy, while it leads the world in employing small nuclear reactors, makes an imperfect partner for today’s innovative ship-to-shore power platforms. The Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency—a department familiar with managing both nuclear risk and disaster recovery—is a far better choice to refresh America’s long-forgotten legacy of projecting power—electrical power—from the sea to shore. It will take funding and aggressive White House leadership to implement, but a FEMA fleet of nuclear-powered power generation vessels, built to bolster damaged or hurting electrical grids, can solve several pressing national issues. First, it can push civil development of nuclear power into the maritime. As a civilian, government-managed enterprise, a FEMA-managed disaster-response power-projection fleet can quickly bring new, clean, no-emission modular nuclear power plant designs to point where they are commercially viable. Second, by moving stewardship of this modern technology from the military sector to the civilian world, a FEMA disaster-response fleet gives the Department of Defense a much-needed civilian partner to help socialize the new technologies at sea. A civilian buffer between the Navy’s insular and secretive nuclear navy reduces risk of information loss while enabling wider and deeper public engagement. A FEMA power-generation fleet helps the military in other ways too. With a civilian assistance fleet, the military can avoid entanglement in unwanted portions the National disaster-response mission set. And yet, the military also gains a partner in helping to stabilize America’s strategically important territories and, potentially, some friendly island democracies. With DHS DHS already managing the U.S. Coast Guard, DHS administrators can follow a similar organizational template, aligning the civilian fleet for easy transfer to the Defense Department and preparing the oft-overlooked DHS shipyard in Baltimore for nuclear maintenance work. America needs this asset. Today, power is a more vital community lifeline than ever. In areas of instability, where disasters and conflict are now supercharged by powerful storms and abrupt climactic shifts, everything from basic economic development to disaster recovery is impossible without reliable and ready access to power. With several designs for new nuclear-powered electrical generation ships already on offer, a disaster-response fleet of reactor-equipped power generation vessels and barges makes sense. A disaster response fleet is a good way to justify operational evaluation of the various technical options out there. On a strategic level, the use case is simple. America’s island holdings and remote border states are more strategically important than ever. Beset by tropical storms, high energy prices and almost no political power in Washington, these isolated forward territories have struggled to maintain solid electrical generation infrastructure. Mobile power-generation platforms can do a lot to help when island power grids start coming apart. Put bluntly, power projection ashore is a critical unmet need in America’s geopolitical toolbox. America still hasn’t learned a lesson from twenty years ago. In 2003, America’s inability to quickly reconstitute the grid in Iraq’s urban areas was directly attributable to the emergence of civil unrest and resistance. Failure to reconstitute power—be it in hurricane-struck New Orleans, a beleaguered missile-hit Kyiv, or in the streets of Apra, Guam, power generation is the coin of credibility for modern societies and governments. As aid and assistance, electrical power is one of the most high-yield investments any country can make. The newly-constructed USS Lexington was one of the first maritime platforms to project electrical ... [+] power ashore America Has A Legacy Of Projecting Power Ashore After Emergencies: The Administration may struggle to justify the investment this new, low-emission technology. Efforts to grapple with extreme weather and rapid climate shifts is controversial fare for Congress, but America’s century-long record of using power ships and barges to address climate challenges is undeniable. The only problem is that nobody in Washington knows industrial history. America’s long and proud record of employing safe, maritime power generation is largely forgotten, and the industry itself is ignored. America has a strong record of success in afloat power generation. In 1929, after a severe drought cut hydroelectric generation sources in the Pacific Northwest, one of America’s first aircraft carriers, the USS Lexington (CV-2), powered the city of Tacoma for a month. For the Tacoma area, that electricity prevented economic disaster. It helped America’s national security too, by keeping the lights on at what today is now Joint Base Lewis-McChord. The world’s first power generation barge, the converted merchant ship SS Jacona, was converted in 1930, after a winter storm destroyed major transmission lines in the northeast. After supporting power generation needs in northern New England, it supplied power to Hawaii, South Korea and Okinawa before being sold in 1971. The world’s first floating nuclear power plant, the MH-1A Sturgis (formerly the Liberty-class cargo ship SS Charles H. Cugle), generated power in Panama from 1968 to 1976, helping the Canal Zone weather a drought that limited access to hydroelectric power. With the Suez Canal closed, and the Vietnam conflict raging, the Panama Canal was breaking traffic records and needed the extra electricity to keep the locks operating. The Navy’s legacy fleet of about 14 floating power barges—a grab bag of designs ranging from purpose-built barges to converted tankers, converted cargo ships, or even dry dock sections hosting an array of different types of generators—have faded from memory. Only a few people realize U.S. power barges were prototype platforms testing all kinds of operational scenarios. America’s power barges and power ships have been used to power everything from tropical islands to Distant Early Warning radars out at Thule, Greenland, near the Arctic Circle. In World War II, alone, seven destroyer escorts were converted to serve as floating power-ships/power barges. Up until the seventies and eighties, America used World War II-era power barges and power ships to power war-hit cities, keep critical ports open, radar sites operational and even to dredge strategic anchorages and fleet concentration areas. With a high-profile fleet of FEMA power-generation ships, the U.S. can recover this lost chapter of America’s industrial legacy. By gaining operational time and experience with modular reactor designs, the U.S. government can use a wide-ranging FEMA fleet to refine modern operational and regulatory expectations. A perfect application for America’s romantic pragmatism, this new disaster response fleet can set the groundwork for wider maritime exploitation of clean, safe modular nuclear reactors. A conventional power barge arrives in Cuba. If America does not act, China, Turkey or some other ... [+] fast-moving country will fill the vacuum. The Business Case For An American Nuclear “Power Projection” Fleet: A true “power projection” fleet makes sense, particularly for America’s strategically-important forward territories. In Puerto Rico alone, FEMA, after a series of storms and earthquakes, has obligated more than $9.4 billion to keep the island’s battered electrical system operational. At that level of investment, America could have fielded several powerships—platforms that would be available today for activities beyond just supporting Puerto Rico. Mobile “power-projection” support at sea is needed. Today, the strategic islands of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are America’s front-line communities. But they are in typhoon country too. It’s simply inappropriate and strategically silly to let these power grids struggle after a disaster or wallow in management challenges. The island grids break often. In 2015, Typhoon Soudelor compromised Saipan’s 104-megawatt power grid. In 2018, two super typhoons ripped through Saipan, Tinian and Rota, disrupting power on those islands for months. Right now, Guam is still trying to recover from a 2015 explosion and fire at their main Cabras power plant. It is simply unacceptable that, today, Guam faces regular rotating blackouts. But the list of power generation problems facing Guam is enormous. Critical base-load combustion turbines require a hot exchange and repair in the Continental United States. The generation facility to replace the broken Cabras generation complex is behind schedule, with typhoon damage pushing that start back almost two years—to the end of 2025. Procurement protests have shaved production from other important generators by 75%. The situation is critical. Right now, Guam has 234 megawatts of generation capacity while Guam’s peak demand is in the vicinity of 220 megawatts. Certainly, conventional floating power plants can provide the same support. But, unlike nuclear power generators, they can’t do it alone. Conventional power plants need fuel, and that means added infrastructure, a fuel supply, and potentially more ships to carry fuel oil, diesel, gas, biofuel, or some type of natural gas, or maybe, in the future, methanol, ammonia or hydrogen. For a disaster-hit site, thousands of miles from anywhere, the logistical cost adds up. Fuel surcharges—particularly for remote regions—can boost retail energy prices by 400-500 percent. In an emergency, those costs are even higher. Floating nuclear power plants make political sense. The Secretary of the Navy, Carlos Del Toro, is proposing something a lot of us have been urging for a long time—a “new maritime statecraft,” integrating the various aspects of America’s maritime power into a cohesive, unified whole. It’s time for the Administration to put its money where its mouth is. This call to introduce a new agency into America’s wider maritime family, using it as an opportunity to both revitalize America’s waterfront as well as to help jump-start America’s nascent nuclear industry—while bolstering the islands and towns on the front lines of an increasingly contested maritime—is an easy win. And if we don’t move on it, right now, China, where researchers are busy producing engineering papers exploring the technical challenges of restarting dead electrical grids on islands, will.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'iraq', 'southkorea', 'panama', 'vietnam', 'greenland', 'cuba', 'china', 'china', 'turkey', 'puertorico', 'puertorico', 'guam', 'guam', 'guam', 'guam', 'guam', 'guam', 'australia']",us,True,True

Now, I’d like to share six key trends that are likely to affect shipping and logistics in 2024 and beyond. 1. Digitalization Although digitalization in shipping has been talked about for a long time, by next year, it will finally be a reality for many shippers. The bottom line is that the Covid pandemic and transition to remote work forced the shipping and logistics industry to digitalize. Big shipping players such as Maersk, MSC, Hapag-Lloyd and others digitized. But something miraculous happened: Boutique shipping companies also digitalized, and in many cases, they implemented their own software systems and tools for their customers. Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology could further digitalize and automate the world of shipping. It is expected that developments in those areas will improve real-time shipment tracking and supply chain visibility to build on the software that has already been deployed in the industry. Another massive move toward digitalization is the introduction of paperless shipping. At freight forwarders such as MTS Logistics, we are 100% paperless as of 2023. Others are following suit, as digital platforms take a greater role in shipping. 2. Economic Headwinds After a rocky pandemic-era economic period and post-Covid economic shockwaves, every businessperson hopes that tough economic times are behind us. There are many aspects of the economy to feel confident in: rising wages, steps toward a reduced income gap, reduced regulations and, yes, inflation finally starting to decrease. However, many challenges remain. Inflation is not yet low enough that shippers can increase their revenue and profits without increasing costs. In Q3 2023, fuel prices rose dramatically, and that has been passed down to major ocean shipping lines. With Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ countries having reduced global oil production, more volatility is likely ahead in 2024. 3. Sustainability Sustainability and greener business practices have been discussed for years. But with frequent and costly natural disasters becoming the norm amid a changing climate, the shipping and logistics industry has started to step up and take bold steps. There have been regulations implemented by global shipping regulators such as the International Maritime Organization’s “IMO 2020” rule, requiring cleaner fuel and retrofitted emissions scrubbers installed on older vessels. By 2024, more bold action will likely have been announced. Water shortages, such as the low water levels seen this year in the Panama Canal, and excessive drought throughout the western United States, are here to stay. Ports all over the world have been forced to suspend operations periodically due to climate-related events. The private sector has stepped up over the past few years with initiatives to promote zero-carbon shipping by 2050 (and in some cases sooner). Shipping leaders such as Maersk have led the way, and new ships are being built with electricity and alternative fuel sources in mind. Still, it will be a while until logistics is completely green. 4. Last-Mile Delivery The last-mile delivery ecosystem has changed rapidly over the past few years, and by 2024, major U.S. retailers will have taken steps to take over many aspects of their last-mile delivery operations. Over the past few years, Walmart, Target and Home Depot all expanded their last-mile delivery options, opting to take over some operations from existing carriers in order to offer services like faster deliveries. Many retailers have also opted for same-day delivery offerings. With regulations and oversight having been implemented, autonomous delivery solutions, such as self-driving trucks, could enter real-world use as early as 2024. Last-mile delivery continues to be a challenging part of logistics, especially after supply chain issues in 2021 and 2022. Major companies are exploring partnerships with new fulfillment partners and even taking on last-mile delivery themselves. That trend should continue. 5. Supply Chain Resilience The Covid pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains. In response, companies are rethinking their supply chain strategies to enhance resilience and implement risk management. This includes diversifying suppliers, changing how goods are sourced and, for some companies, just having a plan. Analytics is becoming even more important and will play a big role in identifying potential risks and associated responses. 6. Cybersecurity As the shipping and logistics world digitizes, cybersecurity is becoming more important than ever. In 2024, it is likely that the shipping industry at-large, as well as related partners, will invest heavily in cybersecurity. The United States has invested in cybersecurity for government operations, and the private sector has started to do so on a vast scale. Now, it will be time for shipping to do the same as more sensitive data is moved into the cloud and shippers realize that cyber risks have grown exponentially since the Covid pandemic. The industry is likely to invest heavily in cybersecurity to protect sensitive data, safeguard cargo from theft and prevent cyberattacks that threaten operations. Multifactor authentication will continue to become the norm in shipping and logistics, as it has in other industries. As an experienced shipping professional, I have watched the beginnings of each of these six trends take hold in recent years. I have no doubt that 2024 will be a year of profound investment and focus on the future in the areas of digitalization, sustainability, last-mile delivery, supply chain resilience and cybersecurity. At the same time, the global economy will pose new challenges for the shipping and logistics industry.

91811,,NPR,Ashley Westerman,The Philippines' capital is running out of water. Is building a dam the solution?,Officials say the Kaliwa Dam will help alleviate an impending water shortage in the capital that's being exacerbated by climate change.

They use the boulders to perform rituals to ward off sickness and keep their village safe. If the Kaliwa Dam is built upriver, the Dumagat say these rocks will be destroyed to make way for the increased water flow.Ashley Westerman/NPRhide caption DARAITAN, Philippines — Nestled in the Sierra Madre more than two hours outside Manila, this village is lush and green — brought to life by the Agos River, which cuts through the unforgiving terrain like a quiet, slow-moving highway. Daraitan is a tourist village of about 5,000, where children play in the river while the adults cook fish and fix their broken karaoke machines under makeshift tents on the banks. ""The community is peaceful. We have everything we need here,"" Maria Clara Dullas, 43, tells NPR. Dullas is a member of the Indigenous Dumagat people, who claim this area as their ancestral lands. Her family are farmers, like most in the area, and have lived off the land and the river for centuries. But Daraitan is in danger of disappearing, under the waters that give it and its people life. Some 40 miles downriver, the sprawling Metro Manila area and its more than 13 million people are facing a looming water shortage. It's the result of an exploding population, human-caused climate change and, some would argue, poor planning on the part of officials over the years. The Philippine government commissioned the building of the Kaliwa Dam on the Agos River decades ago as part of a larger plan to help get more water to Manila. But construction finally broke ground last year, as officials amped up claims that the dam would alleviate water shortages that could hit the capital as early as next year. Dullas, who is the president of Dumagat Women of Sierra Madre, has been leading the fight against the building of Kaliwa Dam for years. Though the dam will be built more than 6 miles upriver, once completed, the new water flow will submerge Daraitan and destroy precious sacred sites in the area, Dullas says. Despite her and her community's efforts, the project is moving forward. ""It hurts us. It's devastating,"" she says. Children play in the Agos River in the tourist village of Daraitan in the Philippines' Rizal province. In late April, temperatures are high and the humidity is stifling — driving tourists and residents alike into the river's cool, running waters.Ashley Westerman/NPRhide caption ""This is just a matter of supply and demand projections,"" Delfin Sespene, supervising engineer at Manila's Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewage System, tells NPR. ""We are building the Kaliwa Dam to augment our water supply in order to meet an increasing water demand."" From dams in the Philippines tosea walls being built in Norfolk, Va., clashes are playing out all over the world as people try to adapt to the threats from climate change. The choices are acute in the global south: countries there, like the Philippines, are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather, but they often lack the resources or civil society safeguards to make sure solutions help people equitably. The search for climate solutions frequently lays bare the fact that there could be winners and losers when it comes to decisions about protections and development. And in the case of dams like Kaliwa, it spotlights some shortcomings of a climate change solution that has been touted for decades. The Kaliwa Dam was proposed as a project in 2012, and it's part of a larger group of water supply projects centering on the Kaliwa River Watershed that have been in the works since the 1970s. The construction of the Kaliwa Dam finally began in 2022, three years after the Philippine government secured a development loan from China. Today, officials say that if the dam is not built, the water crisis will leave the capital area without an adequate water supply starting next year, with a severe shortage by 2027 — the year officials say the first phase of the dam will be completed. ""One of the battles is the increasing population, so there will be an increasing water supply demand,"" Sespene says. According to the Philippine Institute for Development Studies, Filipinos use between 48 and 108 liters per day. So as Manila's population rises every year, the current water supply cannot keep up, he says. The Metro Manila area is home to more than 13 million people. Officials say the megalopolis may begin to experience a water shortage in 2024 that could become extreme by 2027.Veejay Villafranca/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide caption But there's another driver of the water shortage: the anticipation of the next El Niño, a naturally occurring weather pattern that has to do with the ocean getting warmer along the equatorial Pacific. El Niños are known to bring less rain, which means ""there will be less rain for those dams that impound water for Metro Manila,"" Sespene says. There is currently an El Niño affecting weather worldwide, but Philippine climate scientists and officials expect upcoming ones to be worse. Climate experts say man-made climate change will exacerbate the effects of future El Niño events. ""The El Niño will be more intense and for us in the Philippines, that would actually mean like 46% of the country would suffer a dry spell,""Angelo Kairos Torres Dela Cruzwith the Manila-based Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities says. The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable countries when it comes to climate change,according to the United Nations.Along with droughts, the archipelago nation has also experienced sea level rise, ocean acidification and more extreme weather events, such as multiple devastating typhoons in recent years. In 2020, more than 4 million Filipinos were displaced because of the effects of global warming, the 2021 Global Report on Internal Displacementsaid. And soon millions may not have enough water. But building the Kaliwa Dam is not a ""silver bullet solution,"" Dela Cruz says. ""It could have a role to play because it has scale. It's bankable; it can be invested in real quick,"" he says. ""But it shouldn't happen at the expense of other equally important issues. For example, Indigenous peoples' rights, forest and land degradation, and so on."" The Agos River cuts through the Sierra Madre in the Philippines' Rizal Province. Officials hope to build a new dam upriver from the village of Daraitan to increase the water supply to the capital, Manila. But the project threatens the environment and people who live downstream.Ashley Westerman/NPRhide caption While dams are often billed as a drought-protection measure and a renewable energy source, they have also been known to contribute to climate change — such as emitting a lot of planet-heating carbon dioxide and methane when the lakes created by dams suffocate and kill vegetation, releasing those gases into the air. Dams can also intensify drought by diverting water from rivers and increase the risk of flash flooding by releasing too much water during storms. Brian Eyler, director of the Stimson Center's Southeast Asia Program, says dams have to be built and operated in a sophisticated manner. ""Dams are just kind of Band-Aids,"" Eyler tells NPR. ""Because the weather is going to become so much more extreme, to the point that it's hard to predict how to design a dam for that future extremity."" But in the Philippines, people seem more distracted by other things concerning the Kaliwa Dam, such as how much the dam will cost to build and who is paying for it. Dela Cruz says the connection between the dam and how it could possibly be a solution to climate change is also not being made explicitly. ""I think the discussion has not matured enough to allow a more nuanced discussion about how a dam can be part of a broader resource management system in the Philippines,"" he says. Maria Clara Dullas (far right) and other community leaders of the Indigenous Dumagat community wash their faces in the Agos River. Their people, mostly farmers, have lived off the river for generations.Ashley Westerman/NPRhide caption The existence of climate change is not up for debate in the Philippines. But how to adapt to it and integrate those adaptations into the nation's development plans is still an open, often hotly contested question — a familiar struggle that is taking place across the globe. Maria Clara Dullas of Daraitan doesn't feel like her Indigenous Dumagat community is being included by the Philippine government in discussions or decisions about development or climate change adaptation. ""We aren't against progress,"" she says. They just don't want to see their homes destroyed. But while the national government has offered the entire village the rough equivalent of a little over $1.4 million to relocate, Dullas says she cannot imagine leaving home. ""We keep saying we don't want to benefit from the dam,"" she says. The Dumagat people just want what is theirs: the land. Loading...

More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm. Some children, like 10-year-old Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim, are already on the move. Her family left their home in Somalia after dawn prayers on a Saturday morning five months ago. The worst drought in more than 50 years scorched the once-fertile pastures the family relied on, leaving them barren. So, bundling only a few clothes and some utensils into sacks, they moved to a camp in the capital Mogadishu, where Ibrahim, who dreams of being a doctor, is now going to school for the first time. That’s a plus, but the camp lacks proper shelter and sanitation, and food is scarce. “We need something that can protect us from the heat during the day and the cold at night,” Ibrahim said. Read more:U.N. Climate Warning Also Comes With Clear Steps To Cut Emissions The miseries of long, drawn-out disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report — more than half of them in Somalia — but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no pre-emptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide,climate changehas already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines; storms are battering megacities and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. “The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in (the) future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify,” said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the report's authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 2016-21 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. Floods displaced children more than 19 million times in places like India and China. Wildfires impacted children 810,000 times in the U.S. and Canada. Data tracking migrations because of weather extremes typically don't differentiate between children and adults. UNICEF worked with a Geneva-based nonprofit, the International Displacement Monitoring Center, to map where kids were most impacted. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. Those countries also have vast populations and strong systems to evacuate people, which makes it easier for them to record data. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring “overlapping crises” — where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. During unprecedented flooding of the Yamuna River in July in the Indian capital New Delhi, churning waters washed away the hut that was home to 10-year-old Garima Kumar’s family. The waters also took her school uniform and her school books. Kumar lived with her family on sidewalks of the megacity and missed a month of school. “Other students in the school teased me because my house had been flooded. Because we don’t have a permanent home,” Kumar said. The floodwaters have receded and the family began repairing their home last month — a process Garima’s mother Meera Devi said they are having to do over and over again as floods are becoming more common. Her father, Shiv Kumar, hasn’t had any work for over a month. The family's only income is the mother’s $2 daily earnings as a domestic helper. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnam-based expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasn’t involved with the report. “When you’re desperate, you do things that you normally wouldn’t do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they don’t have the ability to stand up for themselves,” she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become “shock-responsive, portable and inclusive,” to help children and their families better cope with disasters. This would mean considering children’s needs at different stages, from ensuring they have opportunities to study, that they can stay with their families and that eventually they can find work. “We have the tools. We have the knowledge. But we’re just not working fast enough,” Healy said.","['somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'philippines', 'philippines', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'china', 'china', 'us', 'canada', 'switzerland', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'vietnam', 'vietnam', 'bangladesh']",us,True,False

More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released on Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm. The miseries of long, drawn-out disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report — more than half of them in Somalia — but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no pre-emptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide, climate change has already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines; storms are battering cities, and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. “The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in (the) future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify,” said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the report's authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 2016-21 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring “overlapping crises” — where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnam-based expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasn’t involved with the report. “When you’re desperate, you do things that you normally wouldn’t do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they don’t have the ability to stand up for themselves,” she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become “shock-responsive, portable and inclusive,” to help children and their families better cope with disasters. This would mean considering children’s needs at different stages, from ensuring they have opportunities to study, that they can stay with their families and that eventually they can find work. “We have the tools. We have the knowledge. But we’re just not working fast enough,” Healy said.","['somalia', 'philippines', 'philippines', 'india', 'india', 'china', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'vietnam', 'vietnam', 'bangladesh']",eu,False,False

That works out to 20,000 children displaced every single day due to extreme weather fueled by climate change. The researchers found that floods and storms caused 95% of all child displacements recorded, with the rest due to drought and wildfires. “It is terrifying for any child when a ferocious wildfire, storm or flood barrels into their community,” said UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell, in a statement. Thereportis the first of its kind, according to UNICEF. “Until now, children displaced by weather-related events have been statistically invisible,” the organization said in a statement. East Asia and the Pacific have been particularly affected. In 2020,Cyclone Amphanled to 1.5 million child displacements across India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Bhutan. In 2021,Typhoon Raicaused 1.5 million child displacements across the Philippines, Palau and Vietnam. By overall numbers of displacements, three countries dominated: the Philippines, India and China, where a total of 23 million children were forced from their homes and schools across the six-year period. The location and geography of these countries make them prone to floods and storms, which are set to worsen as the climate crisis intensifies. However, the report noted that all three countries implement preemptive evacuation plans, meaning children can be moved before a disaster hits, which may account for the higher numbers of displacements. A different picture emerges when looking at the number of children displaced relative to the size of each country’s population. Storms in the small Caribbean island country of Dominica, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017, displaced 76% of the child population over the six-year period. South Sudan and Somalia experienced the highest proportion of child displacement from flooding, with 11% and 12% of children having to flee their homes, the report found. Both countries implement far fewer evacuation plans, making children even more vulnerable, according to the report. Meanwhile drought, particularly in Somalia, Ethiopia and Afghanistan has contributed to over 1.3 million children having to leave their homes. However these statistics are likely to be conservative, as there is less data available for slow-onset disasters like drought, the reported noted. Wildfires in the US and Canada have also led to child displacement, and they are likely to cause larger-scale displacements in the future, the report found. “For those who are forced to flee, the fear and impact can be especially devastating, with worry of whether they will return home, resume school, or be forced to move again. Moving may have saved their lives, but it’s also very disruptive,” UNICEF’s Russell said. Whether short-lived or long-term, displacement can amplify risks of exploitation, child trafficking and abuse, while also exposing children to malnutrition, disease and inadequate immunization, the report found. The situation is poised to get worse. As the human-caused climate crisis accelerates, extreme weather is becoming more severe and more common. With every additional 1 degree Celsius of warming, the global risks of displacement from flooding are projected to rise by 50%, according to research cited in the report. “We have the tools and knowledge to respond to this escalating challenge for children, but we are acting far too slowly,” Russell said.","['india', 'india', 'bangladesh', 'myanmar', 'bhutan', 'philippines', 'philippines', 'palau', 'vietnam', 'china', 'dominica', 'southsudan', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'ethiopia', 'afghanistan', 'us', 'canada']",us,True,False

By Subel Rai Bhandari for RFA 2023.10.06 -- More than 43 million children were internally displaced over six years due to climate change-exacerbated, weather-related disasters, with China, India and the Philippines leading the chart in absolute numbers, a U.N. agency said in a new report. ""While the link between climate change and displacement is complex, it's clearer than ever that the climate is shifting patterns of displacement,"" UNICEF said Friday in a statement, releasing the report, ""Children displaced in a changing climate."" Between 2016 and 2021, the U.N. Children's Fund said 43.1 million youngsters - or about 20,000 child displacements a day - across 44 countries were displaced in the most common weather-related hazards, including floods, storms, droughts and wildfires. Floods and storms drove 95% of recorded child displacements. It was unclear how many of the 43 million children were, in fact, preemptive evacuees, as opposed to displaced for the short or long term. ""It is terrifying for any child when a ferocious wildfire, storm or flood barrels into their community,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. ""For those who are forced to flee, the fear and impact can be especially devastating, with worry of whether they will return home, resume school, or be forced to move again. Moving may have saved their lives, but it's also very disruptive."" ""As the impacts of climate change escalate, so too will climate-driven movement."" The report said 9.7 million child displacements in the Philippines alone, 6.7 million in India, and 6.4 million in China were due to all four hazards combined. The numbers were high due to geographic locations, exposure to extreme weather, large child populations, and progress made on early warning and evacuation capacities. Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Vietnam came fourth, eighth, and ninth in the top-10 ranking based on absolute numbers, with 3.3 million, 960,000, and 930,000 children respectively displaced between 2016 and 2021. Relative to the size of their child population, Dominica (76%) experienced the largest number of child displacements from all four disasters. The list included Vanuatu, the Philippines, and Fiji. Between 2016 and 2021, floods displaced roughly 19.7 million children globally. India (3.9 million), China (3.7 million), and the Philippines (1.3 million) were hardest hit. Similarly, storms led to the displacement of about 21 million children, with the highest numbers in the Philippines (8.3 million), India (2.8 million) and China (2.6 million). Asia and the Pacific frequently experience storms, leading to mass evacuations. In 2020, Cyclone Amphan displaced 1.5 million children in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Bhutan, while Typhoon Rai (Odette) displaced 1.5 million children in the Philippines, Palau, and Vietnam in 2021. Droughts caused over 1.3 million child displacements in 15 countries, with 730,000 in Somalia, 340,000 in Ethiopia, and 190,000 in Afghanistan. Wildfires, which primarily affected the Americas, displaced 810,000 children between 2016 and 2021, with the United States, Canada, and Israel seeing the highest child displacements at 610,000, 47,000, and 31,000, respectively. Using a disaster displacement risk model, the UNICEF report predicted that riverine floods may displace an average of 3.2 million children annually, totaling 96 million over 30 years. Cyclonic winds follow, potentially displacing over 10.3 million children, while storm surges might account for 7.2 million displacements in the same three-decade span. ""Given their large population, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Philippines and China are the five countries with the most predicted future displacements of children owing to all hazards combined (riverine flood, cyclones and storm surges),"" the report said.

Overview of Second Quarter Financial Results International・The shipping market was on a downtrend until July due to concerns over the slowdown of the Chinese economy, but Shipping recovered from September onward due to a recovery in demand of iron ore and grains from Brazil, and a decrease in the number of vessels due to restrictions on passage through the Panama Canal, which tightened the supply-demand balance and led to a reversal of the upturn. VLGC (Very Large Gas Carrier) market maintained a high level. ・Although profits declined compared to the previous fiscal year, profits reached a record high, due in part to the impact of falling market conditions. the Company secured profits above the previous forecast due to stable revenues based on long-term freight contracts, an accumulation of revenues from spot-base contracts, and the progression of the yen's depreciation.

Marine TransportationDemand Forecast Iron ore: The market for large vessels has recently been strengthening, and demand for steelmaking raw materials is expected to remain firm as Chinese steel demand will shift from the real estate sector to the infrastructure and manufacturing sectors. It is expected the Brazilian shipment base remain firm, transport ton-miles will increase and supply-demand balance will tighten. Coal: In China, imports of coal are expected to increase due to replacement demand for thermal power generation as hydroelectric power generation is significantly reduced due to the drought. Grains: Corn production and shipments in Brazil are expected to increase significantly due to favorable weather. Other cargoes are also generally increase, mainly grain transport from South America to China, supporting the market for small and mid-sized bulk carriers. Minor Bulk: China's bauxite imports will increase, and imports will shift from Indonesia to Guinea. Longer transport distances are expected as the country enters the dry season from November. Forecast for dry bulk vessel supply Although new-building dry bulk vessel deliveries are gradually recovering, they remain at historically low levels due to the impact of environmental regulations and the search for next-generation fuels, in addition to high ship prices associated with surging raw material prices. The pace of scrapping has picked up slightly, and if older vessels are scrapped, this will have a positive impact on the supply-demand condition. The impact on the market will be closely monitored, as delays in the Panama Canal passage due to drought conditions have increased.

The work ispublishedin the journalWater.The study is the first to look at the compounding effects of climate change and land use and land cover changes on the natural processes that replenish the Schuylkill watershed. The reductions in streamflow and groundwater stores could equate to drought-like conditions where there will not be enough water to meet the region's water demand for drinking, irrigation, transportation, energy generation, recreation, and sustaining aquatic ecosystems, according to the researchers.""The gap between available water and demand is expected to require difficult tradeoffs,"" said Mira Olson, Ph.D., an associate professor in the College of Engineering and principal investigator of the study. ""Our current resource management practices do not account for increases in the number of extreme precipitation events coupled withpopulation growthand a related shift in land cover that will result in more runoff—rather than water retention.""Using a mathematical modeling environment programmed to simulate streamflow based on current watershed management policies, the research team, which included Patrick Gurian, Ph.D., a professor in the College of Engineering, and former students Achira Amur, Ph.D., now a post-doctoral researcher at Villanova University, Suna Ekin Kali a doctoral student at Luleå University in Sweden and Lena Champlin, Ph.D., a post-doctoral researcher at Boston University, pulled in soil and land cover data from the U.S. Geological Survey and regional precipitation models from the World Climate Research Program to make its projections.After successfully recreating the hydrological dynamics of the Schuylkill watershed in the modeling environment, the team could then change various inputs—from greenhouse gas emission scenarios to population growth in cities and suburbs and their resulting land use changes—to simulate the effects of future climate conditions on the area's water supply.Perhaps counterintuitively, the variable that caused the largest increase in projected water shortfalls was an increase in extreme precipitation events. The researchers explained this is because the soil and land cover within the watershed limit how quickly water can be absorbed and how much can be stored at one time. So, while steady rain over a long period of time can replenish a watershed, downpours result in water runoff that is not captured and stored.Unfortunately, such an uptick in extreme weather events coupled with less precipitation overall during warm seasons, is precisely what climate data, localized from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is projecting for the Philadelphia region from 2020 to 2040.What this all means is that water management authorities may need to adjust the policies that govern when and how much water is released from reservoirs to satisfy downstream demand in the watershed area.""Watershed management requires maintaining a careful balance between the amount of water stored in the ground and natural bodies of water and the amount intentionally retained and released from reservoirs to make up for extended dry stretches in the hydrological cycle. All of these are subject to substantial uncertainties,"" Gurian said. ""For this reason, we considered multiple climate models, emissions levels, and development scenarios.""These stretches, the authors note, could result in more frequent low-flow conditions in streams and bodies of water which, coupled with higher temperatures, would result in more evaporation, further exacerbating the problem and requiring management interventions.""Our current management policies are based on the historical precipitation patterns we've experienced over the last 100 years or so, but in just a couple decades that weather is going to be very different and it's going to require a rebalancing of the system,"" Champlin said.The results of the study are similar to projections made and conditions already being experienced across North America, including the effects of development and extended drought conditions causing dangerously low levels in reservoirs that serve much of southern California, Nevada and Arizona. While the effect on Philadelphia may not be as dire, the authors suggest that their study represents enough of a warning to justify taking a closer look at the region's water management strategy.""This finding and this type of modeling is increasingly important as we're seeing watershed crises unfold in real time across the country,"" Amur said. ""While climate change is a problem that needs to be addressed on a global scale, understanding its future impacts at a regional level gives us the opportunity to make preparations that could mitigate some of these water shortages and other challenges associated withclimate change.""The next steps for this research, the authors suggest, should involve modeling development that includes green infrastructure and incorporates more detailed data on futureclimateandland useprojections. They would also recommend improving future models to incorporate regional differences in population growth trends to provide a higher resolution picture of the future of the watershed.""Our findings provide a roadmap for what lies ahead,"" Kali said. ""To secure the Schuylkill Watershed's ecosystem services, we must not only adapt our practices but also advocate for collaborative efforts in system and policy adaptation for a more resilient and sustainable future.""","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'sweden']",gb,False,False

Getting less attention is that recent weather patterns have helped alleviate the distress.August was cooler than normal in the Las Vegas area and brought monsoon rains. Last summer, similar weather hit the region. As a result, Clark County can no longer be classified as suffering from drought. In fact, the entire state of Nevada has benefited from the relief.As of September, more than ""94% of the state is drought-free, which is the largest percentage of zero drought that we've seen in three and a half years. At the end of August last year, over 50% of the state was in D3-Extreme Drought."" This news comes from UNR's Nevada Today in a report by Klaire Rhodes of the Nevada state climate office and Thomas Albright, the interim state climatologist.The West overall has also seen improved conditions. While some parts of Colorado, Arizona, Oregon, Washington, Montana and New Mexico have seen patches of increased drought, the Great Basin ""is almost entirely drought-free, except for a stubborn area of central Utah,"" the authors note. Drought conditions have improved significantly in California, Utah, Wyoming and Idaho.California, in particular, has made huge strides. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, virtually the entire state was under severe drought in 2022. By August of this year, however, only a small area in Southern California was not drought-free. Golden State reservoirs were filled and, as Time magazine noted in August, ""the main challenge now for California is no longer about getting enough precipitation; it's about finding somewhere to store all that water, so farmers and urban-dwellers can use it in the likely dry spells to come.""As for the months to come, a map issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center shows Nevada and California are expected to remain out of drought into early 2024.None of this is to minimize the importance of long-term water conservation and planning. Lake Mead is over-allocated, and long stretches ofdroughtin the Southwest have further stressed the region's water supplies. While recent relief is certainly welcome, most climate analysts believe the persistent dry spells will potentially worsen in the arid region in coming decades. This makes it even more important for Colorado River basin states to reach an agreement on a sustainable path forward.For now, however, these improvements bring welcome news to Nevada and other states.2023 Las Vegas Review-Journal.

Climate change makes heavy rain more common, because a hotter atmosphere can hold more moisture.Fida Hussain/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption A man walks over his collapsed mud house after heavy monsoon rains in Pakistan in 2022. Climate change makes heavy rain more common, because a hotter atmosphere can hold more moisture. The world is facing more extreme weather that scientists say is fueled by human-driven climate change. The poorest countries have done the least to cause the problem, but they are being hit the hardest by more intense droughts and floods and storms. Yet as the threats from a warming planet grow, the United Nations says in a new report that less money is being sent to developing countries to help them adapt. Developing countries, which have less wealth than developed countries like the United States, were promised $100 billion a year from their richer neighbors to help pay for cutting climate pollution and coping with the impacts of rising temperatures. Developed countriesdidn't deliver on their pledge. In 2021, they actually gave poorer nations 15% less money for climate adaptation than they did the year before. That meant less money for things like flood defenses, drought-resistant crops and early warning systems to help people evacuate emergencies. The UN estimates the gap between how much money developing countries need to pay for adaptation projects, and the amount of public funding they're getting directly from wealthier countries and from institutions like the World Bank now stands at between $194 billion and $366 billion every year. Put another way, poorer countries need at least 10 times more money for climate adaptation than the $21.3 billion in public funding that they received in 2021. The longer that gap persists and countries are forced to put off investments that could help blunt the impact of climate change, the moredamage they're going to suffer. That reality led to the creation of a ""loss and damage"" fund at last year's annual UN climate negotiations, and the talks at COP28 later this year in the United Arab Emirates will focus on how to get the fund up and running. ""People do want to adapt, do see climate change coming, do know what to do — but there's no finance available to actually do it,"" says Pieter Pauw, a researcher at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands who was one of the authors of the UN report. ""So, we'll see things like we saw last year in Pakistan, where almost a third of the country was flooded,"" Pauw says, ""partly because people are not adapted to climate change."" The flooding in Pakistan last summerkilled at least 1,700 peopleand caused an estimated$14.9 billion in damage. Climate changemakes heavy rain more common, because a hotter atmosphere can hold more moisture. The UN released its report on climate funding days afteran international group of scientists saidcountries probably won't hit a target they set to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to average temperatures in the late 1800s. Beyond that point, scientists say it is more likely that the world will suffer catastrophic climate impacts, like mass extinctions and a significant rise in sea levels. Earth's average temperature over the past decade was about 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial temperatures. Global warming is ""hitting some of these developing countries already quite hard,"" says Paul Watkiss, a climate change consultant and another author of the UN funding report. ""By not providing adaptation finance, or countries not being able to put sufficient resources to do adaptation, it means it's impacting [their] development."" It isn't clear if the funding gap can be quickly filled. Developed countries previously said they wouldat least double their adaptation fundingto around $40 billion annually by 2025. That's still just a fraction of what developing nations need. While countries haveanother year to set new targets for climate finance, the UAE, which is hosting this year's UN climate summit, seems to be making the issue a priority, says Adrianna Hardaway, senior policy advisory for climate at Mercy Corps, a humanitarian group. ""I think that perhaps compared to previous years, we are seeing more attention dedicated to the fact that not only is there not enough climate finance, but that it's really not reaching the people and the places that it has to go most,"" Hardaway says. Researchers say companies have also shown more interest in helping to make poorer countries more resilient to climate change, in part to protect their own supply chains. Efforts are also underway to get more climate funding to developing countries by changing how institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund operate. ""We've done the least to cause this problem, but it's still us who stands to suffer the most,"" says Wanjira Mathai, managing director of Africa and global partnerships at the World Resources Institute. ""And so we have to put in place — quickly and swiftly — all of the adaptation strategies that we can and focus on making sure that we build resilience against the immediate danger of climate change.""","['pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'netherlands']",us,True,False

""Through the TD Ready Commitment, we are focused on supporting innovative community projects that help create equitable access to green spaces, while also providing invaluable social and economic benefits to communities and the people who live within them."" By funding New Acre Project, TD is supporting ALUS’ work to build a vibrant environment, preventing nature loss and planting trees and shrubs in rural Canadian communities. To date, TD has funded 665 acres of projects that have planted over 35,000 native trees and nearly 10,000 native shrubs, with more projects being added in 2023. These project acres are contributing to local biodiversity and providing valuable ecosystem services that deliver economic value for communities. In 2023, TD has supported 115 acres of naturalization projects in rural communities. Since 2018, TD’s support has contributed to projects in thirteen communities in the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. ALUS communities in these five provinces work with local farmers and ranchers to develop targeted, local, market-driven solutions to environmental management challenges on working agricultural properties. “In its fifth year, the collaboration with TD is as important for New Acre Project now as it was in 2018. Consistent support such as what TD offers means ALUS can continue to grow its stock of projects that sequester carbon, slow erosion and capture and store nutrients on the rural landscape,” says Katherine Balpataky, Senior Director of Corporate Partnerships at ALUS. ALUS’ New Acre Project is a market-leading offering with an innovative and valuable solution to the climate and biodiversity crises: a network of farmers and ranchers putting environmental projects in the ground. Farmers and ranchers continue to join their local ALUS communities, because the program empowers them as solution providers, giving them the necessary tools and resources to benefit the natural world for their communities and future generations.

Yes, that is possible, according to a study by Wageningen Economic Research, commissioned by the Sustainable Dairy Chain, a theme group of ZuivelNL.The costs directly related tomilkand feed production are 2.56 euros per 100 kg of milk lower at more sustainable dairy farms than at the rest. This is mainly due to the lower costs foranimal feed(-2.13 euros) and lower manure disposal costs (-0.25 euros). Both are related to lower milk production per hectare.The more sustainable dairy farms are on average more extensive and produce 150,000 kg less milk atfarmlevel than the rest group. Milk production per hectare at the more sustainable dairy farms averages almost 14,400 kg, while the remainder group is more than 3,000 kg above this. The costs foranimal healthare also lower (-0.14 euros). The total costs per 100 kg of milk are 1.68 euros lower at the more sustainable dairy farms, but that difference is not statistically significant.In addition to lower costs, the more sustainable dairy farms also have 3.30 euros higher returns per 100 kg of milk. About half of this difference is the result of higher milk price (+1.67 euros). This can be explained, among other things, by the financial valuation of environmental and/or other sustainability performance from the best performing group.The share of organic farms and farms with On the way to The PlanetProof quality mark is higher in the group of best-performing farms than in the rest of the farms. It is important to realize that other dairy farmers who would like to do so cannot always simply supply milk for such milk flows. Matters such as market demand and the location of the farm in the Netherlands can be decisive.The lower costs and higher yields per 100 kg of milk lead to an income at the more sustainable dairy farms, despite the smaller farm size, that is more than 28,500 euros higher at farm level than the rest group.Experience countsThe more sustainable dairy farms are more often run by farmers between the ages of 45 and 55 and less by entrepreneurs under the age of 45. A possible explanation for this is that younger livestock farmers have relatively less experience.Middle-aged dairy farmers have learned a lot from experience in the past. already learned their lessons in the past and have developed their craftsmanship accordingly. Another explanation may be that young entrepreneurs are more focused on growing and developing their farm and are less focused on optimization.Less peat soilThe more sustainabledairy farmshave 12% less peat soil than the rest of the farms and the most common soil type on the farm is often sand. In terms of provincial distribution, the more sustainable farms are mainly located in Overijssel, Friesland and Groningen, and are less represented than the rest of the companies in Gelderland, North Holland and Drenthe.This spread could partly be related to the drought in 2020. Drought may have had a negative impact on sustainability performance. The drought was more extreme in Gelderland and hardly played a role in the north of the country.Craftsmanship and entrepreneurship are importantCraftsmanship appears to help determine performance in the field of sustainability. These skills can be increased through knowledge exchange and/or the use of independent advisors or training.Entrepreneurship is also important, and it is characteristic of more sustainable dairy farmers that they stick to their own strategy that suits them and that they consistently maintain that line. Dairy farmers can be facilitated in determining the right strategy.Long-term goals of dairy processors can also helpdairy farmersto choose a strategy. These goals provide clarity about what is expected of a dairy farmer as a member or supplier of a dairy processor in the future.Being extensive is not the same as becoming extensiveThe research has been retrospective and the research therefore does not answer the question of how to achieve a different outcome. The more sustainable farms are more extensive and have a higher income in this study. This does not mean that extensification is economically feasible. Being extensive is not the same as becoming extensive.For example, farms with more extensive business operations may have been following a strategy for decades to maintain a certain balance in the ratio of land and animals as the farm grows. Given the current social context, these companies now have a better starting position.Other companies may have consciously opted for a more intensive farm system within the legislation that applied in the past, with relatively more investment in, for example, production rights (milk quota and later phosphate rights, functional barns and manure processing. It may be economically difficult or impossible for those farms to extensify now, for example because of the investments already made in the past.After all, expansion means more land and land is expensive and not always available. Or extensification means keeping fewer animals, so that not all capacity is used and the fixed costs per kg of milk increase.","['netherlands', 'netherlands', 'netherlands', 'germany']",gb,False,False

Consolidated cash costs improved to $14.13 per AgEq ounce and All-in sustaining costs (""AISC"") (see ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"", below) improved to $19.74 per AgEq ounce representing a reduction of 9% and 8%, respectively, compared to the previous quarter.

At the end of the quarter, the Company had a cash and restricted cash balance of $257.3 million consisting of $138.3 million cash and cash equivalents and $119.0 million of restricted cash.

OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS NM - Not meaningful(1) The Company reports non-GAAP measures which include cash costs per silver equivalent ounce produced, cash costs per gold ounce produced, all-in sustaining cost per silver equivalent ounce produced, all-in sustaining cost per gold ounce produced, total production cost per tonne, average realized silver price per silver equivalent ounce sold, average realized gold price per ounce sold, working capital, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. These measures are widely used in the mining industry as a benchmark for performance, but do not have a standardized meaning under the Company's financial reporting framework and the methods used by the Company to calculate such measures may differ from methods used by other companies with similar descriptions. See ""Non-GAAP Measures"" below for further details of these measures. Q3 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS The Company realized an average price of $22.41 per AgEq ounce during the third quarter of 2023, representing a 14% increase compared to the third quarter of 2022. Revenues generated during the quarter totalled $133.2 million, compared to $159.8 million in the third quarter of 2022. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to the temporary suspension of operations at Jerritt Canyon and slightly lower production at San Dimas and La Encantada. The Company reported mine operating earnings of $13.0 million compared to $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2022. The increase in mine operating earnings is primarily attributable to an improvement in cost of sales and depreciation and depletion compared to the prior year quarter, following the temporary suspension of mining operations at Jerritt Canyon in the first quarter of 2023. During the quarter, the Company incurred restructuring costs of $6.4 million as the Company continues to focus on optimizing its workforce primarily at San Dimas, as well as the Durango regional office and Santa Elena. The Company reported net loss of $27.1 million (EPS of ($0.09)) compared to net loss of $20.7 million (EPS of ($0.08)) in the third quarter of 2022. The net loss for the quarter was driven by the restructuring costs, additional mine holding costs primarily related to the temporary suspension of Jerritt Canyon, and $1.6 million one-time loss on sale of mining interest following the disposition of La Parrilla. Adjusted net earnings for the quarter, normalized for non-cash or non-recurring items such as share-based payments, unrealized losses on marketable securities and non-recurring write-downs on mineral inventory for the quarter was ($10.9) million (adjusted EPS of ($0.04)) compared to ($22.6) million (adjusted EPS of ($0.09)) in the third quarter of 2022. Operating cash flow before movements in working capital and taxes in the quarter $14.1 million compared to $27.7 million in the third quarter of 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had a cash and restricted cash balance of $257.3 million consisting of $138.3 million cash and cash equivalents and $119.0 million of restricted cash. The Company also had working capital of $197.8 million. OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS The table below represents the quarterly operating and cost parameters at each of the Company's four producing mines during the quarter. (1) Jerritt Canyon production during the third quarter comprised of pouring residual work-in- process inventory.(2) See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"", below for further details of these measures. Total production in the third quarter was 6.3 million AgEq ounces consisting of 2.5 million ounces of silver and 46,720 ounces of gold, representing a 7% decrease and 4% increase, respectively, compared to the previous quarter. The Company's Mexican operations produced over 2.5 million ounces of silver and 46,324 gold ounces, or approximately 6.3 million AgEq ounces in the quarter. Silver equivalent production for the Mexican operations increased 5% over the prior quarter primarily due to higher tonnes, grades and recoveries at Santa Elena. Cash cost for the quarter improved to $14.13 per AgEq ounce, compared to $15.58 per AgEq ounce in the previous quarter. The reduction in cash costs per ounce was primarily attributable to an increase in AgEq production at the Santa Elena operations. Production at Santa Elena increased by 49%, compared to the prior quarter, as a direct result of processing higher grade silver and gold ore from the Ermitaño underground mine. Record recoveries were also achieved due to the recent addition of the Dual Circuit plant. Additionally, the Company has implemented numerous costs saving measures to help offset the strengthening of the Mexican Peso and to combat inflationary impacts primarily in energy, reagents, and other major consumables. AISC in the third quarter was $19.74 per AgEq ounce compared to $21.52 per AgEq ounce in the previous quarter. The 8% improvement in AISC was primarily attributable to lower cash costs along with a reduction in general and administrative costs as the Company has reduced its headcount across various corporate and operational departments. Total capital expenditures in the third quarter were $32.2 million, primarily consisting of $13.5 million at San Dimas, $12.3 million at Santa Elena, $1.6 million at La Encantada, $2.8 million at Jerritt Canyon and $2.0 million for strategic projects. Q3 2023 DIVIDEND ANNOUNCEMENT The Company is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend payment in the amount of $0.0046 per common share for the third quarter of 2023. The third quarter cash dividend will be paid to holders of record of First Majestic's common shares as of the close of business on November 15, 2023, and will be distributed on or about November 30, 2023. Under the Company's dividend policy, the quarterly dividend per common share is targeted to equal approximately 1% of the Company's net quarterly revenues divided by the number of the Company's common shares outstanding on the record date. The amount and distribution dates of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors. This dividend qualifies as an ""eligible dividend"" for Canadian income tax purposes. Dividends paid to shareholders outside Canada (non-resident investors) may be subject to Canadian non-resident withholding taxes.

Therefore, he must have been pleased to leave with a draw. This point puts the Cottagers at the same point tally after 10 games as the previous season, despite letting go of their star striker Aleksandar Mitrovic.For Manchester United, it may be a relief to play away from home. On Sunday, they suffered a 3-0 loss to their neighbours. It was their fourth defeat in nine games at Old Trafford this season across all competitions.Erik ten Hag has however seen his side win back-to-back road trips, defeating the newly-promoted pair Burnley and Sheffield United. Hence, I am siding with the marginal favourite to be the winner here.Looking at the head-to-head stats, the Red Devils also have a formidable unbeaten record against Fulham, which stretches 17 games and includes three wins last season.Fulham vs Manchester United Bet 1:Manchester United to win @ 2.04 with Bet9jaCaptain to keep up fine record against hostsWhile there may have been calls to strip Bruno Fernandes of the Manchester United captaincy, he undoubtedly remains one of the better performers in the struggling side he leads. Only Marcus Rashford has had more goal attempts or more shots on target for the Red Devils than the Portuguese midfielder. Additionally, only Scott McTominay has scored more league goals.Last term, the 29-year-old contributed 14 goals and 15 assists in his 59 club games across all competitions. This included three goals against Fulham, which makes him a value addition to my tips.Related NewsTottenham vs Chelsea predictions and betting tips for the Premier LeagueLuton Town vs Liverpool Predictions: Reds firepower too hot too handle for the HattersBrentford vs West Ham Predictions: Betting Tips for the Premier LeagueIt is also assumed Fernandes will be on penalty duty, having scored the only spot kick given to his side this season.

The estimate is presented in an articlepublishedinFire.The area destroyed by that year's disastrous fires was far larger than had been thought, according to the article. Previous estimates ranged from 14,307 km² to 36,017 km². Led by scientists at the National Space Research Institute (INPE) in Brazil, the study included construction of a model based on satellite images from the European Space Agency's SENTINEL-2 satellite, which was shown to estimate regional-scale burned areas with significantly greater precision and accuracy than other satellite-based models for the Pantanal.The approach used in the study achieved 96% accuracy, and the results ""will help to improve estimates of trace gases and aerosols associated with biomass burning,"" the authors note, adding that ""global biomass burning inventories are widely known for having biases at a regional scale.""The findings highlight the need for approaches that better assess the influence of fire on ecosystems and biodiversity in regions critically sensitive to climate change, such as the Pantanal. Their importance is all the greater in light of the strength of this year's El Niño, which could make the northern portion of the Pantanal and adjacent areas in the Upper Paraguay Basin drier and more susceptible to fire.""The results of the study don't show one model or product to be better than another. Every method has its own strengths and limitations. Estimates tend to vary significantly as a result. However, the images furnished by the MSI [Multispectral Instrument] on board SENTINEL-2 have two positive points:spatial resolutionis 20 meters, providing much better detail of burned areas; and temporal resolution, very important to this type of study, is 5 days, compared with a revisit frequency of up to 16 days for the Landsats,"" said forest engineer Andeise Cerqueira Dutra, an author of the article and a Ph.D. candidate at INPE's Earth Observation and Geoinformatics Division (DIOTG), with Yosio Edemir Shimabukuro as thesis advisor.Shimabukoro is the penultimate author of the article. The last author is Guilherme Augusto Verola Mataveli, also a researcher at DIOTG-INPE.For Mataveli, it is important to refine this type of analysis and obtain regional-scale estimates in order not only to estimate burned areas more accurately but also to calculate greenhouse gas emissions, which directly affectclimate change.""The 2020 Pantanal fire crisis was caused by anextreme drought. Severe drought will tend to be increasingly frequent there and in other parts of Brazil. Knowing more about the impact of these extreme weather events on the biome and its biodiversity will be more and more important to decisions regarding fire management and fire mitigation programs,"" said Mataveli.""Finding ways to improve these products and generate moreaccurate datais very important for society. An example is the pilot project launched this year in the Pantanal, also using remote sensing data to identify areas affected by fire and estimate the accumulation of combustible matter. Managers of environmental agencies and firefighters can use these findings to manage fire in an integrated manner, defining priority areas and actions to combat or control fires,"" Dutra said.ConsequencesThe Pantanal is normally under water in the rainy season, which extends roughly between October and May, and is modulated by the South American Monsoon System (SAMS). The dry season usually begins in June or July. Fires in the region tend to peak in September. However, the pattern changed in 2019, which saw the onset of a prolonged drought that worsened in 2020, when annual precipitation in the Brazilian portion of the Pantanal was the lowest since the 1980s and 26% lower than the 1982–2020 average.As a result, the water surface area shrank 34% compared with the average, the aggregate burned area was 200% more than the long-term average, and 35% burned for the first time on record.The cost of restoration was estimated at USD 123 million. Researchers estimated that the 2020 wildfires killed some 16 millionsmall animals(under 2 kg) and 944,000 larger animals.The Jaguar (Panthera onca), the largest feline species in the Americas, wasespecially hard hit. The fires destroyed 45% of the estimated population of P. onca, or some 450 individuals (87% in Brazil), burning 79% of its home range area and 54% of protected areas within that range. Until then, the Pantanal was home to the second-largest population of jaguars in the world.Another consequence was a rise in the number of people hospitalized for treatment of respiratory problems in the states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, as shown by astudy(in Portuguese) conducted by Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), an arm of Brazil's Health Ministry.MethodologyThe researchers usedsatellite imagesfrom SENTINEL-2 to estimate burned areas in the Brazilian part of the Pantanal in 2020 and compared these with estimates based on MODIS (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensors aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites) and Landsat imaging. The former (MCD64A1 and Fire_cci) gave estimates of 35,837 km² and 36,017 km² respectively, while the latter (MapBiomas Fogo and GABAM) gave estimates of 23,372 km² and 14,307 km².The spatial distribution patterns in these maps were visually similar, but the estimates based on SENTINEL-2 imaging detected a larger number of smaller fires, especially in the eastern Pantanal. ""The model we developed is available to anyone interested, as is the data collected in the validation exercise. We believe they can help researchers engaged in future projects,"" Mataveli said.""Drought is set to be increasingly frequent, andfireepisodes therefore will tend to be more frequent as well, so we expect more collaborative research and a growing supply of data,"" Dutra said. ""We also expect more field data to be accessible, especially for scientists who work with remote sensing to produce more accurate output.""Between January 1 and August 23, 2023, 381 fires were detected in the Pantanal, according todatafrom INPE (in Portuguese). In the same period of 2020, there were 8,127, the highest number since 1998 for the biome. Forest fires have intensified this year in the context of heat waves in Europe and North America, leaving many deaths and ruined neighborhoods in their wake.","['brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'not found', 'russia']",gb,False,False

Unlike most others, Noort had a professional reason to follow the drama.An expert in Earth observation technology, he took part in a research project that used EU funding to set up a flood-alert system in another African country: Kenya.Early warningsNoort had that successful work in mind as he watched the impact of torrential rains in Libya that caused two dams to burst, inundate the coastal city of Derna, destroy entire neighborhoods and kill thousands of people. Survivors have said they received no adequate alert.""Putting an early-warning system in place could have warned people and the number of casualties would have been far lower,"" said Noort, a Dutch native who is an independent consultant on geospatial information applications. ""Although it was a flash flood, it still takes some time to get to the urban area.""The EU project—calledTWIGA—established such an early-warning system with the Kenya Meteorological Department in Narok, a town located in the southwestern part of the country near the capital Nairobi. The initiative wrapped up in July 2022 after more than four years.Narok regularly gets inundated in part because it is located in a basin known as the Great Rift Valley, with a flash flood inFebruary 2022resulting in two deaths and widespread destruction.The alert system relies onsatellite dataand official weather forecasts combined with additional—but relatively inexpensive—weather stations and water-flow measurements of rivers.Residents can subscribe to phone alerts. The system is now being improved in a follow-up project—TEMBO Africa—that started in February 2023 and will include monitoring of smaller rivers.""If you get five or even just two hours of warning, that is valuable,"" said Nick van de Giesen, who ran TWIGA, now leads TEMBO and is a professor of water-resource management at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. ""We are generating information that can be turned into actions.""Flood prediction allows people to move to safety, relocate animals and vehicles and block latrines.Dam flowsMore places in Africa are becoming vulnerable to floods as a result of climate change and urbanization, which has increased the amount of hard surfaces that prevent water absorption by the ground. Inadequate drainage also often plays a role.""The idea now is to roll out aflood-predictionservice throughout Kenya and after that to find partners in other African countries to do the same,"" said Noort.Another part of TWIGA tackled water levels behind dams. It deployed technology for monitoring inflows into reservoirs for hydropower plants in Ghana and Zambia.Water can sometimes reach such heights that dam operators are forced to spill it through sluice gates to drain a reservoir. This can cause flooding downstream. It also wastes potential hydroelectricity.Better management of reservoirs by measuring rainfall and river flow upstream was shown in TWIGA to be a game changer. Knowing how much water is coming allows dam operators to act before an emergency release becomes necessary.""Maybe you could more gradually spill water or—ideally—generate extra electricity by letting the water run through your turbines,"" said van de Giesen.Scientists are working with local partners in Ghana and Zambia to create easy-to-use technology. This should prevent deluges in towns and villages downstream of hydropower dams.""It is better to spill than have the dams washed away, like what happened in Libya,"" said van de Giesen, who has worked onwater projectsas an engineer in West Africa.Seed securitySeed insurance is also being trialed for farmers in Ghana, where asemi-arid climatecontributes to crop losses.Under a planned scheme, growers would pay a little extra when buying seeds in return for compensation in the event there isn't enough rain after they're sown.The key is to tell planters when to sow and know when there has been insufficient rain for germination.""If you have small farmers, with less than two hectares, you cannot send insurance agents to all,"" said van de Giesen.Satellites and rainfall detectors automatically signal when insufficient amounts have fallen.While satellites play a role high up, they are unable to scrutinize rainfall down on the ground for farms.Instead, project scientists have turned to cosmic rays for a helping hand.Fast payoutsSubatomic particles from space—called neutrons—zip around at speeds up to 20,000 kilometers a second on Earth. When there's plenty of rain, the particles bounce off water molecules, slowing them down.The researchers built a kit that can detect this neutron slowdown, which signals rainfall. The system combines this information with satellite images to improve predictions about when an individual farm faces drought.In a drought scenario, a farmer automatically receives seeds in compensation or a payout to buy more if needed.""A big innovation here is that we're going to be really fast with paying out,"" said van de Giesen.A Ghanaian insurance group plans to make the product available to local insurers and banks in 2024.""This is really about anchoring satellite observations to measurements on the ground,"" said van de Giesen.","['kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'ghana', 'ghana', 'ghana', 'ghana', 'zambia', 'zambia', 'zambia', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'netherlands', 'france']",gb,False,False

Only when you finally reach the Little Aral Sea, known as Kishi Aral, can you feel the coolness and breathe deeply. The fisherman are either napping or chatting about the intricacies of rural life as they rest after their morning catch. They are all residents of the tiny settlement of Shomishkol. Abilbay Abildaev, a 51-year-old father of 10 -- nine daughters and one son -- says he was able to provide for them thanks to fishing. ""Fishing is the trade of my ancestors. God willing, I won't give up this business either. It's difficult for a man over 50 to find another job,"" Abildaev said, looking at the ripple of the waters above the blue sea as it moves toward the shore. Abildaev's son did not want to become a fisherman, and his father understands. In recent years, water levels have dropped as the levels of salinity has increased. As a result, fish stocks are falling, much like the income of fishermen. ""When the water from the river stopped flowing into the sea, there were noticeably fewer fish. Our earnings dropped by 50-70 percent. The situation now is not very good. The sea needs water. When there is more water, the catch will increase. But now the situation is such that we can't justify the costs [of going out], and we instead linger in the parking lot. This spring, there were no fish at all,"" Abildaev says. Many fishermen live nearby for 10-15 days at a time, bringing with them fishing equipment, fuel for their boats, and food. Lately, they've had to rely on loans to finance their costs. Only when there is a catch can they pay off their debts and have something left over for their families. On a good day, a fisherman can haul in 20-30 kilograms of fish. The catch is divided equally between the two fishermen who work each boat. Afterward, the fresh fish are sold and taken to a fish factory. Demand Sets The Price ""I've been fishing since the construction of the [Dike Kokaral Dam] in 2005. At first, because the seawater was salty, all of the fish were found at the mouth of the river where we fished. As the volume of water increased there were more fish. In the last two to three years, the sea stopped receiving the river's water, and there were no fish again. Previously, fishermen could catch 100 kilograms of fish a day; now they are happy with 20-30 kilograms. Sometimes we come back empty-handed,"" said another fisherman, Mukangazy Ibaev. In the afternoon, the fishermen began to prepare for the next trip. They load the nets onto an old motorcycle that will be driven close to the water's edge. Getting to the water with the nets is a challenge in and of itself. Over the course of the past year, the sea has moved away from the coast by about 1 1/2 kilometers. Ibaev's assistant, Askhat, loads a large net onto the boat. According to fishing tradition, they shout ""Maylansyn!"" or ""Big catch!"" as the fishermen answer loudly, ""Let it be so!"" After launching the boat, the fishermen have to push it another 500-600 meters to get past the shallow water. ""We walked about 1 1/2 to two kilometers from the shore. But we are still dragging the propeller. It's too shallow here; there's only half a meter of water. We'll drop the nets somewhere in the 20-30 kilometer range. Then we will return in the evening. During this time, we will burn 50 liters of fuel with our little motor. There are times when we return empty-handed and cannot reimburse the cost of fuel,"" Ibaev said. Livelihoods Tied To The Sea Due to the receding waters, more and more people are leaving fishing to pursue work in other industries -- even leaving for other regions. This is confirmed by the many abandoned boats along the shore. ""Fishermen work on a rotating basis. In the summer, they must work in construction. These are all their boats. Who will buy these boats? Nobody! Everyone here is a fisherman. On the one hand, they probably don't want to lose hope that the sea will return or that the water will come back. Everything ultimately comes down to water. If water came, the situation would improve. In previous years, there was a lot of water in the dam, and all of the boats were on the water. People worked and lived well,"" said Zhetkergen Akmyrzaev, a local businessman in the fishing industry. For those living nearby, their communities are closely connected with fishing. One of them is the village of Karashalan, located at the mouth of the Syr-Darya River (also known as the Jaxartes), 170 kilometers from the city of Aralsk. In Karashalan, there are still houses that locals call ""tokal tam,"" built of reeds and without roofs, whose outsides are decorated with clay. ""Fishermen used to live in such houses. Later, when the Kokaral Dam was built and the water flowed into the sea, life in the fishing villages began to improve,"" a local resident explained. A large house in a traditional Kazakh village is an indicator of a good life, and there are many of them in Karashalan. There are also those who built cottages in remote villages. Fishing and cattle breeding have been practiced here for a long time. But the sea is closer to those who live here -- it is the source of livelihoods. ""No water has flowed into the sea since March. We have 124 families living here and everyone is worried. There are between 70 and 80 fishermen in our village. The well-being of their families is connected with the sea,"" said Orazbay Ospanov, a Karashalan resident. Irreparable Damage Zaualkhan Ermakhanov, a local ichthyologist, is concerned that the Little Aral Sea could become a dead sea. After all, the salinity has increased as the flow of water from the Syr Darya has decreased. Currently, the amount of salt per liter of seawater is 13 grams. If the salinity of the water exceeds 16 grams, the fish in the sea will die off. ""The native fish of the Aral spawned at an average water salinity of 10 grams. If a liter of seawater contains more than 10 grams of salt, it will be difficult for fish to spawn. Even if they do spawn, the eggs will die. We've been noticing this lately. The salinity of seawater is now 13 grams. That's why the fishermen are worried,"" Ermakhanov said. ""Without additional water from the Syr Darya River flowing into the Little Aral Sea, the fish will not survive,"" he adds. Experts warn that if the problem of the Little Aral Sea is not urgently tackled it will cause irreparable damage to nature and humanity. ""Previously, before the construction of the Kokaral Dam, the salinity of the Little Aral was 35 grams. That is, it was the same as the salinity of the ocean. In those difficult years, there were no fish. If urgent measures are not taken at the top, the Little Aral will cease to be a breadwinner,"" Ermakhanov said. According to official data, out of 12 cubic kilometers of water annually entering the Kyzylorda region, only three cubic kilometers flow into the Little Aral Sea. Ermakhanov doubts the water volume indicated in the data actually flows into the sea. According to Ermakhanov, Kazakhstan doesn't use its river water efficiently. According to his calculations, the Little Aral Sea will return to its previous state in five to six years if it receives at least six cubic kilometers of water per year. ""On the banks of the Syr Darya is the Koksarai Dam. Its goal is to collect water and send it to the Kyzylorda region in the summer. If you look now, there is water in Koksarai and the fish are thriving. They shouldn't be. The water should be directed downward. The purpose of the Syr Darya watershed isn't intended for fisheries -- it should be directed to the Little Aral Sea. This is one of the ways to save it, Ermakhanov said. Water levels in the Aral Sea have been falling rapidly since the 1960s. This is due to several coastal states irrigating fields from the two main rivers flowing into the Aral Sea, the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, which have led to environmental disasters. Eventually, the sea split into four lakes: the Little Aral (the North Aral Sea), the eastern and western basins of the once far larger South Aral Sea, and the smaller Barsakelmes Lake. By 2009, the southeastern lake had disappeared and the southwestern lake had retreated to a thin strip at the western edge. Now there is no Aral Sea; it is a dead sea. Experts are concerned that the Little Aral could be next. ""To prevent a catastrophe, it is necessary to increase the volume of water flowing from the river to the sea. The Syr Darya is a river whose water is used by four countries, whose populations and needs for water are increasing every year,"" says Ainagul Baimakhanova, director of the Aral Tenizi public association. ""As far as we know, at least 50 percent of the river water entering the Kyzylorda region does not reach the sea. The reason is wastefulness,"" she adds. ""Few of us pay enough attention to water, count it, or care about where our water goes. For example, water meters have been installed in Uzbekistan. The waterways are completely monitored. There is no wastefulness allowed there. But this is not the case with us [in Kazakhstan]."" ""Due to poor monitoring, less and less water reaches the Little Aral, and the sea becomes shallower every year."" The first studies related to marine restoration on the Aral Sea began in 1975-1976. During this period, scientific research was carried out on ""restoration of the mouths of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers, restoration of the Little Aral Sea."" It was decided to build two dams. Kazakhstan completed construction of the first of the two dams, Kokaral, in 2005. More than 18 years have passed and the second stage of saving the Aral Sea was proposed by never implemented. According to experts, over the past five years the sea level has dropped by 2 1/2 meters. Once the volume of the Little Aral was 27 cubic kilometers but now 10 cubic kilometers are gone. That is, more than one-third of the water has disappeared. Politicizing Water Scarcity On September 15, a meeting of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea was held in Tajikistan. The issue of restoring the disappearing sea and ensuring that rivers continue to flow into it was discussed. Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoev, who took part in the meeting, expressed his concern that the Kushtepa canal being built in Afghanistan will lead to a further decrease in the water volume flowing into the Amu Darya. Mirziyoev proposed holding discussions with the Taliban. Kazakh President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev also drew attention to the condition of the two main rivers flowing into the Aral Sea and the problem of the inefficient use of water. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the creation of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea, whose members are Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. The presidents of those countries hold a summit every three years, though there's no mention of how much money has been allocated to the fund or where and how it is spent. Previously, experts agreed that the funds were not enough to solve water shortages and environmental problems in the region. Botha Sharipova, an associate at the Institute of Water Sciences in Delft, the Netherlands, and a consultant on transboundary water cooperation and diplomacy, says issues of water scarcity in Central Asia are becoming more complex and politicized every year. ""It's a paradox, but in order to avoid disputes and conflicts, government officials did not fully discuss water issues with experts, but only left them on paper at a high political level, further complicating the problem,"" Sharipova explains. ""The international fund still cannot agree on the location where the executive committee, its main body, will be located. Therefore, every three to four years a new institution opens in the next country. It is planned to open in Kazakhstan in January next year. And the member states of this fund do not allocate money for the fund's projects. They implement projects only on their own land and say this is their contribution to the fund."" Sharipova says people had high hopes for the creation of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea, but it's doubtful whether it can function effectively in its current state. ""Although there is support at the highest political level from all states, water experts and other experts do not sit down and discuss how to allocate water effectively,"" she says. ""Water and energy can become the only unifying factor in the region if water, energy, environmental, and economic experts from all countries come together to find a solution. Sharipova says it's unlikely the states will listen to one another and that each is only looking out for its own interests and not those of the region. ""Climate change is causing both floods and droughts. Dialogue and cooperation on water resources require constant negotiations,"" she adds. For the fishermen who depend on the water for their livelihoods, the foot-dragging by politicians may come too late to salvage what's left of the Little Aral Sea.

Some children, like 10-year-old Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim, are already on the move. Her family left their home in Somalia after dawn prayers on a Saturday morning five months ago. The worst drought in more than 50 years scorched the once-fertile pastures the family relied on, leaving them barren. So, bundling only a few clothes and some utensils into sacks, they moved to a camp in the capital Mogadishu, where Ibrahim, who dreams of being a doctor, is now going to school for the first time. That’s a plus, but the camp lacks proper shelter and sanitation, and food is scarce. “We need something that can protect us from the heat during the day and the cold at night,” Ibrahim said. The miseries of long, drawn-out disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report — more than half of them in Somalia — but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no pre-emptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide, climate change has already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines; storms are battering megacities and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. “The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in (the) future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify,” said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the report's authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 2016-21 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. Floods displaced children more than 19 million times in places like India and China. Wildfires impacted children 810,000 times in the U.S. and Canada. Data tracking migrations because of weather extremes typically don't differentiate between children and adults. UNICEF worked with a Geneva-based nonprofit, the International Displacement Monitoring Center, to map where kids were most impacted. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. Those countries also have vast populations and strong systems to evacuate people, which makes it easier for them to record data. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring “overlapping crises” — where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. During unprecedented flooding of the Yamuna River in July in the Indian capital New Delhi, churning waters washed away the hut that was home to 10-year-old Garima Kumar’s family. The waters also took her school uniform and her school books. Kumar lived with her family on sidewalks of the megacity and missed a month of school. “Other students in the school teased me because my house had been flooded. Because we don’t have a permanent home,” Kumar said. The floodwaters have receded and the family began repairing their home last month — a process Garima’s mother Meera Devi said they are having to do over and over again as floods are becoming more common. Her father, Shiv Kumar, hasn’t had any work for over a month. The family's only income is the mother’s $2 daily earnings as a domestic helper. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnam-based expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasn’t involved with the report. “When you’re desperate, you do things that you normally wouldn’t do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they don’t have the ability to stand up for themselves,” she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become “shock-responsive, portable and inclusive,” to help children and their families better cope with disasters. This would mean considering children’s needs at different stages, from ensuring they have opportunities to study, that they can stay with their families and that eventually they can find work. “We have the tools. We have the knowledge. But we’re just not working fast enough,” Healy said. ___ Ghosal reported from Hanoi, Vietnam, Fassett reported from Seattle.

Anew studyin Nature from researchers at the Global Change Research Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences shows that the rise in temperatures in Europe has caused a decline in the production of hops. This is important for thebeer industrybecause the ever-popular India Pale Ales (IPAs)and their related off-shoots depend on aroma hops for their unique scents and bitter taste. Beer makers were already facingincreased costsfrom things like transportation, electricity, labor, and other ingredients. Add in this drop in hops supply, combined with itsgrowing demandfor hops in the beer industry and therise in microbreweries, the hops' cost will increase and, subsequently, the beer's price for the consumers. The alternative is for breweries to turn toa lower-quality hop. However, the high-quality hopsneeded for IPAsto achieve their desired bitterness and aromas are already more expensive, so these beers are typicallymore costlythan traditional styles.According to Untappd, a social network and guide for beer enthusiasts, the average 16-ounce draft for the average American IPA is $6.88 compared to $4.94 for the average light beer. Using data since 1970, the researchers looked at how hop production has changed in Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia as temperatures have increased. The researchers reported that these areas are home to 90% of the world's hop-growing regions. According to their models, hop yield will decrease between 4 and18% by 2050. This decline in production is linked to hops ripening approximately 20 days earlier, causing a decrease in harvest by as much as 19.4%, depending on the specific area observed. The chemical makeup of the hops is also being impacted by a declining level of alpha acid, which gives the hops a bitter taste. The model projects a 20 to 31% drop in alpha acid content by 2050, further impacting the quality. The aroma hops are harvested once a year and most often in small areas of Europe withspecific environmental conditions. This specificity in habitat makes hopsmore susceptible to the climate crisisthan crops grown in areas with morevariable conditions. As the climate changes, areas that were once home to hops production become less hospitable, but new areas could open up. As the study's authors noted, many hop farmers have already been forced to adapt by moving crops tohigher elevations. The downside to this potential solution is the ideal lands may already be used for other purposes and available space could be limited. And even then, there might not be enough land. The authors concluded that to compensate for the loss of harvest and alpha acid content, the area used to grow aroma hops must expand by 20% compared to the current production area. Farmers have also combatted rising temperatures and droughts bybuilding irrigation systems, changingthe orientation and spacing of rows, or even switching tomore resistant varieties. The good news for American breweries is that the production of hops in the US is on the rise. Once restricted toYakima Valley, a small area in eastern Washington, hop farms are starting to pop up in other areas, like theEast Coast. The authors concluded by calling on ""urgent adaptation measures to stabilize international market chains,"" noting that these changes ""will affect the economics and prospects"" for European hop production. In other words, changes are needed to keep prices from going up. But until high temperatures and droughts slow and high-quality hops become more abundant, that IPA will cost more in the near future.","['not found', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'germany', 'czechia', 'slovenia', 'us']",us,True,True

And, perhaps most alarmingly for the IPA lovers of the world, they are starting to lose their critical bitter component. It’s going to get worse, researchers say. Hop yields could decline by as much as 18% by 2050, and their alpha acid content – which makes beer bitter – could decrease by up to 31% due to hotter and drier conditions, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. The findings add toa growing list of thingstheclimate crisis threatensyet people take for granted, said Miroslav Trnka, co-author of the study and researcher at the Global Change Research Institute. “One of the side motives of this study was to illustrate how climate change might be important for even those who think it doesn’t matter,” Trnka told CNN. “We are really seeing changes that are affecting things that we value, like the taste of beer. Climate change really can have an effect on it, or at least have an effect on commodities that are critical for production.” Coffee is in danger. Starbucks is working on solutions Beer brewing has been around since at least 3100 BC, the study notes. Now, each of the basic ingredients of today’s beer — water, barley, yeast and hops – are threatened by global warming. “With climate change affecting a vast number of agricultural crops, I’m not surprised,” said Douglass Miller, a senior lecturer in food and beverage management at Cornell University who is not involved in the study. “Hops are also finicky plants and there might be some crop failures,” Miller said, which could lead brewers to work with different flavor profiles from other types of hops. Researchers used weather data and climate models to analyze how European hops have been and will be affected by climate change between 1970 and 2050, assuming precipitation decreases and temperature increases. Scorching temperatureshave already shifted the start of hop growing season by 13 days from 1970 to 2018, according to the study. The growth of new shoots from the hop plant typically occurs during the spring, but since 1995, the researchers found it’s happening earlier in the regions analyzed than years prior. This early onset triggers earlier harvests, which could make it more difficult for hop growers to schedule harvesting and processing operations. In recent years, more consumers are preferring beer aromas and flavors that require higher-quality hops, according to the study. Since these hops are only grown in smaller regions, researchers say they’re put at even higher risk from climate change-fueled heat waves and droughts. “Hop farmers have changed the locations of hop fields in response to changes in temperature and precipitation and that is likely to continue,” said Mark Sorrells, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Integrative Plant Science who is not involved with the study. Why the climate crisis may be coming for your margarita next And while craft brews with aroma hops may be popular now, consumer preferences could change as growers adapt, Sorrells added. While this study only focused on major hop-growing European countries – which cover nearly 90% of the total area of aromatic hop fields in the continent – Trnka said it’s also representative of what could happen in beer-producing regions in the US such as the Pacific Northwest, where record-shattering heatwaves are occurring more often than usual. “They are facing similar problems like European (countries), perhaps a slightly different timing and different frequency but climate change is cumulatively affecting both regions in very similar ways,” Trnka said. Beer remains one of the world’s most widely consumed beverages. Even in a hotter future, people will still find ways to brew it, Trnka said – but it may not taste the same.","['germany', 'czechrepublic', 'slovenia', 'us']",us,True,False

Companies in the pulp and paper sector say they are adopting new technologies to reduce the amount of water they need, but as our climate changes, are they moving fast enough? One of the world's largest pulp mills recently began operations in Uruguay, the UPM Paso de Los Toros facility in the centre of the country. This came just as the nation was suffering its worst ever drought, sparking debate about its water use. Uruguay's capital, Montevideo, even ran out of fresh drinking water this year, after record low levels of rainfall. For several months, the authorities had to take supplies from a river estuary where sea water mixes with fresh water, making tap water slightly salty. Protestors, banging empty plastic bottles, came out on the streets, complaining that wood-pulping mills, and the forestry sector that supplies them, were using huge quantities of water. ""It's true that there's been a drought, but this crisis is caused by our economic model,"" said Isabel Figari, one of the protestors. ""Today, pulp mills have water, and we the people don't."" Uruguay's pulp mills turn eucalyptus and pine wood into cellulose, which is then exported to be made into paper abroad. The new facility in Paso de los Toros is run by Finnish company UPM. When working at full capacity it will produce 2.1 million tonnes of cellulose per year, doubling Uruguay's total output. This should see the country move from the world's 12th to 11th largest producer, overtaking Chile. The US is by far the biggest producer, followed by Brazil. In UPM's new mill the wood is chipped, then boiled with sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphide at high pressure. This dissolves the lignin in the wood leaving cellulose fibres. The cellulose is then bleached using chlorine dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. The process needs a lot of water. The mill takes 129 million litres of water a day from the local river, the Rio Negro. The waste water is then treated and pumped back into the river. UPM runs another pulp mill, Fray Bentos, in south-west Uruguay. The company points out that both its facilities are several hundred kilometres from Montevideo, in areas where there is no water scarcity, so cannot be responsible for water shortages in the capital. To reduce the amount of water it uses, the firm says it is applying the latest recycling technology. For example, when the wood chips are boiled in the Paso de Los Toros mill, the water vapour is condensed and used again. After the cellulose is pulped, the water is extracted and then used in the subsequent bleaching process. Overall, the water is recycled 100 times before it is treated and is discharged into river. ""This is an area of continuous work and development,"" says Marcos Battegazzore, vice president of UPM's operations in Uruguay. ""We have reduced the amount of water we take from the Uruguay River at Fray Bentos by almost 25%, and have also incorporated these water-saving technologies into our new plant in Paso de Los Toros. ""As technology develops there will be more possibilities to improve recycling levels within mills."" New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. Environmentalists in Uruguay are, however, not just concerned about the water usage of the pulp mills. They are also fearful that the waste water, despite it being treated, could still pollute rivers. Dr Diana Míguez is a senior scientist at Latitud, a Uruguayan research group. Her doctorate degree considered whether effluent from the Fray Bentos mill affected the hormones of fish in the adjacent Uruguay River. She found that when minnows, reared in her laboratory, were exposed to pulp mill effluent they produced half the number of eggs, as the control group. Her team also surveyed 1,000 native fish taken from the Uruguay River, and found that male fish caught downstream from the pulp mill had smaller testes. UPM's Mr Battegazzore says the company has ""a very, very strict monitoring plan that includes the follow up of the biota in the river on annual basis and which involves local and international scientists"". He adds: ""This is the standard way of monitoring, and it began two years before the mill was in operation, so it's a very reliable baseline. All this monitoring has revealed that there has been no change in the fish population in the river basin."" UPM adds that the emissions of its Fray Bentos facility follow the European Commission's ""best available techniques"" standards. Meanwhile, at the new Paso de Los Toros plant, the results of the water monitoring are uploaded in real time to the website of the Uruguayan environmental authorities for the public to see. But concerns about pollution have risen after sodium hydroxide leaked from the Paso de los Toros plant in August. Dead fish and plants were found in a nearby stream and lagoon, according to Uruguayan environment ministry inspectors. UPM says that they detected the substance in a field bordering the site, and took immediate corrective measures and informed the environmental authorities. But it's not just the water use of the mills that's under scrutiny. More than 1.2 million hectares of Uruguay have been planted with eucalyptus or pine trees for turning into paper pulp. Juan de Andrés is has a small cattle farm in the Cerro Largo department in the east of Uruguay. He thinks the densely-planted eucalyptus plantations, which suck up a lot of water from the soil, are drying out his nearby land. ""When I was growing up we took water from a well,"" he says. ""We'd take 300 or 400 litres every day. Now I don't think we can get 400 litres a week. With so many plantations, there's an incredible competition for water."" Uruguay's industry minister, Omar Paganini, says there is no evidence after 30 years of eucalyptus plantations that they are reducing water levels in the country. Unlike some parts of the world, where eucalyptus plantations replace natural forests, in Uruguay they are grown on grasslands. Most experts in Uruguay - including UPM - agree that eucalyptus plantations do use more water than natural grasslands. The key factor is whether there is enough rain to replenish local water sources. Daniel Panario is the director of the Environmental Science and Ecology Institute at Uruguay's University of the Republic. He says in the rainy sub-tropical north of Uruguay, tree plantations do not reduce local water levels, but in the rest of the country, where there is less rain, they often do. But wherever they are located, he says, monocultures degrade the soil and reduce biodiversity. ""Eucalyptus and pines generate irreversible changes in the physical chemical properties of the soil. The soil becomes acidic very quickly,"" he says.","['uruguay', 'uruguay', 'uruguay', 'uruguay', 'uruguay', 'uruguay', 'uruguay', 'uruguay', 'uruguay', 'uruguay', 'uruguay', 'uruguay', 'uruguay', 'dominicanrepublic', 'chile', 'chile', 'us', 'brazil']",gb,False,False

Concurrently, global warming is also producing the opposite effect in other instances, as a mega-drought threatened the water supply of Cape Town in southwestern Africa to the point where residents were at risk of running out of water. This one-two punch of weather extremes are devastating habitats, ecosystems, and human infrastructure.A team of paleoclimatologists from Syracuse University, George Mason University, and the University of Connecticut are studying an ancient source to determine future rainfall and drought patterns: fossilized plants that lived on Earth millions of years ago.In astudypublished inGeophysical Research Lettersled by Claire Rubbelke, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Earth and Environmental sciences at Syracuse, and Tripti Bhattacharya, Thonis Family Professor of Earth and Environmental sciences at Syracuse, researchers zeroed in on the Pliocene epoch (~3 million years ago)—a time when conditions were very similar to today.Despitewarmer temperatures, many parts of the world, including southwestern Africa, experienced dramatic increases in rainfall over land, likely caused by warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures. This mimics a modern event called a Benguela Niño, where researchers believe shifting winds cause warm waters to move southward along the coast of Africa causing enhanced rainfall over typically arid regions.""In the present day, the intensity and location of extreme precipitation from Benguela Niño events appear to be influenced by both Atlantic and Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures,"" says Rubbelke, who is a member of Bhattacharya's Paleoclimate Dynamics Lab.

""Looking into the future, how this sea surface temperature pattern may evolve has profound implications to the environmental changes in South Africa.""The team's work was inspired by collaborator and study co-author Natalie Burls, associate professor in the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Earth Sciences at George Mason University and an oceanographer and climate scientist from South Africa who received a Ph.D. at the University of Cape Town.""This study, which explored how past warm climates can inform us on what to expect in the future as our planet warms, brings to the fore the important role of ocean warming patterns,"" says Burls. ""It's important to understand how these patterns determine the response of the hydrological cycle over Southwest Africa to global warming.""To study the impact of climate warming on precipitation from millions of years in the past, the team analyzed ""molecular fossils"" in the form of ancient leaf waxes. ""These are compounds produced by leaves to protect themselves from drying out,"" says Bhattacharya. ""They get shed from leaf surfaces and find their way to ocean sediments, where we can extract them and study their chemical composition.""Plants use hydrogen from rainwater to produce the waxy outer coating on their leaves, which survives in ocean sediment for millions of years. The leaf wax functions as a time capsule preserved in ocean sediment.After transporting the millions-year-old sediment from Africa to their lab in Syracuse, Rubbelke and Bhattacharya used heat and pressure to extract lipids (e.g.,fat molecules), and then used a variety of solvents to isolate the exact class of molecules that they were looking to measure. From those molecules, they determined the number of different types of hydrogen present.By comparing their data to climate models, they verify how well those models capture past climate change, which can in turn improve the accuracy of those models to predict future rainfall. As Bhattacharya notes, this is critical because climate models often disagree on whether certain regions will get wetter or drier in response toglobal warming.""We are using real world data from the ancient geologic past to improve our ability to model rainfall changes as the planet warms,"" she says.As to whether the future will be wetter or drier in southwestern Africa, the team's results suggest that both are possible, depending on where extreme sea surface temperatures are occurring.While not much can be done to reverseclimate warming, the researchers say this study illuminates the need for vulnerable communities to have the tools and resources to adapt to these seemingly more frequent extreme weather events.","['southafrica', 'southafrica', 'southafrica', 'southafrica', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'czechia']",gb,False,False

This data improved the accuracy of the model's results by an order of magnitude, compared with uniform distributions of spores used in early versions.The researchers found that sub-Saharan Africa was a source for 53% of all viable spores and 14% of viable spores that traveled across the Atlantic.""This is the region that should likely be targeted for addressing the disease,"" Gold said.The researchers note that the study is preliminary, with future work focused on gatheringobservational datafor corroborating the model's results—including creating remote sensing maps of dust storms and genomic comparisons of F. oxy betweendustsources and areas of disease outbreaks.","['spain', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'mexico', 'haiti', 'cuba', 'philippines', 'ghana']",gb,False,False

Hazards in one region can have negative repercussions in another. These are known as transboundary climate risks, and they're a growing concern. They require coordinated, multinational responses, which can be a challenge given the different priorities and capabilities of each country.A transboundaryclimaterisk could be due to a shared ecosystem, such as a river basin. For instance the Nile river, which flows through 11 countries, can experience variations inwater availabilitydue to changes in the weather. This will affect the millions who depend on it.Transboundary climate risks can also cross continents and oceans andspawn criseson the other side of the world. These could range fromfood and water shortagesto threats totradeandenergy, wideninginequalities, forcedmigrationsand evengeopolitical conflicts.For instance a drought in East Africa could affect tea production in Kenya. This would lead to an increase in prices for tea drinkers in importing countries, like the UK. Likewise, a typhoon could affect manufacturers in south-east Asia. This could disrupt the supply of electronics to African markets and lead to price hikes or shortages.Africa is particularly vulnerable. Trade routes, supply chains and shared ecosystems span across the continent. A climate-induced disruption in one country can easily ripple into cascading effects in its neighbors. The coordinated management of transboundary climate risks is both a challenge and a necessity.At the recentAfrica climate summitin Kenya, the African Union and other African stakeholders presented theRoadmap for African Resilienceto address this.Theroadmapcontains a series of actions meant to enhance coordination between the regional economic communities and member states in addressing and managing transboundary and cascading climate risks. This is an objective of the African Union'sClimate Change and Resilient Development Strategy and Action Plan 2022–2032.Historically, adaptation efforts have largely addressed localized impacts, such as rising sea levels and coastal communities or frequent droughts and their impact on agricultural yields.As anexperton adaptation toclimate change, I believe that the significance of this roadmap lies in its comprehensive, continent-wide approach. It recognizes that shared challenges require shared solutions. And it underscores Africa's commitment to taking charge of its climate destiny. This makes the roadmap valuable in the evolving discourse on global climateresilience.Unified frontThe Roadmap for African Resilience outlines 25 crucial actions to fortify Africa's resilience against transboundary climate risks. It has a focus on the risks posed toglobal supply chains, energy and food markets.The roadmap's actions can be grouped into four general plans:Recognize the risks: this includes a pan-African transboundary climate risk assessment and the development of risk indicators.Govern together: identify the transboundary risks that each country considers most important. These will be included in different areas of policy.Implement Africa-wide adaptation: create a plan to find the best ways to strengthen communities against transboundary climate risks. Just resilience principles are embedded into this, such as prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable people and upholding human rights and cultural values. The roadmap also kickstarts a program to put these ideas into action.Mobilize resources for resilience: getting more money from multiple countries to support climate action, making sure private investments match public goals by emphasizing systemic resilience, and building capacity to invest together.The Roadmap for African Resilience thus offers a holistic, pan-African vision. It not only identifies transboundary climate risks but also proposes a structured approach for collective action.Implementing the roadmap requires the active involvement of a range of African organizations. These include the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the African Union Commission, the African Union Development Agency—New Partnership for Africa's Development, the African Group of Negotiators Expert Support and the Regional Economic Communities in Africa. In addition, national governments, the private sector, civil society and academia play crucial roles.The challenge will lie in ensuring cohesive action among these entities. Especially when adaptation to climate risks is a relatively new endeavor for some of the above organizations.Significant stepThe inaugural Africa Climate Summit marked a significant step for Africa's collective commitment to resilience. The roadmap acknowledges the reality of Africa's intertwined destinies and the need for collaborative solutions to cross-border climate risks.Given the borderless nature ofclimate risks, global cooperation must be at the heart of adaptation initiatives.","['sweden', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'uk', 'ethiopia']",gb,False,False

Scientists think it is the … [+3256 chars]",Zimbabwe,"A type of bacterium never seen before in wild elephants has been found in the bodies of six African Savannah elephants that died in mysterious circumstances in Zimbabwe. Scientists think it was the cause of a septicaemia, or blood poisoning, that killed the animals in 2020. The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications. The study might provide more clues about the deaths of 356 elephants in neighbouring Botswana that same year. That incident drew international headlines, when conservationists discovered the dead elephants in Botswana's Okavango Panhandle. Some of the animals appeared to have collapsed and died suddenly while walking or running. Researchers who made the discovery were investigating the sudden deaths of 35 elephants - mostly between August and September 2020 in North-Western Zimbabwe. Dr Chris Foggin, a wildlife veterinarian from the Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust explained that the team had to locate the bodies using a helicopter. Wearing protective clothing, in extreme heat, he and his team carried out post-mortem examinations of 15 elephants. ""They're such large animals,"" said Dr Foggin. ""So it's quite a physical operation to get access to the organs we needed to sample."" The researchers managed to confirm that 13 of the elephants had septicaemia when they died. Crucially they found a potential cause - a bacterium called Bisgaard taxon 45 - in six of the animals. It is a type that has been found previously in swabs taken from tiger or lion bites. Prof Falko Steinbach from the UK's Animal and Plant Health Agency, who was involved in the mission, told BBC Radio 4's Inside Science that severe drought and shortage of food that year could have compromised the animals' health, allowing the disease to overcome their immune defences. ""[This type of bacteria] wasn't completely mysterious - it was known to exist,"" explained Prof Steinbach. ""But it had not been associated with septicaemia and never been found in the African elephants."" The scientist said he suspected that the elephants were under ""severe stress"" because of the ongoing drought and difficulty finding food. ""This is relatively common,"" he explained. ""We have a lot of pathogens have that [usually] do not cause disease - and certainly not death. But if the host defences break down, that allows the bacteria to spread and in the end, it doesn't just cause a local infection after a bite - but causes severe disease."" Elephants are highly social animals, so the researchers are concerned that they could also transmit the bacteria to others, which would explain the large number of deaths. Laura Rosen from US-based company Transboundary Epidemiology Analytics, said the finding was ""very worrying"". ""African savannah elephants are an endangered species with only 350,000 remaining in the wild and ongoing losses estimated at 8% annually. Investigating the deaths of these elephants is crucial to sustain the future of this majestic species."" Prof Steinbach added that more research was needed to understand ""the link between this infection and the stress associated with extreme weather events such as drought, which may make outbreaks more likely"". ""Hopefully with further studies, we would be able to identify not only what leads to these outbreaks, but also maybe to come up with intervention strategies - possibly even a vaccine. But that would require substantial further investigation.""","['zimbabwe', 'botswana', 'botswana', 'not found', 'uk', 'us']",gb,False,False

Canadian farmers are looking for ways to deal with recurrent drought, including planting earlier and using seeds that are more resistant to heat. The cost of climate change is growing for companies as extreme weatherdisrupts manufacturing and supply chainsand inflicts billions in economic losses. For the agriculture industry, the threat from rising temperatures ""may be one of the greatest that we face in this lifetime,""according to Corteva, an Indiana company that makes seeds and chemicals. But Corteva — which was previously part of DowDuPont — says it has a plan. There's money to be made producing things like biofuels to powershipsandairplaneswith less climate pollution, and crops that are better atresisting diseasesas the planet gets hotter. And — crucially — Corteva says it is curbing some of its own emissions of the greenhouse gasses that are heating the planet. If it misses deadlines it set for operating more sustainably, the company says its relationships with customers and investors could suffer. However, that hasn't stopped Corteva from working alongside other American companies and lobbyists to limit upcomingregulations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that would make businesses disclosetheir emissions and the risks they face from climate change. Businesses and climate activists have been pushing to shape the SEC rules for months, because the stakes are high. The economy is awash in climate disclosures that companies tout, but there are few ways for customers and investors to gauge the validity of the claims. The SEC's goal is to ensure that publicly-traded corporations are reporting comparable information, and also to make sure they aren't misleading investors about their environmental activities — a practice known as greenwashing, Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, told the House Financial Services Committee in September. And while Gensler has said repeatedly that the SEC isn't writing climate regulations — they're rules for financial reporting — the requirements the agency comes up with could boost efforts to limit global warming. A study published this summer in the journalSciencefound that requiring companies to disclose their emissionscould put pressure on firms to cut their climate pollution. The SEC isn't alone. Regulators in theEuropean Union,United KingdomandHong Konghave been writing their own rules for what companies have to tell investors about climate change. And in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed a pair of bills that will force big companies operating in the state, including Corteva, to publicly disclose theirfinancial risks from global warmingandhow much greenhouse gas pollutioncomes from their operations and supply chains. Corteva, whichoperates a chemical plant in California, didn't respond to multiple messages seeking comment. ""The days of a company trying to avoid reporting their emissions at all are over,"" says Madison Condon, an associate professor at Boston University School of Law who studies climate change and financial risk. Yet even as companies in the United States begin adjusting to that new reality, groups on both sides of the regulatory fight are trying to influence the looming SEC rules. In part, that's because they think the agency's requirements could determine how regulations evolve globally. How the rules are written will dictate the kind of information that companies have to give to investors and could shape the ways that businesses respond to climate change. ""I think there are valid criticisms of the way the EU has rolled out their own disclosure requirements,"" Condon says. ""So, I think it would be great if the U.S. got out there and showed alternative ways of thinking about how these disclosures should be."" Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler testifies during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in September.Mariam Zuhaib/APhide caption Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler testifies during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in September. The fight to influence the SEC's climate rules is part of a larger battle over what kinds of information financial firms should be able to consider when they're making investment decisions. In Washington and in state houses around the country, Republican officials and political operatives have beenattacking investment firms that account for issues related to climate change, saying the practice is aimed at hurting the country's fossil fuel industry. ""Let's be honest, the agenda here is not to provide investors with relevant information, but instead to redirect capital away from fossil energy,"" Rep. Andy Barr, a Republican from Kentucky, said of the SEC's pending climate-disclosure rules at a Congressional hearing in September. The climate rules the SEC proposed in early 2022 are wide-ranging and attracted thousands of public comments. Publicly-traded companies would have to report on the threats they're facing from global warming: how extreme weather, which is being fueled by rising temperatures, is affecting their financial performance and influencing their business strategies. They would also have to say how executives and corporate boards manage those risks. Among the most significant aspects of the SEC rules is a requirement for companies to account for their greenhouse gas emissions, the pollution that's trapping heat close to the Earth and pushing up global temperatures. Under the SEC's proposals, there's an entire chain of production and activity whose pollution corporations would have to calculate. Some of those emissions are obvious. A company that makes shoes, for example, would have to say how much climate pollution is coming from its factories and corporate offices. But at the next layer, the shoemaker would also have to tally emissions that don't come directly from its operations. For example, how much climate pollution is created by the power plants that feed electricity to its factories? And on a third and most controversial level — something calledScope 3 emissions— what's the pollution from the businesses that make the rubber and leather that the shoemaker uses? And how much climate pollution is coming from the ships and trucks that deliver its shoes to customers? In a lot of cases, businesses are already giving investors some of that information, or versions of it. ""You have the majority of public companies getting together with their investors, determining what is material and disclosing it,"" says Tom Quaadman, executive vice president of the Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a lobbying group for American businesses. The word material refers to information thata reasonable investor would think is importantto know about a company. ""So, the appropriate disclosures for the marketplace are already happening,"" Quaadman says. Traffic makes its way through flood waters along the Brooklyn Queens Expressway in New York in September. Climate change makes heavy rain more common, because a hotter atmosphere can hold more moisture.Robert Bumsted/APhide caption Traffic makes its way through flood waters along the Brooklyn Queens Expressway in New York in September. Climate change makes heavy rain more common, because a hotter atmosphere can hold more moisture. But the climate disclosures that businesses like Corteva make vary widely, and they're scattered across company websites and in corporate reports. Experts who support stronger regulations say that investors and the public need standardized information to be able to compare the risks that different companies face from climate change, and to judge whether they're delivering on their emissions pledges. That includespromises from consumer goods businesses, like soda makers and cosmetic companies, to eliminate or offset all of their carbon-dioxide emissions. ""We certainly appreciate that there's been a lot of progress made by companies"" voluntarily reporting information about climate change, says Aron Szapiro, head of government affairs at Morningstar, a financial services company. ""But you don't have that kind of consistent, comparable, comprehensive disclosure right now. And that's where it's important to have a regulator lead."" Without direction and oversight from federal regulators, there's also concern that companies may be engaging in greenwashing. George Georgiev, an associate professor at Emory University School of Law, says some of the climate information that companies are releasing looks more like marketing material than risk disclosures. ""In fact, they're even being prepared by the marketing department versus the investor relations department,"" Georgiev says. ""So, they're painting a certain picture of the company being a green company or being up-to-date in terms of [a] transition to a carbon-neutral economy. And it sends a marketing message, as opposed to a more objective message about both the good and the bad, which is the purpose of the SEC disclosure regime."" California's disclosure laws, which are expected to apply to thousands of public and private companies, will probably have a similar effect. But experts and industry lobbyists say the SEC is in a unique position to influence how companies behave. The agency wields enforcement powers that can encourage companies to closely consider its rules and regulations. And information that companies file with the SEC will likely get more attention from investors and the public than disclosures they submit to California. The American Petroleum Institute (API), which represents the U.S. oil and gas industry, accepts that the SEC may need to require companies to disclose more information about their climate risks, says Aaron Padilla, the group's vice president of corporate policy. But he says the rules that the commission floated last year were too far-reaching. ""We share their objective of wanting to inform investors or present information that consumers and other stakeholders want and need,"" Padilla says. ""But it's a matter of being judicious to get that right."" The SEC is trying to decide whether public companies will have to disclose emissions that are linked indirectly to their businesses, including from their supply chains.BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The SEC is trying to decide whether public companies will have to disclose emissions that are linked indirectly to their businesses, including from their supply chains. In the coming months, the SEC is expected to announce what sort of climate information companies will have to disclose. Corporate lobbyists have been pressuring the agency to pare back its requirements. Environmentalists and investors who focus on sustainability have been pushing back, demanding aggressive regulations that they say are needed to protect everyday investors and professionals managing billions of dollars from the financial risks that are being created by global warming. Now, almost 19 months since the SEC proposed its climate rules, the big question is whether the agency will make companies report the most controversial level of pollution known as Scope 3 emissions. That's the pollution linked indirectly to the theoretical shoe company through its suppliers and distributors. For an oil company, Scope 3 emissions include the climate pollution that's released into the atmosphere when people burn its fuel driving their cars and running their lawnmowers. And for a financial firm, they are the emissions that come from the companies and projects it invests in. Opponents of including Scope 3 emissions in climate reporting argue there's no good way right now to accurately measure that pollution, and that flooding investors with unreliable data would be counterproductive. They also say that requiring public companies to report climate pollution from up and down their supply chains could hurt small businesses they work with. Forcing public companies to ""drive climate disclosure policy through their suppliers and distributors may have negative business and social consequences,"" Corteva, the agriculture company,said in a letter to the SEClast year. But Condon, the Boston University law professor, says it's unlikely that small, private businesses would have to do that. ""There's just no universe in which a midsize supplier, grocery chain, is going to ask a small farmer to specifically report on their emissions,"" she says. ""The supplier will calculate the emissions for the farmer."" Despite its objections — and the difficulty of precise measurement — Corteva is one of thousands of companies that has been voluntarily reporting those indirect emissions from its supply chain to investors. Scope 3 emissions are a huge part of the climate problem. For a lot of companies, they account formore than 70% of their total carbon footprint. At Corteva, those indirect emissions accounted for almost 90% of the greenhouse gas emissions that the company reported last year, though they aren't included in targets the company has set for limiting its climate pollution. ""To ignore those emissions, to me, seems to be avoiding the problem,"" Greg Murphy, an executive vice president ata steel company called Nucor, told NPR this summer. Congressional Democrats echoed that message ina letter they sent to Genslerlate last month, saying that disclosing those indirect emissions is ""central to credible climate-related risk reporting for certain sectors and companies."" It isn't clear what the SEC will do. The agency's rules apply to public companies. Because Scope 3 emissions come from a business's suppliers and customers, that kind of climate pollution often traces back to private companies that aren't under the SEC's jurisdiction. But the SEC is also considering the impact of California's new disclosure laws. One of them will require public and private companies that operate in the state and make more than $1 billion a year in revenue to report all of their greenhouse gas pollution, including those indirect Scope 3 emissions.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'canada', 'canada', 'canada', 'canada', 'us', 'us', 'not found']",us,True,True

In 2018, the damage in Germany alone amounted to around 770 million euros. Making wheat plants more resilient to these stresses could make a significant contribution to safeguarding global food production.As part of the VolCorn project, scientists from four non-university research institutions have been studying, from very different perspectives, howwheat plantsand the microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria that colonize them respond to stress factors caused byextreme weather conditionssuch as drought, flooding or pests.The underlying assumption is that the microbiota, the community of microorganisms in and around the plant, is as important to the plant as microorganisms are to the human immune system. A better understanding of these interactions is therefore central to better preparing plants for these stress situations.Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are produced by the plant and also used to ""communicate"" with the microbiota, play a key role in the plant's defense against these stressors. The researchers have used modern approaches to unravel these complex relationships. They used systems biology methods to study changes inplant metabolismand, at the same time, changes in the microbiota.Microorganisms can help with climate stressThe research shows that floods and droughts not only generally reduce the growth and yield of wheat, but also change the microbiota in the roots and leaves. In particular, more pathogenic microbes colonize the early growth stages. As a result, stressed plants become more susceptible to disease.To the researchers' surprise, however, beneficial bacteria also accumulate in the root zone during flooding, promoting the uptake of nutrients and vitamins by the plant. At the same time, the plant itself massively changes its metabolism.The researchers were able to show that the amino acid alanine plays a central role in maintaining nitrogen supply and metabolism in the stressed plants. ""Presumably, the altered microbiota then makes more supporting vitamins available to support the weakened wheat metabolism in theroot zone,"" explains project coordinator Steffen Kolb from ZALF.Pest infestations affect the formation of VOCs by the wheat plant, which reacts to this form of stress with a defense response. The project also led to the development of a new tool for data analysis of complex mixtures of different VOCs usingmass spectrometry, which will speed up follow-up studies.New insights help breeders and farmers""We hope that in the future we will be able to selectively enrich microbes and their plant-supporting properties to make wheat plants more resilient toclimate change, such as flood stress,"" says Kolb. In plant breeding, for example, work is already underway on programs that encourage plant colonization with supportive microorganisms from the surrounding soil. Another example is the transfer of stress-reducing microorganisms to wheat plants.""The knowledge gained from the multifaceted response of the wheat plant and its microbiota is of great importance for the breeding of climate-resistant wheat varieties and will open new avenues for the systematic management of microorganisms in agricultural crop production. However, furtherexperimental researchis needed due to thecomplex relationshipsinvolved,"" said the project coordinator.Provided by Leibniz-Zentrum für Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF) e.V.Citation: Insights for plant breeding: Arming wheat plants against climate stress with microorganisms (2023, October 26) retrieved 3 November 2023 ",['germany'],gb,False,False

""Wildfires are a problem and they're dangerous,"" they say in their podcast from Chautauqua Elementary School, on Vashon Island. ""But there's ways to prevent them, so respect wildfire safety precautions and do your best to prevent these fires."" This entryfrom Roz Hinds, Jia Khurana and Sadie Pritsky was among more than 100 podcasts this year inNPR's Student Podcast Challengethat touched on a topic that's increasingly important to young people:climate change. Over and over again, student journalists tried making sense of extreme weather events that are becoming more common or more intense: flash floods, hurricanes, droughts, wildfires. Here are four student podcasts that offer a glimpse into the minds of students and what they have to say about climate-related news in their communities — and what they hope to do about it. Behind the Scenes of the Mosquito FireIn a 10-episode series, a sixth-grade class at the Georgetown School of Innovation in Georgetown, Calif., shares stories from the devastatingMosquitoFire in 2022. This group of eight students asks two firefighters from the Georgetown Fire Department what it's like to fight fires and protect loved ones in their hometown. Fires: Set AblazeAt Chautauqua Elementary, the Vashon fifth-graders talk about the far-reaching and lasting impact of wildfires and wildfire smoke — and the direct effects on their lives, like waiting for the school bus on a smoky day. The students also interview experts and share their research on wildfire precautions. Flowing Through Time: The Past, Present, and Future of WaterIn this podcast from Peak Academy, a group of eight middle schoolers reports on dealing with water shortages in Bozeman, Montana. They trace the history of their growing hometown's water supply, which has been dependent on mountain snowmelt. As that source becomes less reliable in a warming world, the students turn to the grown-ups to ask what they can do to conserve water.

While the death toll initially stood at seven, one of the injured died in the hospital overnight, state police said. The crash, involving at least 168 vehicles, occurred on Monday morning as heavy fog conditions severely lowered visibility, according to Louisiana State Police. A long stretch of Interstate 55, a 24-mile-long highway over Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans, is expected to be closed ""for the foreseeable future,"" police said. Interstate 10 and Interstate 310 were also closed as a result of the crash, police said. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards confirmed the accident in a statement Monday. For hours after the crash, emergency crews worked to clear debris from both northbound and southbound lanes, according to state police. A portion of the crash scene on I-55 caught on fire shortly after the initial incident, authorities said. A comprehensive structural inspection will take place once the bridge surface is completely clear of debris, diesel and other chemicals, police said. The super fog was caused by smoke from marsh fires burning in the region combined with dense fog developing in the area early Monday morning bringing extremely low visibility. In some spots, visibility was near zero, creating dangerous driving conditions. Super fogs typically form when condensed water vapor mixes with the smoke and moisture released from damp organic material smoldering from a nearby fire, such as brush, leaves and trees, according to theNational Weather Service. Visibility can be lowered to less than 10 feet as a result, according to the NWS. This has been occurring in the region over the past several mornings, with the location of the densest fog and most dangerous conditions varying day to day, forecasts show. Super fogs can be especially dangerous when they develop near and over highways. The localized nature of the weather phenomenon means that visibility conditions can worsen rapidly within a very short distance, which can lead to a hazardous combination of sudden low to near-zero visibility and vehicles traveling at a high speed on a highway. The very limited visibility then hinders a driver's ability to react to changing conditions on a roadway. The National Weather Service issued a dense fog advisory for much of southeastern Louisiana on Monday morning, including from Baton Rouge to New Orleans. Over the past several days, the National Weather Service has been warning of the threat of dense fog during the early mornings in the region that would be worsened in some areas by nearby marsh fires. State police advised drivers to use their low-beam headlights if they can't see at least 500 feet in front of them. The fog dissipated by mid Monday morning, and all fog alerts have since been canceled. Morning fog is not uncommon this time of the year for the region, but more than 86% of the state is currently battling extreme drought conditions, which is elevating fire danger. This could mean more instances of super fog in the coming days and weeks as cooler temperatures settle in, but the drought and wildfire risk persist. In addition, devastating drought and wildfire conditions continue to impact Louisiana. More than 60% of the state is now categorized at exceptional drought, the highest category of concern, according to theU.S. Drought Monitor. Just three months ago, 0% of the state was listed under exceptional drought. ""The combination of wildfire smoke and dense fog is dangerous, and I want to encourage all Louisianans in affected areas to take extreme caution when traveling,"" Edwards said in a statement. The St. John the Baptist Parish Sheriff's Office, which initially responded to the crash, directed media requests to Louisiana State Police.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",us,True,True

Thick fog and smoke from multiple marsh fires mingled to reduce visibility for drivers commuting on Monday. Twenty-five people were injured in the crash on Interstate 55 in St John the Baptist Parish, said police, who warned the death toll could rise. Some vehicles caught fire and were abandoned, leaving a trail of burnt-out wreckage and mangled metal. The blaze broke out as one of the vehicles involved in the crash was a tanker truck carrying what police called a ""hazardous liquid"". One car was driven off the road and into the water, but the driver was safely rescued, police told WWL-TV. Officers said the motorway will remain closed until at least midday on Tuesday. ""A portion of the crash scene caught on fire shortly after the initial incident. One tanker truck carrying a hazardous liquid is being off-loaded due to a compromised tank/trailer,"" Lt Melissa Matey said in a statement. Mike Tregre, sheriff of St John the Baptist, said an estimated 100 people were stranded and school buses were being used to transport them to their destinations. Clarencia Patterson Reed, 46, who was driving to Hammond, told local media she was able to avoid hitting the car in front of her, but the vehicles behind her began slamming into her car. ""It was 'Boom. Boom.' All you kept hearing was crashing for at least 30 minutes,"" she said. She was able to get out of her car, but her wife was trapped inside and was injured. The National Weather Service (NWS) in New Orleans described the weather phenomenon as a ""super fog"", cautioning that similarly dangerous weather conditions could appear later this week. On its website, it states super fog can form when a mixture of smoke and moisture from damp, smouldering vegetation mixes with cooler air. The smoky conditions reduced visibility to less that 10ft (3m). The NWS said on Tuesday morning that heavy overnight winds had helped to disperse fog in some areas, but warned that dangerous driving conditions persisted in many areas. Governor John Bel Edwards offered his thoughts and prayers for those killed in the crash, and urged residents to donate blood at a local medical centre to ""help replenish supplies that are being drained today to care for the wounded"". Louisiana has battled blazing wildfires, heatwaves and relentless droughts over the course of the summer.

We interviewed 57 informants during the data collection process, including government actors,community leaders, civil society organization activists, and business people.Our research aimed to understand howurban developmentcontributed to urban water problems within the wider context of extreme weather change.It found climate-related problems such as flooding, drought, andheat stressmay affect the whole city, regardless of rich orpoor neighborhoods. However, urban poor populations suffer more severely due to some reasons.While the rich has resources to live in well-planned residential areas, urban poor have to live inparts most vulnerableto floods.In addition to that, they also live in crowded and impoverished neighborhoods with limited access to clean water.Marginalized from formal water services, the urban poor are accustomed torelying on their own creativity for survival. They drill boreholes, make wells, build wet ponds or install rainwater catchment.The same goes when dealing with flooding. They swiftly store valuables in high places, monitor the rise of water level in the nearby drains, creeks or rivers. They also establishcommunication channelsthroughdigital platformsto be informed as soon as possible when flood risks emerge to organize mitigating measures.However, those are merely reactive measures that have nothing to do with addressing the underlying problems.Results from unequal developmentWe found water-related problems in Indonesia, such asflooding and water shortageare closely tiedto unequal developmentacross different parts of the city. All the cities we studied showed common patterns.In certain parts of the city,the economy has experienced significant growthgiving rise to upscale neighborhoods with tall buildings, thriving business districts and real estates with large shopping centers nearby.However, this rapid development has led to surges in land prices, housing rents and the cost of essentials like water and electricity. As a result, these areas have become inaccessible to the urban poor.Meanwhile, in rural and less developed areas, people have converted forests into agricultural lands to meet the increasing demands of city inhabitants, causing disruption of the natural water cycle.As a result, whenextreme weatherstrikes, the urban area struggles to cope. Heavy rainfall increases the risk of flooding, while during droughts they struggle to findclean water.What can we do?Our findings show that profit-seeking activities by developers combined with poor policies have exacerbated water disasters which affected urban poor the most. These communities find it hard to adjust and improve their lives in the midst of urgent water-related issues.However, our study recommended measures that can improve the conditions of urban poor in facing water-related disasters, and not just the reactive ones.The first step is making sure water management practices support the resilience of communities.It's important to consider and tackle inequalities across various areas. For instance, we can integrate the built environment to reconnect people with rivers within urban life.The second step is to consider the risks of climate change when making decisions about water-related institutions and services. We need to find ways to fund preventive measures and disaster response in a sustainable and responsive manner.Lastly, it's crucial to plan our infrastructure carefully. We should include strong and repairable options in our plans. To do this, we need to involve the community in decision-making processes and raise awareness about these issues.In the long run, these recommendations will integrate actions into the whole water cycle to protect services, the environment and public health.","['us', 'southkorea', 'pakistan', 'turkey', 'indonesia', 'indonesia', 'indonesia', 'indonesia', 'not found', 'saudiarabia']",gb,False,False

For example, scientists are already using the data to dig into new techniques for improving long-range forecasting, planning for water resource allocation, and to better understand the causes and impacts of extreme and rareweatherevents.The dataset, known as CONUS404, is the result of a collaboration between the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).""To study rare andextreme weather eventsthat we are really interested in, you need decades worth of data and that data need to be at high resolution,"" said Roy Rasmussen, the NCAR senior scientist who led the project. ""With CONUS404 it is possible to study both long-term events that can stretch for many years, like droughts, and rare events that don't last long but rarely occur, like extreme floods.""Filling a gap for water managersThe weather in the United States is relatively well observed by local weather stations, stream gauges, snowpack sensors, radars, weather balloons, satellites, and more. But on their own, these observations cannot always give a clear picture of how weather patterns may be changing over time. That's because the data are often regionally clumped—with sparse information on conditions in remote and rugged terrain—and unreliable. The accuracy of temperature, humidity, winds and other important weather data, for example, can be affected by instrument performance and local conditions. And measurements across different observational platforms do not always line up.Because of these factors, scientists rely on meteorological ""reanalyses"" that combine observations and modeling to create datasets that provide internally consistent weather information at fixed points on a grid across an entire region or the globe. These reanalysis products are important tools for scientists. For example, they can be used to verify how wellclimate modelsare able to simulate past conditions—a crucial test for determining how well they might be doing at simulating the future. Scientists also use these products to initialize, or ""kick off,""model simulationswith real-world conditions.Despite the importance of reanalysis products, they are generally low resolution with about 30 kilometers (19 miles) or more between grid points—a spacing too coarse to capture relatively fine-scale weather events, like summer thunderstorms, and the local topography that impacts those events, like mountain ranges. They're also too coarse to give meaningful data about precipitation in individual watersheds, which is critical information for water managers. It's this last point that has been a particular frustration for the USGS, which is responsible for collecting and distributing information to the nation about water resources, including streamflow and groundwater data.To address this gap, the USGS partnered with NCAR to ""downscale"" one of the most widely used global reanalysis datasets, called ERA5, to create a high-resolution dataset for the contiguous United States (CONUS) using NCAR's Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF).The resulting dataset covers more than 40 years (1980–2021) at 4-kilometer grid spacing—hence the name, CONUS404.A weather simulation that covers such a large area over such a long time at such a high resolution has never before been possible. But several factors have come together over the last decade to make the undertaking practical, including an advancement in capabilities of both supercomputing and of weather models. Even with advances in computing, it still took more than 11 months to complete the simulation on the USGS Denali supercomputing system.Improvements in WRF over the last few years have corrected several issues that showed up in earlier attempts to run the model at high resolution over CONUS, though for shorter time periods. One problem was that WRF tended to make the central U.S. too hot and too dry, which in turn affected the ability of the model to accurately simulate thunderstorms in the region. But the updated version of WRF includes a groundwater module that both cools and dampens the area, leading to a much more realistic simulation. The updated version also does a better job of simulating Western snowpack, which affects stream runoff andsurface temperatures, and corrects a tendency in the model to make wintertime temperatures too cold in snow-covered regions.""We're now able to capture the primary factors that are causing the weather in the real world,"" Rasmssen said. ""We're not perfect, and we're still learning all the time, but the model does a striking job of getting the historical weather right.""Digging into the dataThe paperintroducing the dataset was published earlier this summer in theBulletin of the American Meteorological Society, but many scientists are already digging into the data to answer their research questions. For example, the CONUS404 dataset has helped researchers uncover patterns during historical droughts that are now being used to improve seasonal drought predictions in the West.Scientists are also looking for subtle evidence of changing weather patterns over the last few decades, including one study that has identified a shift in the way precipitation falls, from less drizzle and light rain to more downpours. Climate models have long predicted that this change should be occurring, but the low-resolution reanalysis datasets that existed up to this point were not detailed enough to pinpoint the change.Researchers are also analyzing changes to the damaging local winds that sometimes accompany storms. Other scientists are looking at extremes in streamflow and whether CONUS404 data can be used as an input into crop models to simulatewater useand food production.While the new dataset has just begun to be tapped, the NCAR-USGS collaboration is already working on part two of the project: another 40-plus year simulation of weather across the United States, this time in the future. The scientists will be using the same methodology, but instead of downscaling a reanalysis of what has happened in the past, they'll be using data from NCAR's Community Earth System Model, version 2, (CESM2) to project what they believe conditions will be like in the future. Together, the two datasets will provide more than 80 years of simulated data that will give an unprecedented look of how our weather may continue to change as the climate warms.""Connecting these two pieces—NCAR's climate and weather modeling—is extremely important,"" said NCAR scientist Andreas Prein, a co-author of the study. ""We have to be smart about how we use the climate data to bring it to a scale that's useful.""CONUS404 data is freely accessible fromNCAR's Research Data Archive.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us']",gb,False,False

A severe drought means that the human faces carved into rocks on the shore can now be easily spotted. Some had been sighted during a previous drought but archaeologists say they have been able to locate a greater variety of the carvings this time. The discovery was made in the city of Manaus, in northern Brazil. They are located on a stretch of shore known as Ponta das Lajes, near where the Rio Negro and the Solimões river flow into the Amazon. Archaeologist Jaime Oliveira told local media that they were carved by people who lived in the area in pre-Columbian times. ""This region is a pre-colonial site which has evidence of occupation dating back some 1,000 to 2,000 years,"" he said. ""What we're seeing here are representations of anthropomorphic figures."" Another rock has grooves thought to have been used by indigenous people in the area to sharpen their arrows. The carvings were last seen in 2010, when the water level of the Rio Negro dropped to 13.63m (44.7 ft). On Sunday, the river's level dropped for the first time to below 13m and on Monday it fell even further to 12.89m. The Brazilian government attributes the drought to climate change and the El Niño weather phenomenon, which has caused the volume of rainfall in the northern Amazon to fall below the historical average and river levels to drop to near record levels.","['brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'angola']",gb,False,False

The combination ofthe El Niño phenomenonand anthropogenic climate change has played a significant role in accentuating this extreme weather event. The Amazon region, known for its lush rainforest and flowing rivers, is facing a critical situation due to a lack of rainfall and rising temperatures.This phenomenon, never recorded at this intensity, has affected biodiversity and human life in eight Amazonian states.The droughthas already killed more than 140 dolphins, including pink dolphins and tucuxis, also known as gray dolphins. The mortality of fish and otheraquatic animalsis also high.The low volume of the rivers affects the human supply, causing a lack of drinking water and food in all the small villages, even those located on the banks of the big rivers. Of the 62 municipalities in the state of Amazonas, 42 are in astate of emergency, 18 are in a state of alert and only two are in a normal situation.The El Niño phenomenon has a direct influence on the Amazondrought. It manifests itself in the abnormal warming of the surface waters of the Pacific Ocean, affecting the rainfall regime in various parts of the world. In the case of the Amazon region, the drought is exacerbated by a decrease in humidity and a lack of rainfall, damaging the vegetation, fauna andlocal communitiesthat depend on natural resources.However,anthropogenic climate changeis making the situation even worse. Rampantdeforestation, driven by agricultural expansion and logging activity, reduces the Amazon rainforest's ability to regulate the climate and retain moisture. In addition, the destruction of vast areas of vegetation contributes to rising temperatures, creating a cycle of even more accentuated droughts.Deforestation and mining, major factorsDeforestation has been particularly devastating in the region ofHighway BR-319, in the south of Amazonas state, driven byland grabbingwhich has provided cheap land to cattle ranchers from other states. In turn, this deforestation has increased the number of fires that feed back into the climate crisis. When they occur near riverbanks, deforestation also intensifies thephenomenon known as fallen land, which has drastically affected the draft of rivers and is already significantly jeopardizing navigation and logistics, mainly affecting villages in the interior of the Amazon, which are already suffering from shortages.Another factor that has played a significant role in affecting navigation is mining activity. Disorganized mineral extraction has created banks of land that are harmful to navigation and which, in the critical scenario of drought, have caused many vessels to run aground.The impact of hydroelectric damsHydroelectric dams also play a role in contributing to the drought scenario,especially on the Madeira River. This is mainly due to the decomposition of organic matter in reservoirs created by dams, which releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. In addition, deforestation associated with the construction of dams, as well as soil degradation and erosion resulting from the alteration of aquatic andterrestrial ecosystems, can increase emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants, contributing to the impact of hydroelectric dams on climate change.The Madeira River, now at its lowest level in almost 60 years, has been drastically affected and transformed by the Jirau and Santo Antôniohydroelectric dams. This was due to the drastic alteration of the river's natural flow caused by the damming of water for power generation. When water is dammed, a reservoir is formed that retains part of the water that would normally flow along the river. This diversion of the flow directly affects the region's aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, since the basin's hydrological cycle is interrupted. The reduction in the volume of water in the Madeira River, for example, can lead to prolonged periods of drought, affecting not only aquatic fauna and riparian habitats, but also local communities that depend on the river for their livelihoods.In addition, the construction and operation of hydroelectric dams in the Amazon often involves the clearing of significant areas of forest for the construction of dams and associated infrastructure. Deforestation contributes to a reduction in evapotranspiration, which is a crucial process for water balance in the region. With fewer trees to release water into the atmosphere, the Amazon becomes more susceptible to drought. The combination of these factors results in a significant impact on the region, making hydroelectric dams one of the causes of drought in the Amazon, particularly on the Madeira River, with worrying environmental and social consequences.What can still be doneIn order to combat the extreme drought in the Amazon and its devastating effects, it is essential to adopt strict measures to curb deforestation and illegal mining in the region, and for thefederal governmentto review major undertakings such as hydroelectric dams and roads, such as the BR-319 motorway.Many politicians have argued that the road, if paved, could reduce the state's isolation, especially during droughts. However, this is a fallacious argument, because connecting the most isolated municipalities would require hundreds of kilometers of side roads, which would further increase deforestation and aggravate the climate crisis.In addition, the BR-319 motorway has become a spearhead that cuts through one of the most conserved blocks of forest, linking the central Amazon, which is still preserved, to the ""arc of Amazonian deforestation"", a region that concentrates most of the climate anomalies in the entire biome.Ecosystem on the edgeIn arecent studypublished in the journalConservation Biology, it was shown that deforestation in the Amazon is already impacting ecosystem services that are essential for Brazil, such as the Amazon's flying rivers. Thisscientific datashows that we are already at the threshold of deforestation and environmental degradation tolerated by the Amazon, and more forceful action needs to be taken now.Part of this responsibility lies now in the hands of President Lula, in reviewing major developments in the Amazon, such ashydroelectric damsand highways like the BR-319. In addition, it is essential to institute a zero deforestation policy that should begin this year, and not in 2030, when it will be too late. Furthermore, it is crucial that the international community and local governments work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change effectively. Only with coordinated and decisive action will we be able to mitigate the impacts of drought in the Amazon and protect this unique ecosystem that plays a vital role in regulating the global climate.Journal information:Conservation Biology","['brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil']",gb,False,False

Nonetheless, little is known about the relationship of water use by sectors and the occurrence of drought-heat-wave events, particularly at the large scale.To explore this issue, a group of researchers from the Department of Physical Geography from Utrecht University evaluated the responses of sectoral water use during droughts, heat waves and compound (combined) events at a global scale. The study, ""Sectoral water use responses to droughts and heat waves: analyses from local to global scales for 1990-2019,"" published inEnvironmental Research Letters, shows that stronger sectoral water use responses are found for heat waves compared to impacts during droughts.The research is the first global study quantifying sectoral water use responses under extremes droughts, heat waves and compound events. Sectoral water use responses are understood as how the water use practices of sectors (namely domestic, irrigation, thermoelectric energy, manufacturing and livestock) are affected by the occurrence of droughts, heat waves and compound events, which could lead them to increase or decrease their use of water or to show no particular reaction to these hydroclimatic extremes.A large amount of data of sectoral water use at global, country and local scales during the last 30 years were analyzed. ""We focused on the water used by various sectors, namely irrigation, livestock, domestic, energy and manufacturing, because we expected particular responses to the occurrence of differentextreme events,"" says Gabriel Cardenas Belleza, Ph.D. candidate at Utrecht University and lead author of this publication.The analysis shows that extreme events over the last thirty years had substantial impacts on water use patterns, but these responses highly differ per sector and region across the world.""Socio-economic factors and public water management plans strongly influence water use responses, and even more so during extreme events. For instance, while Western continental United States decreases its water use during extremes, the central US increases it,"" says Cardenas. In addition, the results reveal that the domestic and irrigation sectors, in general, have the highest priority for water use worldwide, however, stricter measures are taken in favor of the domestic sector during extremes.The analysis also shows that heat waves and compound drought-heat wave events overall have stronger impacts on water use in comparison to solely droughts. ""Heat waves and compound events can lead to higher water use as a consequence of the temporary increase in water demand under high temperatures, which can still be satisfied due to the short duration of such extremes, compared to longer-lasting events like droughts,"" says Cardenas.The results of the study demonstrate the urgency of collecting more water use data to better understand the implications of extreme events andclimate changeon different water use sectors and for improved assessments of future water scarcity.""Our research provides a first step to evaluate multi-sectoral water use behavior during extremes. However, more local-scale information from data-scarce areas, like Africa and parts of Asia and South America, is needed to better understand sectoral water use behavior and improve water management strategies,"" Cardenas says.","['unitedstates', 'us']",gb,False,False

That's a welcome boon to a state that has spent much of the past dozen years in a deep drought, forcing state leaders to grapple with how the state should share and manage its water in the future. A series of winter storms in early 2023 busted the state's most recent dry spell. State officials measured 33.56 inches (85.2 centimeters) of precipitation through the end of September. California's “water year” begins annually on Oct. 1 so it can include all of the fall and winter months when California gets the bulk of its rain and snow. The state depends on those wet months to fill its reservoirs that supply water for drinking, farming and environmental uses throughout the state. Those reservoirs dipped to dangerously low levels in in recent years because of an extreme drought. That prompted water restrictions on homes and businesses and curtailed deliveries to farmers. It also threatened already endangered species of fish, including salmon, that need cold water in the rivers to survive. Statewide, reservoirs held 27.4 million acre feet of stored water as September ended. One acre foot of water is enough to supply two families of four for a year. Of that, about 4.5 million acre feet are held in the State Water Project, a network of 30 reservoirs and storage facilities that provides water to 27 million people. “This was as close to a miracle year as you can get,” said Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources. The reservoirs were helped by a series of nine strong storms that hit California over the winter. Those storms carried so much rain and snow they were known as “atmospheric rivers.” They caused widespread flooding throughout the state and were blamed for multiple deaths. The storms also dumped tons of snow on the mountains. The state snowpack on April 1 was 237% above its historical average. It's just the fourth time since 1950 the state's snowpack exceeded 200% of average, according to Michael Anderson, the state's climatologist. All of that snow melted in the spring and summer, filling rushing rivers and reservoirs. Water levels at Lake Oroville rose 240 feet (73 meters) between Dec. 1, 2022, and the end of the snowmelt period. That's the largest increase in storage in one season since the reservoir opened in 1968, according to Ted Craddock, deputy director for the State Water Project. State and federal officials will have to drain some of the reservoirs to make room for more water that's expected to come this year. The state's rainy season could be complicated by El Nino — the natural, temporary and occasional warming of part of the Pacific Ocean. El Nino affects weather patterns around the world. California typically gets more rain and snow during El Nino year. This year’s El Nino has a 56% chance to be considered strong and a 25% chance to reach supersized levels, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The potential for more strong storms this year, particularly along the coast, “keeps me awake a little bit at night,” said Gary Lippner, deputy director for flood management and dam safety with the California Department of Water Resources. “We just do not have extensive flood systems on the coast of California,” he said. “That's an area we're paying particularly attention to.” All of the rain and snow this year could have played a part in what has so far been a smaller wildfire season. Wildfires exploded in size during the drought in part because of the super dry conditions. So far this year, just over 476 square miles (1,234 square kilometers) have burned in California. That's well below the five year average of 2,031 square miles (5,260 square kilometers), according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. ___ This story has been updated to correct the amount of acre feet of storage the reservoirs in the State Water Project finished the year with. It was 4.5 million acre feet, not 27.4 million.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",us,True,True

It's not clear who would have made these engravings, but scientists think they are linked to indigenous cultures who lived in the area inpre-Columbian times. ""The engravings are prehistoric, or precolonial. We cannot date them exactly, but based on evidence of human occupation of the area, we believe they are about 1,000 to 2,000 years old,"" archaeologist Jaime Oliveira of the Brazilian Institute of Historical Heritage, told Reuters Monday. ""The site expresses emotions, feelings, it is an engraved rock record, but it has something in common with current works of art,"" said Oliveira,per Agence France Presse(AFP). Rock carvings had been spotted before at the site, notably during another drought in 2010. One area at the site appeared to show grooves in the rock used by indigenous populations to sharpen their spear, per Reuters. But archaeologists had never before spotted the mysterious faces, Oliveira toldReuters Monday.

SAO PAULO — More than 100 dolphins have died in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest in the past week as the region grapples with a severe drought, and many more could die soon if water temperatures remain high, experts say. The Mamiraua Institute, a research group of Brazil's Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, said two more dead dolphins were found Monday in the region around Tefe Lake, which is key for mammals and fish in the area. Video provided by the institute showed vultures picking at the dolphin carcasses beached on the lakeside. Thousands of fish have also died, local media reported. Experts believe high water temperatures are the most likely cause of the deaths in the lakes in the region. Temperatures since last week have exceeded 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Tefe Lake region. The Brazilian government's Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation, which manages conservation areas, said last week it had sent teams of veterinarians and aquatic mammal experts to investigate the deaths. There had been some 1,400 river dolphins in Tefe Lake, said Miriam Marmontel, a researcher from the Mamiraua Institute. ""In one week we have already lost around 120 animals between the two of them, which could represent 5% to 10% of the population,"" said Marmontel. Workers have recovered carcasses of dolphins since last week in a region where dry rivers have impacted impoverished riverside communities and stuck their boats in the sand. Amazonas Gov. Wilson Lima on Friday declared a state of emergency due to the drought. Nicson Marreira, mayor of Tefe, a city of 60,000 residents. said his government was unable to deliver food directly to some isolated communities because the rivers are dry. Ayan Fleischmann, the Geospatial coordinator at the Mamirauá Institute, said the drought has had a major impact on the riverside communities in the Amazon region. ""Many communities are becoming isolated, without access to good quality water, without access to the river, which is their main means of transportation,"" he said. Fleischmann said water temperatures rose from 32 C (89 F) on Friday to almost 38 C (100 F) on Sunday. He said they are still determining the cause of the dolphin deaths but that the high temperature remains the main candidate.","['brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil']",us,False,False

And why was so much of Russia listed as tundra?Almost always, those maps were based on the climate classification system proposed by Wladimir Köppen. The colors are chosen to suit our imagination: Australia with its red desert center, surrounded by a yellow or orange semi-arid fringe and more lush green climates along many coastlines and hinterland.But these maps were made for a climate that doesn't exist any more. Ournew researchshows just how fastclimate changehas altered these maps—and how they will continue to change.Our web applets you see for yourselffor any country in the world and for different emission scenarios. For Australia, you can watch the hot desert area expand and the temperate areas shrink.The climate map of the future below assumes nations meet their climate goals. It could be far worse. Or it could be better, if we finally treat climate change with the urgency it needs.How do you classify a climate?Köppen was a 19th century Russian botanist who later retrained in meteorology. Over his career, he combined both interests, becoming fascinated by the relationship between climate and types of vegetation.Around 1900, he proposed the influential climate classification system which now bears his name alongside his collaborator, Rudolf Geiger. It remains by far the most used classification system, as it combines different aspects of climate data into types of landscapes and vegetation types we can actually picture, from rainforests, savannahs and deserts to temperate andboreal forests, tundras, glaciers and ice sheets.The Köppen-Geiger classification has five major climate classes: tropical, dry, temperate, cold and polar. These are divided into 30 subclasses based on the amount of rain and temperatures in summer and winter.You might think it would be relatively straightforward to figure out if climate change has pushed a region into a new classification. Add the recorded global warming of 1.2°C so far and see if that changes anything.Alas, it's not that simple. This is because climate change can have weird regional effects. We're getting much more rain in some areas, and much less in others. Some regions are warming faster than the global average and others are warming slower.Climate models predict there will continue to be such differences. Plus, a degree of warming will have a greater impact at the edge of a glacier than in the Sahara.To find out what will happen, we analyzed vast databases of past weather observations and future climate projections under different socio-economic and emission pathways to redraw the Köppen map. We did so at a very fine scale, dividing the world up into square kilometers so we could observe localized changes in mountainous regions and on small islands.Change has already happened—and there's much more to comeThe results were surprising. In some parts of the world,climate zoneshave already shifted considerably since Köppen drew his first climate map more than a century ago. The fastest change has been in the last few decades. The largest changes have been in cold and polar climates, which have become less cold and sometimes drier.Eastern Europe has been a climate change hotspot over the last century. Its continental climate of cold winters andwarm summershas given way to a temperate climate with hot summers.Several countries have already changed climate zones across more than half of their area. Hungary, for instance, has changed the most of any nation. A whopping 81% of the country has already moved into a different, more temperate climate zone. Other global hot spots include central Europe, the Middle East and South Korea.Our projections show these regions are among those to undergo the biggest climatic shifts through to 2100. Some areas will shift climate zones more than once.Countries athigher latitudeswill see some of the largest changes. Almost a quarter (24%) of both Canada and Russia have already moved into another climate zone since Köppen's first map. Another 39-40% of their immense landmasses will follow suit before the end of the century.A similar story applies to Europe, where climate zones will change in between one-third and two-thirds of the area in most countries.Credit:Adam Peterson/Wikimedia,CC BY-NDSouth Africa and neighboring countries Eswatini and Lesotho are the fastest changing countries in the Southern Hemisphere. Their climate zones have shifted across 28% of their combined area. By 2100, an additional 44% will change.In Australia, climate zones have already shifted across 14% of the country, with another 13% predicted during the remainder of this century.You might wonder how it can be that climate zones don't move in some areas. That is because each Köppen climate zone represents a specific range of temperature and rainfall conditions, and a region can move within that range.But Köppen didn't foresee what's happening now. In his classification, deserts and tropical climates are at the high end of the temperature scale and cannot change—they just get hotter.What will this mean on the ground?Changes as dramatic and rapid as this are already upending natural ecosystems. As climate change progresses, it will force significant change to our farms and infrastructure. Humanity gets half its calories fromjust three plants—rice, maize and wheat—and each of these has a preferred climate.Warmer and drier climates bring more drought as well as crop loss, water shortages, ecosystem degradation, bushfires and desertification. Warmer winters,extreme heat, drought and fire have been pummeled forests the world over—from the cold high latitudes in Canada and Russia to the dry forests in the Mediterranean region, California and Australia. Even the Amazon rainforest is affected.Of course, some changes may be beneficial for people, such as better agricultural conditions or lower heating costs in cold regions. But the overall picture is one of calamitous change.Over the next decades, it will take all of humanity's commitment and ingenuity to avoid a majorclimatecatastrophe.","['russia', 'russia', 'russia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'hungary', 'southkorea', 'canada', 'canada', 'cc', 'unitedstates']",gb,False,False

The days are growing shorter, the temperature cooler, and the leaves are changing color.The delayed onset of autumn in 2023 is not a one off. It's actually part of a broader trend in which the shift from summer to winter is happening later in the year. Myown researchthat I've carried out over the past 13 years points towardsclimate changeas the likely culprit.One of the most noticeable effects ofclimatechange is the changing patterns of vegetation seasonality around us. This includes the timing of important biological events such as bud burst, the appearance of the first leaves, flowering and leaf fall.In general, the appearance of the first leaf marks the arrival ofspring, while leaf fall signals the beginning of autumn. The timing of these events is changing, particularly in thenorthern hemisphere, where spring appears to be starting earlier and autumn's onset is being delayed.Traditionally, monitoring vegetation seasonality involved meticulously documenting these seasonal events year after year. The earliest records of spring events in the UK date back to 1736, when naturalistRobert Marshambegan recording the timing of spring events in Norwich, England.Today,satellite datahas become an essential tool for tracking changes in vegetation seasonality. This data can be used to estimate vegetation vigor (an indicator of vegetation's condition, strength and lushness). Changes can then be used to identify the start and end of each growingseason.Longer growing seasonsClimate researchers now have nearly five decades of satellite observations at their disposal. Analysis of this data reveals that spring has advanced by approximately 15 days, while autumn has been delayed by a similar amount. The overall outcome has been the extension of the growing season by an entire month over the past three decades.The shift in the timing of the seasons is particularly pronounced at higher latitudes. Vegetation situated more than 55° north of the equator, such as in the larch forests of northern Russia, has shown a trend towards an extended growing season, increasing by up to one day per year.A longer growing season is not necessarily a bad thing. It means a longer period of photosynthesis, which theoretically could boostnet carbon uptake—although there isno concrete evidencefor this yet.But an earlier onset of the growing season exposes plants to the risk of damage from spring frosts and an increased vulnerability to summer drought.Researchhas found that anearly springin central and northern Europe in 2018 promoted increased vegetation growth. This, in turn, contributed to soil losing its moisture quickly, amplifying summer drought conditions.Role of climate changeTemperature isone of the primary factorsinfluencing vegetation growth at high northerly latitudes. So, an earlier onset of spring and a later arrival of autumn are probably driven by the risingglobal mean temperature. Since 1981, the global mean temperature has increased by0.18°C per decade.Nonetheless, the influence of temperature on the duration of the growing season may change depending on the type of vegetation. In ecosystems primarily dominated by forests, awarmer climatecan lead tomore photosynthesis and increased vegetation productivity.On the other hand, in a warmer climate, more water evaporates from the Earth's surface, drying out the soil. This could adversely affect the growth of plants with shallow roots, such as grasses andherbaceous plants.Another consequence of climate change is the increased frequency of droughts during the peak of the growing season. Drought conditions result in severe water stress for plants, leading to the premature shedding of leaves or a change in their color, a phenomenon often referred to as a ""false autumn"".The UKexperienced such conditionsin August 2022, when there was an early leaf fall and the browning of leaves, as the country grappled with anextreme heat wave.A longer and drier growing season can also increase the risk of forest fires. AUS studyfrom 2006 revealed a significant surge in wildfire activity within the forests of the northern Rockies from the mid-1980s. This change was closely linked to increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt.Climate change is having a clear impact on vegetation growth and seasonality.

Butclimate changecould reverse this positive development. Heavy rainfall and dry periods change the chemodynamics of the river.The Panke is a small river that rises in the Barnim near Bernau and flows into the Spree in Berlin. Of its 29 kilometers of flow, 20 kilometers are on Berlin city territory. ""Stinky Panke"" it was called in the 19th century, when industry and growing settlements turned the river into a cesspool. But from the 1980s onward, the Panke steadily improved.""Panke 2015"" was the first joint project of the states of Berlin and Brandenburg to implement the EU Water Framework Directive. ""Since then, a lot has been invested in renaturation measures, but the Panke is and remains a highly urbanized river that is exposed to diverse human influences andenvironmental changes,"" said Dr. Christian Marx, researcher at TU Berlin who conducted the study as part of his doctorate.The research team evaluated more than 30 years of data on hydroclimate and more than 60 years of data on water quantity and quality of the Panke to find out how the effects of management measures and changing environmental conditions affected the river. The work ispublishedin the journalScience of the Total Environment.""Although the lower reaches of the catchment are still fed by the treated wastewater of about 700,000 people, and about 30% of the catchment is used for agriculture, the water quality in terms of nitrogen nutrients and phosphate is generally good to sufficient for an urban water body and has improved significantly over time at most sites,"" said Professor Dörthe Tetzlaff, Head of Department at IGB and co-author.The data show that this is a result of changes in management, restoration and more effective wastewater treatment. The general decrease in fertilizer use has also led to lower nitrate and ammonium pollution. These positive developments were particularly evident after management measures between 1985 and 2000, where investments led to an improvement in water quality from quality Class IV to Class II or better. With Class II status, the German target for meeting the chemical requirement of the European Water Framework Directive has also been achieved in the upper reaches.Ammonium and phosphate increase in dry periods, nitrate decreasesThe long-term data also show that water chemistry has deteriorated again due to hydroclimatic dynamics such as long dry periods, as in 2018, and heavy rainfall events, as in 2017. ""In general, the influence of hydroclimate on water quality increases with the degree of urbanization, from upstream to downstream. Hydroclimate also influences the function of water treatment inwastewater treatment plants. So, for a river like the Panke, which is largely fed by treated wastewater in dry periods, this can play a significant role,"" explained Marx.When precipitation is lacking in dry periods, pollutants enter wastewater treatment plants less diluted. Wastewater treatment plants with activated sludge treatment may benefit from lower volumes with longer retention times and higher biological activity during drought periods, but at the same time ammonium concentrations increase, suggesting inhibition of nitrification or a concentration effect. However, the increased ammonium concentrations are—at least so far—harmless due to the generally improved water quality and resilience.Concentrations for phosphate were highest during extremes: drought and long wet periods. This is due to altered hydrological connectivity and substance-specific flow pathways. Nitrate concentrations were lower during dry periods and higher during wet periods as a result of differences in the mobility and connectivity of agricultural soils to the stream network upstream in the catchment.However, impacts on water quality classes below Class II were not exceeded. ""These findings from the Panke catchment underline the importance of strategic adaptation and improvement of water treatment and water resource management to improve the quality of urban watercourses. They also show how important long-term, integrated data sets are. That is why we are also continuing our detailed process-based research and investigations on the Panke,"" concluded Tetzlaff.","['germany', 'germany', 'germany', 'germany', 'unitedstates', 'mexico']",gb,False,False

There are hopes the goal will be met this year.""Old promises must be kept, including the $100 billion pledge made over a decade ago,"" Jaber said on Sunday.Last year's COP27 talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, ended with the first ever creation of a ""loss and damage"" fund into which countries would pay to support poorer nations suffering the most from more intense and frequent storms, floods and droughts.The fund's operation, governance, location, contributors, beneficiaries and a timeline for payouts are all up in the air ahead of COP28.""We must make the fund for loss and damage that was promised in Sharm el-Sheikh a reality in Dubai,"" Jaber said.Climate 'crossroads'The talks in Riyadh are intended to ""shine a spotlight on challenges and solutions in a region that is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change,"" organizers said in a press release on Sunday.The region must already grapple with high temperatures andwater scarcity, with more than 60 percent of the population having ""very little if any access to potable water"", the statement said.""Increasing temperatures are predicted to lead to more persistent and acute drought,"" it added.Jaber also highlighted challenges facing the region, referring toextreme eventslike hurricane-strength Storm Daniel, which last month caused two dams in eastern Libya to burst and flood the city of Derna.""Climate change isn't a threat waiting around the corner—the MENA region knows this from first-hand experience with fierce heat waves and water shortages,"" said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme.Simon Stiell, executive secretary of UN Climate Change, said the region was ""at a crossroads, facing not only the devastating impacts ofclimate changebut also the challenge of transitioning their economies to ensure prosperity in a 1.5C aligned world.""The goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels was set at the 2015climate talksin Paris.","['unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'spain', 'saudiarabia', 'saudiarabia', 'saudiarabia', 'unitedkingdom', 'india', 'us', 'unitedstates', 'not found', 'not found', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'libya', 'libya', 'france']",gb,True,False

No structures or homes were threatened and no evacuations were ordered. Multiple helicopters from the Honolulu Fire Department, the U.S. Army and the state dropped buckets of water on the blaze from the air for a second straight day. Mililani and Wahiawa are the towns closest to the flames, but they weren't at risk. Army installations Schofield Barracks and Wheeler Army Airfield are also in the area, which is about about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Honolulu. Video footage shot by the state Department of Land and Natural Resources showed white and brown smoke rising from green forests. Black and grey patches covered already scorched hillsides. Firefighters battled flames from the air because the terrain is rough and inaccessible. The fire was moving east on a ridge and was 30% contained by midafternoon Tuesday, the Honolulu Fire Department said in a news release. The fire burned through heavy timber and native vegetation, the state said. Hawaii's tropical forests evolved without experiencing frequent fires and flames aren't a part of their natural life cycle. Invasive plants often grow on burned lands, which increases the risk of future wildfires, according to a 2013 state action plan for koa forests. The report said climate change was expected to worsen Hawaii's wildfire problem. Oahu is currently going through a dry spell even though the winter rainy season began in October. The U.S. Drought Monitor said Central Oahu was in moderate drought as of last week. In August, multiple wildfires erupted on Maui including a blaze that killed at least 99 people and destroyed more than 2,000 structures in Lahaina. Powerful winds related to ahurricanepassing far to Hawaii’s south helped fuel that fire and prevented firefighters from using helicopters to tackle the flames.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",us,True,True

National security is no exception. TheNational Intelligence Council has foundthat ""climate change will increasingly exacerbate risks to U.S. national security interests as the physical impacts increase and geopolitical tensions mount about how to respond to the challenge.""The U.S. Defense Department recognizes that climate change is a ""threat multiplier"" as it exacerbates existing environmental stresses andsecurity risks. In a2021 Department of Defensereport, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that almost everything the U.S. Defense Department (DOD) does to defend the American people is jeopardized by climate change—the department's strategies, plans, capabilities, missions, and equipment—and the risks are growing, especially since the world is not on track to meet its Paris Agreement goals. The risks lie not only within U.S. borders; our partner countries impacted by climate change affect American national security interests as well, he said.Jason Bordoff, director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, goes further. ""DOD and the wider national security community need to broaden their definition of 'climate risk,'"" he said. ""There's been plenty of analysis conducted on the exposure and risk to military infrastructure from rising sea level, storms, etc., but there will also be less direct impacts of climate change, such as competition over critical minerals or political instability in resource-rich nations as fossil fuel use eventually dwindles.""Here is a look at the national security challenges posed by climate change.Direct threatsInfrastructureSea-level rise andextreme weatherare affecting both the military's infrastructure and its supply chains. Installations and facilities near coasts are eroding and flooding.In 2013, Fort Irwin in California experienced flash flooding that cost over $65 million in damages. In Virginia, the Norfolk Naval Station, the world's largest naval base, experiences routine flooding during rainstorms and high tides. This impacts the Navy's ability to conduct operations in the Atlantic Ocean, and hampers its work on ships and submarines in the shipyard. U.S.military baseson Guam and the Marshall Islands are also vulnerable tosea-level rise. Damage from 2018's Hurricane Michael shut down Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida for months; rebuilding it was estimated to cost $3.6 billion. Rising temperatures and extreme precipitation at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri can prevent stealth nuclear bombers from taking off.Global supply chains are also disrupted by extreme weather, which may hinder the military's ability to access critical supplies. Technology sectors such as artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, and semiconductors are essential to U.S. national security. But in 2021, severe flooding in Malaysia, a major hub for semiconductor assembly and packaging, disrupted the supply chain, contributing to a global semiconductor shortage.Extreme weather makes outdoor training and military exercises difficult and can affect the maintenance and effectiveness of weapons systems and other equipment. This means existing and new equipment will need to be redesigned to enable it to operate in all climate conditions. Weather conditions can also limit the amount of land available for training and reduce water supplies. Heat waves and other extreme weather can decrease personnel productivity and impact military members' health.Demand for military resourcesThe physical impacts of climate change increase the frequency, scale, and complexity of defense operations and make them more costly.Because natural disasters are increasing, the military is being called on more frequently as first responders for disaster and humanitarian relief and must respond to situations beyond their usual scope. For example, between 2016 and 2021, the number of National Guard personnel days spent fighting wildfires increased by 162,000 as droughts have lengthened fire seasons. During Hurricane Sandy, the DOD helped distribute 6.2 million meals, 7.8 million gallons of fuel, medical supplies, and other staples.Indirect threatsDisplacement and civil unrestClimate change also affects food and water security, degrades the environment, increases the spread of diseases, and disrupts essential services like electricity production. These impacts can drive migration. One study found that if we continue our fossil fuel use trajectory, the probability of multiple simultaneous droughts could increase from the late 20th century average by 40 percent by 2050 and 60 percent by late century.These droughts could potentially affect 120 million people around the world, triggering crop failures, threatening water supplies, and forcing people to migrate. The World Bank has warned that 143 million people particularly in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America could end up migrating due to climate impacts.As migrants enter countries or regions unprepared to deal with them, tensions rise. As we already see on the U.S. southern border, migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Venezuela, and other nations fleeing poverty, violence, and extreme weather are causing enormous political turmoil.Climate impacts contribute to poverty, social inequality, political instability, and violence. Weak governments have trouble meeting their people's basic needs, so civil unrest increases. These conditions can lead to shifts in the regional balance of power or result in the failure of states. In some of these cases, the U.S. military may be called upon to come to the aid of its partners to restore stability.Joshua Fisher, director of the Advanced Consortium on Cooperation, Conflict, and Complexity at Columbia Climate School, said that most of the conflicts he sees in the world are not directly driven by climate change.""What climate change is doing is impacting already vulnerable societies,"" he said. ""So if there are tensions, if there are large sectors of the population who are marginalized, by and large those same sectors of society are going to be impacted disproportionately by climate change. This opens up a mechanism where climate change can further marginalize and harm already vulnerable people. And that can be the mechanism that leads to increased conflict.""Conflicts around decarbonizationAccording to aNational Intelligence Council report, tensions are also likely to grow as countries argue about how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Paris Agreement goals. The conflict will be about which countries bear more responsibility to act and to pay, due to their historic emissions.""As pressure to decarbonize increases, you can expect more animosity between the developed and developing worlds as poorer countries wonder, rightly so, why the richer countries, who have created the climate crisis in the first place, are now asking them to limit their consumption of fossil fuels,"" said Bordoff.Developing countries will continue to demand more money from developed countries, which have failed to mobilize the promised $100 billion a year by 2020. The UN estimates that developing countries will need at least $300 billion per year by 2030 just for adaptation. Meanwhile, countries that rely on fossil fuels to support their economies see theenergy transitionas a threat and are attempting to slow progress towards decarbonization.""The pressure of the energy transition may, if not managed carefully, increase geopolitical tensions, creating new risks to energy security,"" said Bordoff. ""Many of these tensions will be seen in who is wielding influence in the emerging clean energy economy, and who the winners and losers are in a shrinking fossil fuel economy.""Competition for resourcesEfforts to achieve decarbonization will hasten the race to secure resources. For instance, as countries try to reduce their own vulnerability by becoming greener and more energy self-sufficient, the demand for rare minerals for batteries and solar panels will increase. According to Bordoff, to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, the demand for critical minerals will go up sixfold. Competition between countries to acquire and process the minerals needed for renewable energy technologies could result in conflict.""One example of this is a recent rift in the U.S.-E.U. relationship, where we've seen historical allies at odds over perceived unfair protectionism in new clean energy investments,"" said Bordoff. ""Another is the heightened tensions between China and the West with regards to critical minerals, batteries, orsolar panels, with Western leaders concerned about China's dominance over the production of clean energy and the potential weaponization of this market dominance. The longer the world takes to get to net zero, the worse these problems will get.""The ArcticThe melting Arctic ice is opening up the Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.This could lead tocompetitionfor sea lanes for commercial shipping between the United States, Russia, China, and Canada. Countries are also vying for the region's unclaimed land, fish, natural gas, minerals, and other resources.Most legal matters in the region are determined by the Arctic Council, which is made up of the United States, Russia, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. Other countries, such as China, Germany, and India, are considered observer countries. Because the Arctic Council's resolutions are nonbinding, however, it has no enforcement power. Consequently, as military and commercial activity in the region grows, so too could the risk of miscalculation and conflict.GeoengineeringThe U.S. intelligence community is alsoincreasingly concernedabout geoengineering, which is now being discussed more often as a viable option for dealing with climate change. This is particularly the case with solar geoengineering, which involves sending reflective sulfur dioxide particles into the atmosphere to reflect solar radiation away from Earth and imitate the cooling effect of a volcanic eruption.Research on geoengineering is being done around the world, particularly in the United States, China, and India. As there is currently no international governance for geoengineering, it's conceivable that in the future, a single country suffering from climate impacts could decide to conduct geoengineering on its own. This could cause weather patterns around the world to shift, disrupt monsoons, degrade the ozone layer, or trigger droughts that affect agriculture; it could also be weaponized. This could exacerbate tensions between countries or even lead to war.What the military is doingIt is now DOD policy to consider climate change in all its operations, activities, business processes, decision making, and resource allocation to ensure that military forces continue to be capable and effective.The DOD isinvesting $3.6 billionto enhance the resilience of its infrastructure, improve its energy and water capacities, and modernize its operations.This includes funding for microgrids, energy storage, and renewable energy, electric vehicles, and charging installations. $106 million will be used to improve the energy efficiency of operations. $1.3 billion will be invested into research and development in cutting-edge technology and prototypes of new conveyances. $54 million will go toward incorporating climate impacts into war games and exercises to ensure that the military can operate in all conditions.""In a warming climate, you're going to see rising seas threaten critical infrastructure, growing geopolitical tensions, larger flows of migration away from the most climate-vulnerable nations, civil conflict driven by resource scarcity, and new venues for conflict,"" said Bordoff. ""Each one of these by themselves would be worrying, but having them play out simultaneously will cause not only a drain on limited resources to counteract them, but will exacerbate today's worsening geopolitical trends.""He added, ""Military leaders need to devote more attention to some of these more complex consequences of climate change so that they can better prepare for them.""The DOD is one of the only organizations in the world with the ability to move materials anywhere around the world in 24 hours, according to Fisher. ""And so understanding the national security interest we have in preventing conflicts from escalating into outright violence should be one of the DOD's priorities,"" he said.The DOD should look at areas that are vulnerable toclimatechange, as well as at near- and mid-term forecasts for risks in various regions. ""They should utilize the resources they have to prevent conflict, not with military action, but rather by supporting rule of law programs or emergency support, or providing provisions, to try to prevent conflicts from escalating.""Fisher has been impressed with the DOD's handling of the topic ofclimate change. ""The DOD has been able to be frank and sober about it, but understand that it is anational securitythreat, and treat it as such, rather than getting mired in the politics of it,"" he said. ""The more they can maintain that focus, the better I think they'll be.""Provided by State of the PlanetThis story is republished courtesy of Earth Institute, Columbia Universityhttp://blogs.ei.columbia.edu.Citation: Why climate change is a national security risk (2023, October 11) retrieved 3 November 2023 ","['us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'marshallislands', 'malaysia', 'guatemala', 'elsalvador', 'honduras', 'mexico', 'venezuela', 'china', 'china', 'china', 'china', 'china', 'russia', 'russia', 'canada', 'canada', 'finland', 'sweden', 'denmark', 'norway', 'iceland', 'germany', 'india', 'india']",gb,False,False

We often do not involve women in respondingto environmental problems. To often, we exclude them in discussions on solutions to climate crisis.Patriarchal culture also creates unequal gender relations, with women being considered only capable of managing household and domestic work.Leaving women out when coming up with environmental solutions puts them in more vulnerable positions.Whenclimate change-related events occurs—such as more extreme weather,forest firesor floods—women and girls bear aheavier burdenand experience more severe impacts.Violence against womenis also on the rise amid global warming.However, we need to changethe narrativethat women are merely ""victims"" of climate crisis.In reality, women in the Global South countries also possess the abilities and strength toprotect the environment. They manifest their power to preserve the environment in various actions, both formal and informal, individual and collective.Women's movements across the Global SouthHistorically, women have played a big part in protecting the environment in Asian and South American countries.One example is theChipko movement in Indiain the 1970s.The Chipko movement started in 1974, when the Indigenous women and community of Reni village in India fought to protect the forest from logging that threatened their livelihood. They collectively took action by guarding and embracing trees to push back contractors and prevent deforestation.Their fight went global,making waves worldwide.Duringthe 1985 Nairobi Conferenceon Women from Third World Countries, women emphasized the importance of nature conservation and women's environmental actions. Testimonies from the Chipko movement and similar women's movements in other countries were discussed at this conference.Fighting for change in Mexico and BoliviaBesides the Chipko movement, there is a recent example from women in Zapotalito, a village within the Chacahua-Pastoría lagoon national park area in southern Mexico.They have endured a series of environmental challenges, includingdead fish, a dreadful ammonia smell, and a decline in air and water quality due to adam project and lime oil factory pollution.The women of Zapotalito worked together toclean the natural canal in the Coaxaca mangrove area. They used shovels and hoes for regular clean-ups in 2016.Even as they fought for change, they continued their daily routines. They cooked food, made tortillas, cleaned houses, cared for children, tended to pets and plants and caught fish for their families to eat, even amid bad environmental conditions.On another front, the women's movementin Chiquiacá, Bolivia,has been protecting the Tariquía Flora and Fauna National Reserve since 2017 from oil and gas companies' expansion into their precious area.In a bold move in 2019, they actually blocked the entrance to the conservation area for a whopping five months to prevent drilling equipment from being brought in.Chiquiacá women in action in Bolivia.The women of Chiquiacá also took their protest to the streets, actively hindering any development on their land. What began as a local movement has grown into a powerful collective action that's still going strong today. It's gained the support of thousands of people in Bolivia.Indonesian fisherwomen's leadershipIn Indonesia, fisherwomen in Central Java have been working to sustain their community amidstthe climate change since 2020. Rising sea levels have increased flood risks in their neighborhoods, forcing them to take action by engaging with policymakers, raising awareness and fundraising to build bridges.Unfortunately, women in these movements often face threats, intimidation and violence. Their enemies tried to undermine their action, by saying ""women should stay silent at home and take care of the kitchen"" Some of them receiveddeath threats.Despite these challenges, however, they continue their fight to protect their land.Growing global recognitionThe stories above have shown women are capable of making a difference in environmental activism, from their homes and communities to the national stage.The global community increasingly recognizes their efforts too. Since the 1990s, more international policies haveemphasized genderas acrucial elementin nature conservation and sustainable development.For example, the 1992Rio Declaration on Environment and Developmentacknowledges the vital role of women in environmental management and development.The Beijing Platform for Action, established in 1995, is a resolution that supports gender equality and empowerment of women worldwide.The reportsof the High-Level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Beijing Platform for Action in Asia and the Pacific highlight the critical link between environmental change and women's roles as managers and providers of natural resources.There's also the 2004United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which emphasizes the crucial role of women in drought-affected areas, particularly in rural regions of developing countries.Recent documents fromthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)highlight the pivotal role of local women's movements and Indigenous women in shaping climate policies and actions.Numerous policies also promote women's participation in the sustainable development agenda.But, not all countries adopt those policies.Better solutions through involving womenDespite being disproportionately affected by environmental damages, women continue to demonstrate their resilience and knowledge in tackling climate change.To empower women's activism, governments worldwide should formulate policies integrating women's roles in conservation and sustainable development strategies within their own nations.As for the public, initiating efforts to document women's activism is crucial.Both government and public actions are essential to avoid oversimplifying women's experiences across diverse countries, and to move beyond the narrative that portrays them solely as victims.These actions are fundamental in steering clear of oversimplifying the experiences ofwomenacross diverse countries. They are also the first steps towards solvingenvironmental problemsinnew and better ways.","['not found', 'not found', 'india', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'ecuador', 'bolivia', 'bolivia', 'bolivia', 'indonesia']",gb,False,False

Rising temperatures, hail, and disease have taken their toll on the unique local grapes that make the region's delicate red wines and floral rakis which are traditionally distilled by the women rather than the men. Wines from the fiercely independent Catholic families of the mountains have fans as far away as the Vatican. But in the small village of Prosek, Gjon Barllokgjonaj has seen the fruits of his labour destroyed by the punishing heat this year. ""There's nothing left, I've lost everything,"" Barllokgjonaj told AFP. Most of the damage has been caused by a rash of mildew fuelled by a hot and stormy spring followed by excessively high temperatures and drought, killing off most of his grapes. With little to harvest, Barllokgjonaj is unable to produce any wine this year. Instead, the 69-year-old has been forced to buy grapes so his wife can make raki, a traditional brandy popular in Albania and much of southeast Europe. That made by the women of Mirdita is particularly admired for its precision and flair. Like Barllokgjonaj, many winemakers across northern Albania are struggling to adapt to a warmer world and all that comes with it. In the nearby Bukmira area Liza Ndoji tends just a single hectare of vines, producing a small amount of the prized ruby-coloured wine a year. But this year, all of his Kallmet grapes have withered. ""Nothing has ever been easy, but this year has been the worst,"" Ndoji, 70, told AFP. To make it worse, ""some areas have been hit by violent hailstorms"", said Elton Basha, a professor at the University of Agriculture in Tirana. ""Everything has become more complicated: water stress, frost, drought, disease,"" said Zef Ndoji, a winegrower from Bukmira, who has lost a third of his crop this year. ""Even though Albania enjoys a diversity of microclimates that are very favourable for vines"" because of its mountains and its position along the Adriatic Sea, it is also ""faced with new challenges"", said Professor Basha. Albania has some 11,000 hectares of vineyards, producing 190,000 to 195,000 tonnes of wine a year, according to official figures. ""The small farmers who account for a considerable proportion of grape production have not had the means to adapt."" Rigels Kacorri -- whose family cultivates 25.5 hectares of Kallmet grapes -- has been working for several years with more than 60 small winegrowers in the region to address the challenges. This year, he has focused his attention on vineyards that are around 600 metres above sea level, dotted with steel stakes that are more resistant to corrosion and able to withstand the humidity of the soil. He has also started to develop new technologies for monitoring plants and irrigation levels to withstand the harsher temperatures. Kacorri, however, is deeply opposed to planting genetically modified grape varieties designed to weather adverse growing conditions. For him and others, the natural Kallmet grape varieties famous in the region are reliable for providing ""the real taste"" of wine. ""Sometimes misfortune brings advantages,"" he told AFP. Elsewhere in Albania, others are considering growing their vines under glass to protect them from the elements. But many grape growers, like Ndoji, remain wary of such techniques. ""Wine made from grapes grown under glass can never have the aroma of friendship, which needs the sunlight of a natural environment.""","['albania', 'albania', 'albania', 'albania', 'albania', 'albania', 'albania', 'not found']",us,False,False

It's not raining the way it used to. So we use irrigation. Without that, we wouldn't get by,"" says Abade.To his right, he points to a barren field of withered grass that died before his cattle could eat it. To his left, he points to an exuberant patch of tall bluestem grass watered with a makeshift irrigation system, which he is counting on to keep his 15 cows—and himself—alive.He installed the system a year ago, digging a well and jerry-rigging a network of hoses.""Without irrigation, this whole place would look like that—dying of thirst,"" he says.""It takes technology to farm here.

The name ""Gilbues"" likely comes from an Indigenous word meaning ""fragile land,"" says environmental historian Dalton Macambira, of the Federal University of Piaui.But humans have made the problem worse by razing and burning vegetation whose roots helped secure the silty soil, and by over-taxing the environment as Gilbues has grown to a town of 11,000 people, he says.Gilbues was the scene of a diamond-mining rush in the mid-20th century, a sugarcane boom in the 1980s and is now one of the biggest soybean-producing counties in the state.""Where there are people, there's demand for natural resources,"" Macambira says.""That accelerates the problem, by demanding more of the environment than it can sustain.""Macambira published a study in January finding the area affected by desertification more than doubled from 387 square kilometers in 1976 to 805 (310 square miles) in 2019, hitting 15 counties and some 500 farming families.Several hundred determined farming families are hanging on in this desolate land of Gilbues, Brazil, scraping by with hardscrabble ingenuity and sounding the alarm over the spreading problem.Climate scientists say further studies are needed to pinpoint whether global warming is accelerating the phenomenon.Farmers say thedry seasonhas gotten drier, punctuated by a shorter, more-intense rainy season—which exacerbates the problem, asheavy rainswash away more soil, deepening the gaping canyons known as ""vocorocas.""Macambira says a hotter planet can only make things worse.""Wherever you haveenvironmental degradation, climate change tends to have a more perverse effect,"" he says.TurnaroundThe United Nations calls desertification a ""silent crisis"" that affects 500 million people worldwide, fueling poverty and conflicts.But there is opportunity in the problem, says Fabriciano Corado, president of conservation group SOS Gilbues.The 58-year-old agricultural engineer says although Gilbues's soil erodes easily, it is also a farmer's dream: rich in phosphorous and clay, it needs no fertilizer or other treatments.Several hundred determined farming families are hanging on in this desolate land of Gilbues, Brazil, scraping by with hardscrabble ingenuity and sounding the alarm over the spreading problem.Like Abade, he says farmers need technology to survive the encroaching desert—but nothing too high-tech.Local producers are getting extremely positive results with things like protectingnative vegetation, drip irrigation, fish farming and the ancient anti-erosion technique of terrace farming, he says.""We don't have to reinvent the wheel. The Aztecs, Incas and Mayas did it already,"" he says.He condemns the closure six years ago of a government-run anti-desertification research center in Gilbues that helped local farmers implement just such techniques.The state plans to reopen it—but has not set a date.The region meanwhile has huge potential as a solar energy producer, says Corado, citing the recent opening of a 2.2-million-panel solar park.

The carcasses of 120 river dolphins have been found floating in a tributary of the Amazon River in Brazil over the last week in circumstances that experts suspect were caused by severe drought and heat. The Mamiraua Institute, a research group at Brazil’s Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, said two more dead dolphins were found on Monday in the region around Tefe Lake. Experts believe high water temperatures are the most likely cause of the deaths as temperatures since last week have exceeded 39C (102F) in the Tefe Lake region. Thousands offish have also died, local media reported. “We have documented 120 carcasses in the last week,” said Miriam Marmontel, a researcher at the Mamiraua Institute. Amazon river dolphins, many of a striking pink colour, are a unique freshwater species found only in therivers of South Americaand are one of a handful of freshwater dolphin species left in the world. Slow reproductive cycles make their populations especially vulnerable to threats. Marmontel said roughly eight of every 10 carcasses being found are pink dolphins, which are called “boto” in Brazil, and could represent 10 percent of their estimated population in Lake Tefe. “Ten percent is a very high percentage of loss, and the possibility that it will increase could threaten the survival of the species in Lake Tefe,” Marmontel said. The boto and thegrey river dolphincalled the “tucuxi” are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’sred list of threatened species. Brazil’s Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation has rushed veterinarians and aquatic mammal experts to rescue dolphins still alive in the lake. The scientists do not know with certainty that drought and heat are to blame for the spike in dolphin mortality. They are working to rule out other causes, such as a bacterial infection that could have killed the dolphins. But at least 70 of the carcasses surfaced late last week when the temperature of Lake Tefe’s water reached 39C, more than 10 degrees higher than the average for this time of the year. The water temperature declined for a few days but rose again on Sunday to 37C (99 F), worried experts said. Environmental activists have blamed the unusually hot conditions on climate change, which makes droughts and heat waves more likely and severe. Ayan Fleischmann, the geospatial coordinator at the Mamiraua Institute, said the drought has had a significant impact on the riverside communities in the Amazon region. “Many communities are becoming isolated, without access to good quality water, without access to the river, which is their main means of transportation,” he said. Nicson Marreira, mayor of Tefe, a city of 60,000 residents, said his government was unable to deliver food directly to some isolated communities because the rivers are dry.

(NASDAQ: ERII) today announced several contracts to supply the PX® Pressure Exchanger® (“PX”) to desalination projects in Algeria totaling over $28 million. Desalination plays a large role in Algeria’s strategy to combat water scarcity. Desalination provides 17% of Algeria’s water, and the country has prioritized increasing desalination’s share to 50% of the water supply by 2030, in response to climate change and a severe drought in 2021. Algeria’s commitment to desalination is evident in its water strategy, which includes the creation of a dedicated desalination agency. This slate of projects will help bring the country closer to its goal, as all of these contracted projects will supply PX devices to municipal desalination projects, providing clean drinking water to local residents. All orders are scheduled to deliver in 2023. “Algeria is a clear example of why desalination will continue to be a critical part of a diversified water supply strategy in the face of water scarcity around the world,” said Rodney Clemente, Energy Recovery Senior Vice President of Water. “While Algeria has also invested in reuse, conservation, and the construction of dams to increase water capacity, seawater desalination remains the only drought-proof source. With these new awards, we will have nearly 3.5 million cubic meters per day of installed capacity within the country. Customers around the world continue to rely on the PX to be able to meet their water demand while optimizing their operational costs.” The PX can reduce energy consumption in desalination by as much as 60% and offers the lowest lifecycle cost of any energy recovery device on the market. Energy Recovery estimates that these PX units will prevent more than 560,000 metric tons of carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere each year, the equivalent of removing approximately 120,000 passenger cars from the road.

US President Joe Biden said he awarded Mr Ejeta the medal for his ""outstanding contributions to the science of plant genetics"". Mr Ejeta is acclaimed as one of the world's leading plant geneticists. He specialises in the study of sorghum, a popular source of food in Africa. In 2009, Mr Ejeta won the prestigious World Food Prize for developing a sorghum hybrid that is resistant to both drought and the parasitic weed Striga, which commonly invades farms in Africa. Sorghum is the fifth-most important cereal crop globally - after maize, wheat, rice and barley. It is also the second-most important cereal in Africa and has been embraced as a staple by several countries on the continent, particularly those prone to drought. Mr Ejeta was raised in a single-roomed thatched home in a village in central Ethiopia not far from the capital, Addis Ababa. However, he had limited access to school and had to travel 20km (12 miles) to a nearby town to attend lessons, only returning home at weekends. His childhood, which was plagued by hunger and food scarcity, has heavily influenced his scientific research over the years, fuelling him in his pursuit to improve food security. He mentioned experiencing hunger as a child in one of his interviews with the BBC. ""When I went to school away from home invariably I was hungry. In fact recalling grade school, I can count the number of days where I had breakfast."" He added that going to school in the morning ""with an empty stomach is a challenge. So I have experienced hunger on a regular basis"". The president of Purdue University in the US state of Indiana, where Mr Ejeta works as a professor and leads global food security programmes, celebrated the award, hailing Mr Ejeta as ""a role model of perseverance"" and ""one of the most impactful geneticists in the world"". ""Our university celebrates another prestigious and richly deserved honour,"" said Purdue University president Mung Chiang. Mr Ejeta, who holds American nationality, was one of nine leading US scientists awarded at the White House by President Biden on Tuesday. ""By developing sorghum strains that withstand droughts and parasites, he has improved food security for millions,"" President Biden said at the award ceremony. ""His advocacy for science, policy, and institutions as key to economic development has lifted the fortunes of farmers and strengthened the souls of nations,"" he added. The National Medal of Science has been awarded by US presidents since 1959 to ""individuals deserving of special recognition for their outstanding contributions"" in various science-related fields. Mr Ejeta also received the National Hero Award from the Ethiopian government shortly after he won the World Food Prize in 2009, the highest national honour bestowed on Ethiopian citizens. He was also appointed to the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development in 2011 by then US President Barack Obama.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'spain', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia']",gb,False,False

But a new study from SMU fire scientist Christopher Roos published in the journalNature Ecology & Evolutionshows that climate is an undervalued part of the equation.Roos, SMU environmental archaeologist and professor of anthropology, traveled with his team to the Sigatoka River valley in southwestern Fiji in 2013, where they collected charcoal and stable carbon isotopes from deep soil cores to understand historic patterns of fire activity in the area. Different plants have distinct carbon isotopic signatures, which can provide information about past plant communities.The team found fires and fire-createdgrassy areasthat predatehuman settlementby millennia and actively corresponded to droughts likely driven by a regularly occurring weather pattern known as El Niño. El Niño events can alter precipitation patterns worldwide, makingenvironmental conditionsmore favorable for wildfires. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued an El Niño advisory in June, announcing the latest arrival of theclimateevent that continues to influence weather worldwide.Lighting strikes also act as a natural cause of wildfires, igniting plant material that acts as fuel.The impact of human settlement, farming activity (particularly the clearing and burning of land) and resulting deforestation of remote Pacific islands is well established in the scientific record, and research from the Roos team only confirms what Roos calls ""a modern environmental parable."" But the impact of climate must be considered, too, the study finds.""It struck me that these fires are not exclusively human-driven, because when I looked at earlier pre-human spikes in fire activity, those lined up with El Niños,"" said Roos. ""The combination of climate andhuman activitydrives island deforestation and increases wildfire activity. It may be that human activity is making the landscape more sensitive to those climate variations. But, it could also be that the climate is making the landscape more sensitive to human activity.""In the past, Roos said, research often focused more on human activity harming Pacific Islands' land without considering climate's role in the damage. He believes an approach that considers both causes is necessary, especially with catastrophic wildfire events occurring more regularly.Roos also points out that the Pacific Islands are natural laboratories to study the grass-fire cycle, which is prevalent in areas where wildfire is occurring with the spread of invasive grasses. Traditional farmers have practiced successful techniques for clearing and burning land for centuries, and past lessons could offer ways to prepare and cope with future wildfire events. Roos stresses that we must adapt to the new environment climate and humans have created.""Droughts triggered by El Niño events appear to have played a role in intensifying the grass-fire cycle and contributing to deforestation in the past,"" he said.

These reservoirs providedpotable waterfor thousands to tens of thousands of people in cities during the annual, five-month dry season and in periods of prolonged drought.""Most major southern lowland Maya cities emerged in areas that lackedsurface waterbut had great agricultural soils,"" Lucero said. ""They compensated by constructingreservoirsystems that started small and grew in size and complexity.""Over time, the Maya built canals, dams, sluices and berms to direct, store and transport water. They used quartz sand for water filtration, sometimes importing it from great distances to massive cities like Tikal in what is now northern Guatemala. Asediment corefrom one of Tikal's reservoirs also found that zeolite sand had been used in its construction.Previous studies have shown that this volcanic sand can filter impurities and disease-causing microbes from water. The zeolite also would have been imported from sources about 18 miles (30 kilometers) away.""Tikal's reservoirs could hold more than 900,000 cubic meters of water,"" Lucero wrote. Estimates suggest that up to 80,000 people lived in the city and its environs in the Late Classic period, roughly 600 to 800 C.E. The reservoirs kept people and crops hydrated during the dry season, Lucero said.Maya royalty got much of their status from their ability to provide water to the populace.""Clean water andpolitical powerwere inextricably linked—as demonstrated by the fact that the largest reservoirs were built near palaces and temples,"" Lucero wrote. The kings also performed ceremonies to gain the favor of ancestors and the rain god, Chahk.A key challenge was to keep standing water in reservoirs from becoming stagnant and undrinkable, and for that the Maya likely relied on aquatic plants, many of which still populate Central American wetlands today, Lucero said. These include cattails, sedges, reeds and others. Some of these plants have been identified in sediment cores from Maya reservoirs.These plants filtered the water, reducing murkiness and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorous, Lucero said.""The Maya would have had to dredge every several years… (and) harvest and replenish aquatic plants,"" she wrote. The nutrient-laden soils and plants removed from reservoirs could then be used to fertilize urban fields and gardens.The most iconic aquatic plant associated with the ancient Maya is thewater lily, Nymphaea ampla, which thrives only inclean water, Lucero said. Its pollen has been found insediment coresfrom several Maya reservoirs. Water lilies symbolized ""Classic Maya kingship,"" Lucero wrote.""The kings even donned headdresses adorned with the flowers and are depicted with water lilies in Maya art,"" Lucero said.""Water lilies do not tolerateacidic conditionsor too much calcium such as limestone or high concentrations of certain minerals like iron and manganese,"" she wrote.To keep water lilies alive, water managers would have had to line the reservoirs with clay, Lucero said. A layer of sediment would be needed for plants' roots. In turn, thewater liliesand trees and shrubs planted near the reservoirs shaded the water, cooling it and inhibiting the growth of algae.""The Maya generally did not build residences near reservoir edges, so contamination seeping through the karstic terrain would not have been an issue,"" Lucero wrote.The evidence gathered from several southern lowland cities indicates that, as constructed wetlands, Maya reservoirs supplied potable water to people for more than 1,000 years, failing only when the severest droughts took hold in the region between 800 and 900 C.E., Lucero said. She notes that current climate trends will require many of the same approaches the Maya employed, including the use ofaquatic plantsto improve and maintain water quality naturally.Maya vessel (c. 700–800 CE) from Guatemala depicting a king sitting on a throne wearing a water lily headdress.

""They provide an economical, low technology, less expensive and high energy-saving treatment technology.""In addition to providing clean water, constructed wetlands also support aquatic animals and can be a source of nutrients to replenish agricultural soils, she wrote.""The next step moving forward is to combine our respective expertise and implement the lessons embodied in ancient Maya reservoirs in conjunction with what is currently known about constructed wetlands,"" she wrote.","['guatemala', 'guatemala', 'not found', 'mexico', 'mexico']",gb,False,False

Economic growth is expected to slow this year in the resource-rich nation as exports slump on falling commodity prices and weakening global trade, while staples such as rice become more expensive for Indonesians grappling with drought. In a statement, the presidential office said the government would scrap the value added tax (VAT) of 11 per cent on purchases of homes worth less than 2 billion rupiah ($126,000) until June 2024, after which it will be halved for an unspecified time. The government will also extend by a month to December its programme of distributing rice to more than 21 million lower-income households, it added, an effort meant to shield against rising prices of the staple. Speaking to investors at a seminar earlier on Tuesday, Jokowi, as the president is popularly known, warned of the potential for oil prices to soar due to escalating conflict in the Middle East and capital outflows linked to U.S. monetary tightening, which could affect Indonesia's economy. ""If we see the percentage of the depreciation of our currency, it's still safe for the real sector, safe for the financial sector, as well as for inflation,"" he said. The rupiah has dropped by as much as 4.7 per cent from a peak in early September, pressured by risk-off sentiment among investors, and leading Indonesia's central bank to unexpectedly raise interest rates last week. Some economists say more hikes are likely if the slide continues. Although the currency strengthened as much as 0.66 per cent on Tuesday to trade at 15,825 against the dollar, it stayed near its weakest levels since 2020. ""We have to be calculative and prepare for the long run,"" the president said. He added that his national budget had the endurance to withstand shocks until 2024, as the finance ministry held cash of 616 trillion rupiah ($38.84 billion) by Oct. 13. The government plans cash transfers to millions of homes to cope with rising food prices, media said, citing chief economic affairs minister Airlangga Hartarto. However, a ministry spokesperson did not respond to a request for confirmation. Prices of key food items such as rice, sugar and chili have risen as drought shrivels harvests in Indonesia in the year of an El Nino weather pattern, even though headline inflation remains low.

Five generations of crosses result in cattle capable of producing 10 liters of milk per day under typical Tanzanian management, blasting past the half-liter average yield of indigenous cattle.After breeding the first of these calves in the U.S., project leader Matt Wheeler, professor in the Department of Animal Sciences in the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences (ACES) at Illinois, is ready to bring embryos to Tanzania.""High-yielding Girolandos—Holstein-Gyr crosses—are common in Brazil, but because of endemic diseases there, those cattle can't be exported to most other countries,"" Wheeler said. ""We wanted to develop a high health-status herd in the U.S. so we could export their genetics anywhere in the world.""Wheeler's team plans to implant 100 half-blood Holstein-Gyr or Jersey-Gyr embryos into indigenous cattle in two Tanzanian locations this March. The resulting calves will be inseminated through successive generations to create ""pure synthetic"" cattle with five-eighths Holstein or Jersey and three-eighths Gyr genetics. Unlike Girolandos, Jersey-Gyr pure synthetics do not yet have an official name.Pure synthetics are worth the time and effort; once the five-eighths/three-eighths genetics are established, they're locked in. In other words, calves from successive matings will maintain the same genetic ratio.""The whole idea is to keep the disease and pest resistance linked together with the milk production so that as you breed, those traits don't separate,"" Wheeler said. ""That's going to be the challenge in developing countries; until you get to the pure synthetic generation, there will always be the temptation to breed to the bull down the road, losing the effect.""Wheeler's team, including co-author Moses Ole-Neselle of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), cares about getting this effort right. Although developing the embryos took years of meticulous work, they're not stopping there. The team hosted its first online course on bovine assisted reproduction technology last summer, including 12 participants from Tanzania. And there's more to come.""It was important to start training the first group of veterinarians and graduate students to adopt the technology, so when we get there, it's not a foreign thing,"" Wheeler said. ""The Tanzanian government wants this training and student exchanges. We're going to continue investing in this program for as long as it takes.""Wheeler recognizes the best genetics and most comprehensive training won't amount to much if the plan doesn't account for the local culture. With advice from collaborators like the Tanzania Livestock Research Institute and Teresa Barnes, director of the Center for African Studies at Illinois, Wheeler has already adjusted his strategy to accommodate the preferences of local Maasai herdsmen.""We've learned some Maasai clans strongly prefer smaller, red cattle, so the Holstein crosses we made initially, which were large and black, weren't going to work,"" he said. ""I had to start over with Jerseys, which set us back a bit. It will be worth it if they're better accepted.""But some aspects of Tanzanian cattle management will have to change to realize the full potential of the improved genetics. For example, Wheeler said nomadic Maasai herders often graze cattle 25 miles from their enclosures each day, limiting the energy available for milk production.While the project is still in its early stages, it represents a step toward more climate-resilient animal agriculture, the topic of the special issue ofAnimal Frontiersin which Wheeler's article is published. While Wheeler's current priority is to bolster food security in the Global South whereclimate changeis hitting hardest, he said the same technology could be used to protect cattle from changing climates here in the U.S. and around the world. In other words, tropical genetics could be inserted into our already high-yielding cattle to better withstand heat, drought, and disease.""These cattle would work very well in Mexico, Texas, New Mexico, and California. Maybe it's time to start thinking about that now,"" Wheeler said. ""People don't usually think that far ahead, but my prediction is that people are going to look back and realize having tropical genetics earlier would have been a good thing.""","['tanzania', 'tanzania', 'tanzania', 'denmark', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'brazil', 'germany', 'germany', 'jersey', 'mexico']",gb,False,False

New Orleans, Louisiana –On a thin strip of land that winds along the Mississippi River, crabber James Kim gently touches his last surviving orange tree. It’s a warm, clear October afternoon, but the tree’s fruit is marred by soft green spots. “We planted 20 of them,” says Kim, gesturing behind him to the empty row where trees once stood at the back of his garden. For about eight years, he says, they bore good oranges. “Then, later on, the weather changed. Everything salty, salty. And they all died.” Since June, seawater from the Gulf of Mexico has nosed up theMississippi River, helped byextreme droughtandsea level rise. In Louisiana’s lower Plaquemines Parish, where Kim lives, this saltwater intrusion has sparked a crisis. For months, more than 9,000 residents have been left without safe drinking water. And while parish officials say the water is now potable again — thanks to the recent installation of reverse osmosis machinery — in the river, the salt remains. The parish’s proximity to wetlands and the Gulf means it is acutely vulnerable to climate change. Plaquemines Parish could losemore than half its land areaover the next 45 years, as the seas rise and the marshes erode. And while the crabs are happy enough in the saltier river, saltwater intrusion threatens to squeeze an industry already facing collapse. The small towns here comprise one of the United States’ largest seafood ports. But just last month, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards requested an emergency declaration for shrimpers struggling in the face of imports and plummeting prices. Now, the advancing saltwater is transforming thecoastal environment, burning the roots of cypress trees and pushing freshwater species upstream, disrupting local fisheries. The problem of salt is not entirely new: Kim’s garden mostly died amid saltwater intrusion issues in 2021. But this year, the seawater has come further and stayed much longer than usual. “When there’s no salt and the weather is good,” Kim says, “normally, it’s paradise”. Kim arrived in the US from Cambodia in 1989. At first, he hopped around the country chasing work — travelling from Alabama to Massachusetts, where he and his wife, Karen Suon, processed sea urchins — before settling in Louisiana in 2005. Kim and Suon are the only two employees of J&K World Trade, a company that processes crabs to sell to wholesalers and factories. They work “seven days a week”, says Suon, cleaning and sorting thousands of crabs that fishers haul in from the wetlands nearby. When a refrigeration truck pulls up, Suon, dressed in white shrimper boots and a floppy wide-brimmed hat, pulls a pallet jack into their giant industrial cooler. She emerges with two dozen bushels of live blue crabs, who sleepily poke their pincers through the boxes’ holes. Kim drives a small forklift to load the crab boxes into the back of the waiting truck so they can be transported to wholesalers. But he pauses to point to a large splotch of reddish brown on his forklift: rust. “We ordered a new one,” Kim shouts over the noise of idling engines. The machinery here typically rusts due to the salt in the air, a normal phenomenon for the coastal parish. But lately, the rust has accelerated dramatically. The replacement will cost the couple about $43,000, says Suon, laughing as she winces. Machines can be replaced. But as salt increasingly pushes upriver, it is also killing plants across the parish. “All the plants and everything [are] gone,” Kim says. Kim walks back towards his garden, a collection of coops and planters he built himself from wood and aluminium siding. He plucks fragrant leaves from Thai basil and tarragon, pointing out passionfruit and grape vines and bitter melons. He also grows several different plants used to make traditional Cambodian medicine, to ward off illness and increase circulation. He also has over 100 chickens: It gets lonely down here, he jokes, as they peck at the empty crab shells. He freely shares the bounty from his harvests — fruit, eggs, meat, medicine — with his neighbours. The community here is close-knit. But in recent years, he has less to share. The garden used to be much bigger, he explains, but salt killed most of his plants. During the hot Louisiana summer, he had to purchase the five gallons (19 litres) of freshwater his chickens needed each day. At Ditcharo Seafood in Buras, part of the Plaquemines Parish, dock manager Mike Berthalot opens an enormous metal cabinet and points inside. There, water runs over huge tubes of freon. Suddenly, before Berthalot’s eyes, the water blooms white with ice, freezes and finally sloughs off in a clatter, falling into an enormous metal container in the dock below. But something is wrong with Berthalot’s ice machines. At the top, the tubes are turning yellow. Berthalot says that’s due to salt. “It’s really messing everything up.” These million-dollar machines are crucial for the shrimp docks, which use massive caches of ice to fill boat holds and cool the nearly 226,796 kilogrammes (500,000 pounds) of shrimp the dock receives each day. And water valves are breaking, too. “We buy them brand-new, and they’re only lasting not even two months,” Berthalot says. “Every one of them’s gone bad on me.” Berthalot, a flurry of hectic activity who speaks with gruff warmth, is a self-taught repairman. He’s worked these docks for over 45 years. Some repairs, he can handle, but for major breaks, his company needs to fly in a specialist from Georgia — a burdensome expense. A few weeks ago, Berthalot says, they had to spend $20,000 on repairs. He’s never seen ice machines have issues like this, he adds. Since July, the machines have been producing about half of what they should, forcing the company to buy ice out of pocket. Derek Ditcharo, the owner’s brother, estimates the company has spent $50,000 on ice due to problems with the machines. Many workers at the Ditcharo dock are, like Kim, East Asian. Sandy Nguyen of Coastal Communities Consulting, a language access group for Asian fishers, estimates that 50 to 60 percent of people in lower Plaquemines are East Asian, primarily Vietnamese and Cambodian. “The saltwater intrusion has impacted them a lot,” says Nguyen. “It’s really bad.” And as the sea-level rise accelerates and weather events grow more extreme, saltwater intrusion is expected to worsen in future years. Already, the smaller, more vulnerable farmers and fishers are feeling the brunt of the problem, with fewer resources to adapt to the saltier environment. Fifty miles upriver in Belle Chasse, just past the farthest reach of the saltwater, Ricky Becnel, one of the country’s leading citrus producers, pauses his Gator utility vehicle at the top of a levee. On one side sprawl 10,000 fruit trees: acres of red pineapple, persimmons, olives and figs. On the other side, a pipe plunges down into the river, sucking up 120,000 gallons (450,000 litres) per day, to be filtered through an automated $50,000 irrigation system. Becnel got the system 21 years ago, when he faced “a similar situation — not quite this severe”. The filter doesn’t remove salt, but so far he’s OK. The salt here isn’t as bad as down in Boothville, the community where Kim lives. In fact, from the levee, Becnel can see ships dredging river mud to build an underwater sill, meant to hold back the salt. The US Army Corps of Engineers is leading the project, part of a multi-pronged effort to address the threat. Currently, the Army Corps predicts that the salt will reach Becnel’s farm in November. But Kim fears the parish is not adequately planning for a long-term solution. He has considered digging his own well. It would cost up to $4,000 but would be sufficient to water his crops, since he has a much smaller operation than Becnel. Kim, however, doesn’t think the parish will give him a permit to dig it. For now, he and Suan are still getting bottled water from the nearby fire station for drinking and cooking. And the dragon fruit, at least, are still growing strong. He points out the bright-green cactus they grow on, which he’s nursed on blue crab shells, crushed up and mounded around the plant’s base once a year. The crab shells help the last of his dragon fruit trees grow “quick and all natural and very sweet”, he says proudly. “Very sweet.” Follow Al Jazeera English:","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'cambodia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'georgia', 'unitedkingdom', 'colombia']",us,True,True

The Roman Empire fell more than 1,500 years ago, but its grip on the popular imagination is still strong, as evidenced by a recent trend on TikTok. Women started filming the men in their lives to document their answers to a simple question: How often do you think about the Roman Empire? “I guess, technically, like every day,”one boyfriend said, as his girlfriend wheezed out an astonished “What?” He wasn’t the only one, as an avalanche of Twitter posts, Instagram Reels, and news articles made clear. Whiledriving on a highway, some men couldn’t help but think about the extensive network of roads the Romans built, some of which arestill in use today. Theyponderedthe system of aqueducts, built with concrete that could harden underwater. There are a lot of reasons why people are fascinated by the rise and fall of ancient empires, gender dynamics aside. Part of what’s driving that interest is the question: How could something so big and so advanced fail? And, more pressingly: Could something similar happen to us? Between rampaging wildfires, arise in political violence, and the public’strust in government at record lows, it doesn’t seem so far-fetched that America could go up in smoke. Theories of breakdown driven by climate change have proliferated in recent years, encouraged by the likes of Jared Diamond’s 2005 bookCollapse:How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. The Roman Empire, for example,unraveled during a spasm of volcanic explosions, which led to a period of cooling that precipitated the first pandemic of bubonic plague. The decline of the ancient Maya in Central America has been linked with a major drought. Angkor Wat’s downfall, in what is now Cambodia, has been pinned on a period ofwild swingsbetween drought and monsoon floods. So if minor forms of climate change spelled the collapse of these great societies, how are we supposed to survive the much more radical shifts of today? Focusing too closely on catastrophe can result in a skewed view of the past—it overlooks societies that navigated an environmental disaster and made it through intact. Areview of the literaturein 2021 found that 77 percent of studies analyzing the interplay between climate change and societies emphasized catastrophe, while only 10 percent focused on resilience. Historians, anthropologists, andarchaeologistshave recently tried to fill in that gap. The latest entry is a study that analyzes 150 crises from different time periods and regions, going offa comprehensive data setthat covers more than 5,000 years of human history, back to the Neolithic period. Environmental forces often play a critical role in the fall of societies, the study found, but they can’t do it alone. Angela Watercutter Jim Morrison Matt Simon Researchers with the Complexity Science Hub, an organization based in Vienna, Austria, that uses mathematical models to understand the dynamics of complex systems, found plenty of examples of societies that made it through famines, cold snaps, and other forms of environmental stress. Several Mesoamerican cities, including the Zapotec settlements of Mitla and Yagul in modern-day Oaxaca, “not only survived but thrived within the same drought conditions” that contributed to the fall of the Maya civilization in the 8th century. And the Maya, before that point, had weatheredfive earlier droughtsand continued to grow. Thenew research, published in a peer-reviewed biological sciences journal from The Royal Society last month, suggests that resilience is an ability that societies can gain and lose over time. Researchers found that a stable society can withstand even a dramatic climate shock, whereas a small shock can lead to chaos in a vulnerable one.","['unitedkingdom', 'not found', 'not found', 'unitedstates', 'cambodia', 'nigeria', 'austria', 'austria', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico']",us,True,False

But across five continents this year, it's also unleashed a different kind of disaster: deadly flooding.Cities around the world have seen record rainfall 139 times in 2023. A rare hurricane-like storm inundated Libya last month, killing thousands. More than 100 people died across Asia during an intense monsoon season in July. After fatal floods pummeled the U.S. Northeast over the summer,torrential rainsparalyzed New York City last week.Soaring temperatures were at the root of all these weather calamities. June, July and August were the hottest ever for that period. Higher air temperatures mean the atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall, while record-hot oceans provide fuel for storms. And as the climate warms, flooding is poised to get worse.""We are now seeing record-smashing ocean temperatures, record-smashing global temperatures and record-smashing floods,"" said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center. ""It's all connected.""In the U.S., two major flood events this year—in California from January to March and the Northeast in July—killed 32 people and caused $6.7 billion in damages, according to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information. The damages are the highest since 2019, when accounting only for flood incidents totaling more than $1 billion.Global damages are difficult to tally because not all countries keep accurate records, but flood events have left more than 17,000 people dead or missing in 2023. On average, there were 216 floods or landslides worldwide per year from 2019 to 2022, compared with an average of 160 over the previous four years, according to the International Disaster Database.In large part, the ever-worsening downpours are caused by what scientists call a ""positive feedback loop.""It works like this: The Earth's temperature rises in response to greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Hotter air holds morewater vapor, which then absorbs heat and prevents it from escaping the atmosphere—resulting in even more moisture in the air and heavier rainfall.Water vapor ""traps yet more heat and sets up a vicious cycle,"" Francis said.As the atmosphere gets warmer, so have the world's oceans. Higher water temperatures heat up the air above the sea surface, generating energy for hurricanes andtropical stormsto form. The Atlantic saw 10 storms develop from Aug. 20 to Sept. 16, the most on record for that period, according to Phil Klotzbach, a Colorado State University hurricane researcher.The storm that devastated Libya last month was a ""medicane,"" a name that's an amalgamation of Mediterranean and hurricane. Theseweather systemsare smaller than large Atlantic storms but can strike with Category 1 force on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, bringing winds greater than 74 miles per hour and flooding rains.Warmer water temperatures lead ""to a lot of evaporation from the oceans and more moisture in the atmosphere, and that provides the fuel for more rainfall in general,"" said Robert Adler, a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland. ""There is not much doubt that global warming in general is pushing us toward more intense rainfall events.""The total amount of rain that falls on Earth has only increased a small amount as the climate evolves, but what's changed is the intensity, Alder said.In the past, a hypothetical city may have seen 10 storms per month, each bringing an inch of rain. Now, a singlestormcan drop 10 inches of rain, overwhelming streets, drains and buildings that weren't constructed to handle that kind of deluge.""All the storms today can tap into that extra moisture, produce more rain, and increase the chances of flooding,"" Francis said. ""Water vapor is rocket fuel for storms—more of it means they can strengthen faster and become more intense.""Amplifying ocean heat this year is the weather pattern know as El Niño, which warms the equatorial Pacific's surface.Of course, this year's extreme weather hasn't been confined to flooding: Much of the world remains under dry conditions. A massive heat wave taxed energy grids across Texas and Mexico over the summer, throwing the U.S. Great Plains and Midwest deep into drought. But the increased frequency of both drought and flooding is evidence of global warming, said Lou Gritzo, chief science officer and staff senior vice president at commercial property insurer FM Global.""These things are not unrelated,"" Gritzo said. ""We are seeing exactly what we would expect to see in a changing climate.""How people use the land also can affect the severity of floods, said Deborah Brosnan, a climate scientist and founder of environmental risk consultancy Deborah Brosnan & Associates.In Libya, deforestation, unhealthy or depleted soil and poorly maintained dams all helped turn an extreme weather event into a human catastrophe, Brosnan said.But the risks aren't confined to developing nations. Climate change combined with urbanization all over the globe means higher rainfall, more pavement and fewer places for all that water to go when it hits the ground.""There is no area that is immune to this,"" Gritzo said.

But extreme weather blamed on climate change has ruined his harvest.""Production has fallen by 80 percent,"" said the 43-year-old farmer from Sabina, north of Rome, despondently holding up a branch with only a few shriveled green and black olives on it.Known since Roman times for itsolive groves, this region boasts trees said to be hundreds, even thousands, of years old.But changing weather patterns are proving hugely challenging.""For several years, our land has really suffered fromclimate change,"" Risolo told AFP, citing torrential rain contrasted with ""long periods of heat lasting into the autumn"".Normally, he and his workers would be in coats for the autumn harvest, when they use electric devices to shake the trees so the fruit falls onto tarpaulins below.Earlier this week they were collecting the olives while wearing T-shirts, as the thermostat hit 29 degrees Celsius (84 degrees Fahrenheit).The cut in production has affected not just Sabina, but most of the central and northern regions of Italy, the world's second-largest producer ofolive oilafter Spain.This year national production is estimated to be 290,000 metric tons, down from 315,000 in 2022 and the lowest figure in the last four years, according to agricultural association Coldiretti.The Sabina region has been known for its olive groves since Roman times, some of the trees here said to be hundreds, even thousands, of years old.More uncertain than everWhen harvested, Risolo's olives go to the ""OP Latium"" mill, where they and others from the area are washed, sorted and then crushed into a greenish paste from which the precious extra virgin oil is extracted.The smell is glorious, and the equipment is state-of-the-art. But all the technology in the world cannot squeeze oil from olives that don't exist.Agronomist Stefano Cifeca, who is responsible forquality controlon site, confirmed this year's meager harvest.""Unfortunately this year climate change meant that in April and May (the flowering months)... we hadheavy rainfallthat washed away the pollen,"" hindering fertilization and the development of olives, he said.Faced with increasingly hot summers and long periods without rain, Unaprol, the national association of olive oil producers, is calling for a national plan to help save water.Cifeca backs this idea at a local level, urging the creation of basins to collect water in winter that can then be reused when drought hits.Changing weather patterns are proving hugely challenging.Farmers here are used to tough times. In 2018, Risolo recalls, a frost wiped out his harvest.But he warned that agriculture faces ""a more uncertain future than ever, because we cannot accurately predict these changes in the climate"".Saved by the southThe stakes are high. Italy has 150 millionolive treesrepresenting three billion euros ($3.19 billion) in annual turnover and supporting 400,000 businesses, according to Coldiretti.The risk is that some farmers switch to other crops, although Cifeca insists this is not yet necessary.""Luckily the olive tree is a very robust plant that can adapt to changes in climate and different territories,"" he said.Despite thepoor performancein the center and north, Italian production this year was saved by its southern regions, both Puglia—which makes half of Italy's oil—and Calabria.Olives are processed to make olive oil at a mill in Palombara Sabina, Lazio.Farmers have also been helped by rising prices in theglobal marketfor olive oil, as production in Spain, which normally produces half of the world's supply, has also suffered.Production in Spain fell 34 percent compared to the average over the last four years, according to Coldiretti figures from September, due to a prolonged drought.But the rising prices are bad news for consumers—including in Italy, which consumes 15 percent of olive oil produced worldwide.","['italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'unitedstates', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'ukraine']",gb,False,False

French cheesemakers toldThe New York Timesthat climate change is impacting their ability to follow traditional methods for quality cheeses, including some of the 46 cheeses that carry the prestigious AOP label, which stands for ""Appellation d'Origine Protégée"" or ""Protected Designation of Origin."" Cheeses that carry an AOP label, such as Camembert de Normandie and Roquefort, have to meet certain standards and quality levels. Those standards can cover every stage of the cheesemaking process, from the breeds of animals producing the milk to what those animals eat and when they can graze. Now some cheesemakers are arguing those rules may need to be changed, as hotter and drier summers are killing some pastures. ""The whole system was built on the fact that we had certain cereals and hay available — all the rules were written with that in mind,"" Simon Bouchet, from the association for theFrenchgoat cheese Picodon, told the outlet. ""But with climate change and droughts, all that has been called into question."" The Times reported that the standards for one specific type of French cheese required cows to graze on a mountain pasture for seven months. However, there was no longer enough grass, so the cheesemakers stopped producing the cheese altogether. After a heatwave last year, some cheese associations got permission from the regulatory body to break from the rules. Other cheesemakers are experimenting to see how they can produce the same quality product and still meet the traditional rules, despite changes in the environment. ""We are studying all the aspects of cheesability,"" one cheesemaker working on an experimental goat farm told the Times. The farm, led by cheesemakers, is seeing if they can get the same results with milk from goats that graze on drought-resistant crops like sorghum, which is not typically grown in France. ""We've assembled a jury of experts that will taste test the cheese to make sure it follows all the rules,"" the cheesemaker said. ""They have about 20 criteria of taste.""

Dead trees stand gray and bristly. An aura of doom hangs over the green conifers that remain.The expanse of Sierra National Forest near Shaver Lake is a relic of the climate before global warming. Scientists believe that the conifers won't be able to survive the current conditions. Researchers at Stanford University found in a recent study that roughly one-fifth of all conifer forests in the Sierra are mismatched with the warmer climate and have become ""zombie forests.""""The name 'zombie forest' is kind of kitschy, but I've come to find that it is haunting,"" said ecologist Avery Hill, who co-wrote the study while pursuing a doctorate at Stanford.Hill combed his way through a thicket one afternoon and paused at a clearing overlooking a valley, its pine-studded slopes dotted with boulders ringed by patches of shrubby chaparral.""That's what we think will spread out and eventually cover this whole area,"" he said.The findings indicate that these lower-elevation Sierra conifer forests, which include ponderosa pine, sugar pine and Douglas fir, are no longer able to successfully reproduce. Conditions have become too warm and dry to support conifer saplings, whose shallow roots require plenty of water if they are to survive into adulthood, Hill said. Giant sequoias also grow in lower-elevation areas of the Sierra Nevada, but the researchers didn't analyze the risks specific to those trees.When these forests burn in high-severity wildfires—or are wiped out by drought, disease or pests—they will likely be replaced by other types of trees and brush, the scientists said. That could dramatically slash how much carbon the region can store; provide a habitat for invasive species; and displace plants and animals that call the forests home.Knowing exactly where such changes might take place can help land managers prioritize where to resist the changes and where to accept or even accelerate them.""It provides almost an experimental space to address some really difficult questions about how we manage ecological transitions,"" said Hill, who now works at the California Academy of Sciences.Hill started his doctoral program knowing he wanted to study how human activity affects forests. Then the Nuns fire burned through the redwood forests of Napa, threatening his family home and destroying a shed. To Hill, it was a clear instance of the confluence of wildfire and climate change, leading him to focus on those topics.Zombie forests can persist for a long time without a disturbance to shake them up, Hill said, but research showed that many of the forests are headed for inevitable transitions with the 2.2 degrees of warming that has already occurred in the Sierra.These rapidly changing landscapes could have major implications for how California manages wildfire.Different types of forest burn in different ways, and knowing what will grow where could help authorities plan for fires, Hill said. For instance, chaparral historically supports catastrophic fire on average every 40 to 50 years, versus every 150 to 200 years for conifer forests, he said.""So maybe around communities, you'd prefer to have a well-managed conifer forest,"" he said.To determine which areas of forest are mismatched with thewarmer climate, the scientists examined detailed vegetation data from a U.S. Forest Service survey done in the 1930s. From that, they created a computer model to analyze habitat suitability, and found that while the average elevation of conifer forests has shifted upslope about 110 feet, the temperatures most suitable for the trees have retreated farther up the mountains, about 600 feet on average.They crafted a map of the Sierra splotched with pink—which shows where the forests are outside of the climate where they thrive—and red—where the mismatch is severe.While much of modern-day ecology is focused on understanding transitions by examining those that have already occurred, this map shows where changes are likely to take place, Hill said.""So we can start monitoring them and observing these transitions before they even start, and even start thinking about proactive management in these areas,"" he said.He described the study as a jumping-off point for more research, including whether wildfires burn differently in zombie forests and how that knowledge might be integrated into fire behavior modeling.Sarah Campe, regional scientist with the Sierra Nevada Conservancy, said she found the research thought-provoking. It added to an ongoing conversation about what the forests of the future will look like, she said. Still, she tends to view studies about landscapes' response to climate change with some skepticism.""These landscapes are incredibly complex,"" she said. ""I just don't think our models are there yet to actually be able to understand exactly what will happen.""Climate is just one driver of change affecting these ecosystems, Campe pointed out. More than a century ago, colonizers outlawed cultural burns by Indigenous groups and adopted aggressive fire-suppression policies, and later managed swaths of the region for timber.These practices deprived the Sierra's forests of the regular low-intensity fires to which they'd adapted, and resulted in the removal of the largest, most fire-resistant conifers. Many of these areas are now overcrowded with younger trees that burn more easily.""That has altered the structure and composition of these forests and made them vulnerable to wildfires, to drought and to warmer temperatures,"" she said. ""And certainly, climate is a huge and important driver in all of this, but that doesn't mean that there aren't levers that we can be pulling that aren't directly associated with carbon reduction to help protect these forests or restore these ecosystems.""Hill agreed, but said the researchers chose to focus primarily on climate because it's the foundational condition that determines whether a tree can grow in a particular place.""There are management decisions you can make to kind of squeeze out every last opportunity these trees have to survive by thinning these forests out or introducing prescribed burns or even seeding different species after logging,"" he said. ""But if the climate says no, the forest won't grow.""His team examined different scenarios of global warming and concluded that if humanity allows climate change to occur at rapid rates, nearly all of the Sierra Nevada could become unsuitable for conifer forests by the end of the century. They found that even with improved efforts to cut planet-heating emissions from fossil fuels and other sources of greenhouse gases, the Sierra zombie forests could still double in size this century. But they said efforts to rapidly address climate change could make a big difference.""It's a really stark reminder of how much climate change has already occurred, and how important it is to make sure that the amount that occurs in the future is as little as possible,"" said Chris Field, the study's senior author and director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. ""With aggressive efforts to controlclimate change, then we lose more of the Sierra, but not all of it.""Another nearby patch of land offers a window into what happens to a zombie forest after a disturbance. Three years ago, the Creek fire razed these slopes, its explosive intensity—which scientists likened to an incendiary bombing attack— stoked by millions ofdead treesthat had been weakened by drought and ravaged by bark beetles.Now, blackened spires jut up from the ground as far as the eye can see. Oaks have resprouted, but no conifer saplings are yet evident."" If our models are right, this is more likely than anywhere else to come back as something that's not conifer forest,"" Hill said as he peered out over the stunning devastation.There are measures land managers could take to plant and nurture conifer seedlings, Hill said, but he noted it would come down to resources, asking, ""Is it that important for these lower areas to come back as conifer forest?""Ron Goode, chairman of the North Fork Mono Tribe, said that since the Creek fire, the Mono winds that typically blew 60 to 70 mph had at times increased to 110 mph. And the snow and rains that fell last winter unleashed major flooding.""There's nothing to hold the snow, nothing to hold the water back,"" he said. ""So it's out there on bare rock, bare land. It's going to melt faster.""Still, Goode said, reseeding isn't necessary if people steward the land. Although the soil might be scorched several inches deep, there are seed pods underneath the burned portion, he said. Indigenous people used to poke holes in the earth to allow these seeds to sprout, but forest policies now forbid this, he said.He said that while oaks and chaparral tend to resprout relatively quickly, conifers take three to five years to begin regrowing. So there often needs to be a burn a couple of years after a wildfire to cull the shrubs and give conifers the opportunity to come back.""I always say to my people when I'm working out there that what we do for Mother Nature is we give her a pedicure, a manicure; we even try to clean her up a little bit,"" he said. ""But she's going to the ball in the springtime; she's going to put on her own dress. When you give her the opportunity, she knows how to dress herself up.""""That's the whole difference between what the Native American did with the land and what the European American does to the land—is we put back. We give back,"" he added. ""They don't.""Other interventions could include thinning out the trees so there's enough water to go around, and trying to keep catastrophic fire risk low by culling vegetation that could carry flames from the forest floor up into the canopy, Field said.""These Sierra conifers can live for hundreds and hundreds of years,"" he said. ""And one aspiration of this kind of intervention would be to create a situation where even though the forests are zombies—are not reproducing—we might be able to keep them in place and keep their ecosystem services going for many decades or even centuries.""Land managers may in some cases decide that the best approach is to harvest the existing trees and facilitate the recovery of shrubs or oak trees.For example, within the footprint of the 2018 Camp fire, there was an area of near-totalforestloss that is unlikely to support dense conifer stands in the future, said Campe of the Sierra Nevada Conservancy. Several groups, including the Butte County Resource Conservation District, U.S. Forest Service, Konkow Valley Band of Maidu Indians and the nonprofit American Forests, are facilitating a transition toward an open, oak-dominated woodland.In other places, including recreation areas, tribal cultural sites and habitats that support iconic species likegiant sequoias, it may be worth putting more resources into preserving or restoring the ecosystem, she said.Still, Campe said, the Sierra's land managers—which include government agencies, private landowners, resource conservation districts and tribes—are able to touch just a fraction of the 25-million-acre region due to funding and personnel constraints.""If Mother Nature is hitting a giant 'reset' button, there's going to be huge parts of the landscapes that we won't be able to impact. That's where acceptance comes into play,"" she said. ""This will not be the same Sierra our grandparents knew. But that doesn't mean it won't be a place that we continue to value and enjoy.""2023 Los Angeles Times.

Climate change threatens to reverse decades of progress towards better health and well-being, particularly in the most vulnerable communities. Scientific know-how and resources can help redress the balance, but are not sufficiently accessible or utilized, according to a new multi-agency report coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). WMO's annual State of Climate Services report this year focuses on health. It highlights the need for tailored climate information and services to support the health sector in the face of more extreme weather and poor air quality, shifting infectious disease patterns and food and water insecurity. ""Practically the whole planet has experienced heatwaves this year. The onset of El Nino in 2023 will greatly increase the likelihood of breaking temperature records further, triggering more extreme heat in many parts of the world and in the ocean - and making the challenge even greater,"" says WMO Secretary-General, Prof Petteri Taalas . ""It is clear that by channelling investment and boosting collaboration, there is huge potential to go further and faster by enhancing the impact of climate science and services so that health partners get the support they need at a time when unprecedented changes to our climate are having an increasing impact,"" add Prof. Taalas. The report, which includes input from more than 30 collaborating partners, features case studies from around the world showcasing how integrated climate and health action makes a very real difference in people's daily life. This includes early warning systems for extreme heat, pollen monitoring to help allergy sufferers and satellite surveillance for climate-sensitive diseases. ""The climate crisis is a health crisis, driving more severe and unpredictable weather events, fuelling disease outbreaks, and contributing to higher rates of noncommunicable diseases,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. ""By working together to make high-quality climate services more accessible to the health sector, we can help to protect the health and well-being of people facing the perils of climate change."" Nearly three quarters of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) provide climate data to the health sector, but the uptake is limited. Less than one quarter of Ministries of Health have a health surveillance system that utilizes meteorological information to monitor climate-sensitive health risks. Early Warnings for All The number of medium- or large-scale disaster events is projected to reach 560 a year - or 1.5 each day - by 2030. Countries with limited early warning coverage have disaster mortality that is eight times higher than countries with substantial to comprehensive coverage, according to figures cited in the report. A special section is devoted to extreme heat, which causes the greatest mortality of all extreme weather. However the impacts are underestimated as heat-related mortality could be 30 times higher than what is currently recorded. Heat warning services are provided to health decision makers in only half of the affected countries, but are expected to rapidly increase by 2027 under the international Early Warnings for All initiative. Between 2000 and 2019, estimated deaths due to heat were approximately 489,000 per year, with a particularly high burden in Asia (45%) and Europe (36%). Extreme heat conditions during the summer of 2022, were estimated to have claimed over 60,000 excess deaths in 35 European countries. Heatwaves also exacerbate air pollution, which is already responsible for an estimated 7 million premature deaths every year and is the fourth biggest killer by health risk factor. Climate change is exacerbating risks of food insecurity. In 2012-2021, 29 per cent more global land area was affected by extreme drought for at least one month per year than in 1951-1960. The compounding impacts of droughts and heatwave days were associated with 98 million additional people reporting moderate to severe food insecurity in 2020 than annually in 1981-2010, in 103 countries analysed, according to figures cited in the report. The changing climatic conditions are also enhancing the transmission of many climatically sensitive infectious vector-, food-, and water-borne diseases. For example, dengue is the world's fastest-spreading vector-borne disease, whilst the length of the malaria transmission season has increased in parts of the world. Some of the most significant challenges to health are in the nexus of water, food security and nutrition, the nexus of infectious diseases (food-, water-, airborne and vector-borne diseases), and the nexus of extreme weather and air quality, particularly in urban areas, says the report. Key messages: Climate change undermines health determinants and increases pressures on health systems threatening to reverse decades of progress to promote human health and well-being, particularly in the most vulnerable communities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes, with very high confidence, that future health risks from injury, disease, and death will increase due to more intense and frequent temperature extremes, cyclones, storms, floods, droughts, and wildfires. It is anticipated that over 50 per cent of the excess mortality resulting from climate change by the year 2050 will occur in Africa. Health protection is a priority in almost all countries and requires high-quality information to better inform decision-making. Climate information and services are fundamental for better understanding how and when health systems and population health can be impacted by climate extremes and a changing climate, and for managing climate-related risks. Climate information and services are fundamental for better understanding how and when health systems and population health can be impacted by climate extremes and a changing climate, and for managing risks. Tailored climate products and services can enhance the evidence and information available to health partners to detect, monitor, predict, and manage climate-related health risks. There is huge potential for enhancing the benefits of climate science and climate services for the health sector and for increasing accessibility, relevance and uptake. Only 31 per cent of NMHSs provide climate services at a 'full' or 'advanced' level of capacity. A large range of academic, private sector, and government partners are also working to fill the gap, and this needs to be put on a sustainable and coordinated footing. Extreme heat causes the greatest mortality of all extreme weather, yet heat warning services are provided to health decision makers in only half of the affected countries. According to the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change, rising temperatures and the growing over-65 population have triggered an increase in heat-related mortality in this age group of approximately 68 per cent between 2017-2021, compared to 2000-2004. According to the IPCC, there is ""high confidence"" that Central and South America, southern Europe, southern and Southeast Asia and Africa will be the most affected by climate change in terms of heat-related mortality by 2100, based on 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C increases in the global temperature. The IPCC also notes with ""very high confidence"" significant impacts of heat are expected from the combination of future urban development and the more frequent occurrence of heatwaves, with more hot days and warm nights adding to heat stress in cities. Concerns relating to air quality, climate change, and health are interlinked. Climate mitigation action leading to reducing air pollution can save lives. Despite this, only 2 per cent of climate finance commitments made by international development funders in developing and emerging countries is explicitly aimed at tackling air pollution (in 2015-2021), even though it is the most dangerous environmental threat to health. In 2019, air pollution moved up from the fifth to the fourth place in the scale of leading risk factors for death globally, continuing to exceed the impacts of other widely recognized risk factors for chronic disease like obesity, cardiovascular disease, and malnutrition. There is insufficient investment to improve the capabilities of the health sector, leaving it ill-prepared to safeguard the most vulnerable. Currently, just 0.2 per cent of total bilateral and multilateral adaptation finance supports projects that identify health as the primary focus, and the investment in the capacity for multisectoral and effective climate science and services is miniscule."" Most hydrometeorological investments are not clearly designed to support health outcomes. This needs to change. To fully harness the potential of climate services for health, transformational change in institutional development and integration across the health and climate sectors are needed. In the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic, all countries have experienced the social and economic losses and damages which can occur when the health of society is compromised. More must be done to prepare the health community for future shocks and pressures they may experience due to climate variability and the damaging effects of climate change. The governing World Meteorological Congress in 2023 approved a 10-year strategy on Advancing Integrated Climate, Environment, and Health Science and Services (2023-2033) in collaboration with WHO and other health partners to address the challenges.

By RFA Burmese 2023.11.03 -- Some 5,000 Myanmar nationals, including hundreds of children, who fled into China amid an ethnic army offensive in northern Shan state are in dire need of food and water in Yunnan province, the displaced and their family members said Friday. On Oct. 27, the Northern or ""Three Brotherhood"" Alliance of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Arakan Army and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army launched ""Operation 1027"" - named for the date of the offensive. The groups simultaneously struck junta positions in the strategic Shan cities of Kunlong, Hseni, Chin Shwe Haw, Laukkaing, Namhkan, Kutkai, and Lashio, the state's largest municipality. Fierce fighting in the vicinity of Chin Shwe Haw at the start of the offensive forced some 5,000 residents to cross the border and take up temporary shelter in Yunnan province, Thet Naing, a family member of one of the displaced, told RFA Burmese. On Thursday, Chinese authorities transferred the displaced to Yunnan's Mengding township, where they are now sheltering at a former COVID-19 testing center, he said. ""They said they moved to the vicinity of Mengding and are living in a room there - I heard that it's a building formerly used as a COVID-19 center,"" Thet Naing said. ""They said that the entire camp was moved by vehicles last night because there might be another fierce fight in Chinshwehaw."" Water shortage But supplies are short at the center, located around 30 kilometers (20 miles) east of Chin Shwe Haw, and those sheltering there - including around 700 children - need food, water, and supplies, said one of the displaced, named Ko Sai. ""Because of the water shortage, we have to boil water we received for bathing, and some of us are suffering from diarrhea,"" he said. ""Many are experiencing health problems and some have fainted."" Ko Sai said the center is being ""guarded by the Chinese police and army,"" and that the reason for the water shortage ""is because they aren't allowing donations."" In addition to residents of Chinshwehaw, other displaced people at the center include migrant workers from northern Shan, Kachin and Rakhine states, he said, as well as Yangon, Mandalay and Sagaing regions. Chinese authorities have provided the displaced with tents, which can accommodate anywhere from five to 10 people each, he added. Scant and poor food Htoo Htoo, another displaced Myanmar national at the center, told RFA that while Chinese authorities are providing two meals a day, ""the food isn't good."" ""They provided us with eggs and tomatoes the past two days ... but I can't eat the eggs and tomatoes served today,"" he said. ""The tomatoes are spoiled, so I can only eat rice ... [and while they have offered pork], many people felt nauseated after eating it."" Htoo Htoo said that the displaced ""are not allowed to cook"" and that police had even ""confiscated"" bread and drinking water he ordered with his own money from outside the center. Additionally, goods like sanitary napkins ""are difficult to get"" because of the restrictions on donations, he added. Sources at the center said that when they asked authorities to get them food and water on Thursday, they were ""forced to disperse."" In addition to the shortages, the displaced said they have mostly been unable to contact their families because authorities ""confiscated our phones,"" but noted that Myanmar phone and internet services - normally accessible across the border - had been cut since the fighting began. People at the center told RFA that they want to be allowed to move back across the border to a refugee camp in Shan state's Nam Thit town, which is under the control of the ethnic United Wa State Army. Barring such a move, they want authorities at the camp to provide them with enough food and water, they said. Attempts by RFA to contact the Chinese Embassy in Yangon for comment on the issue of Myanmar nationals fleeing into China went unanswered, as did calls to junta Deputy Information Minister Major Gen. Zaw Min Tun and the Myanmar Embassy in Beijing. Yan Naing, the information officer of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, or MNDAA, said that the displaced ""may have difficulty"" returning to their homes, given the severity of the fighting. ""Our organization helps to take care of those displaced by fighting to the best of our ability,"" he said. ""Right now, during the operation, it is quite difficult to ... return to their homes."" Fighting rages on The fighting in northern Shan state has displaced some 25,000 people since the start of the offensive - around 10,000 in Nam Tit, another 10,000 in cities in northern Shan - including Hseni, Lashio, Kunlong and Mone Koe - and 5,000 in China's Mengding. With roads and transportation cut off as clashes raged, residents of Shan told RFA that there is ""no aid for the displaced."" In a statement on Thursday, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said there have been clashes in at least nine out of 22 townships in northern Shan state, and that the number of displaced persons had reached ""more than 23,000."" The Northern Alliance said that during the eight days of Operation 1027, it had captured more than 90 junta outposts, as well as six armored vehicles. The alliance said it ""effectively controls the cities of Chinshwehaw, Hpawng Hsen and Kyu Koke."" Myanmar junta chief Senior Gen.

A decade later, his property is now dotted with thousands of what he and others hope is a promising new crop for the state following years of punishing drought and a push to scale back on groundwater pumping. The 49-year-old mechanical engineer is one of a growing number of Californians planting agave to be harvested and used to make spirits, much like the way tequila and mezcal are made inMexico. The trend is fueled by the need to find hardy crops that don’t need much water and a booming appetite for premium alcoholic beverages since the COVID-19 pandemic. It's attracted entrepreneurs such as Ortega, as well as some California farmers. They're seeking to shift to more water-efficient crops and irrigation methods to avoid fallowing their fields with looming limits on how much groundwater they can pump, as well as more extreme weather patterns anticipated with climate change. Agave, unlike most other crops, thrives on almost no water. “When we were watering them, they didn’t really grow much, and the ones that weren’t watered were actually growing better,” Ortega said, walking past rows of the succulents. He is now investing in a distillery after his initial batches of spirits, made from Agave americana, sold for $160 a bottle. Consumers started spending more on high-quality spirits during the pandemic shutdowns, which spurred a rise in premium beverage products, said Erlinda A. Doherty, an agave spirits expert and consultant. Tequila and mezcal were the second-fastest growing spirit category in the country in 2022, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Both are proprietary spirits under Mexican laws, which are recognized in U.S. trade agreements. Much like how champagne hails from a region of France, anything called tequila must contain at least 51% blue Weber agave and be distilled in Jalisco or a handful of other Mexican states. Mezcal can be made from a variety of agave types but must be produced in certain Mexican states. Agave growers and distillers in California — as well as some in Texas and Arizona — are betting there is an appetite for more agave-based spirits even if they are produced outside of Mexico and not called tequila or mezcal. “We seem to have this insatiable thirst for agave, so why not have a domestically grown supply?” Doherty said. “I am kind of bullish on it.” Alfonso Mojica Navarro, director of the Mexican Chamber of the Tequila Industry, said tequila has a lengthy history, global reputation for excellence and close connection with Mexican culture. While he didn’t comment specifically on California’s foray into agave spirits, he said he believes Mexico can respond to the growing demand. “The tequila industry is concerned that each time there are more players trying to take advantage of tequila’s success by producing agave spirits, liqueurs or other beverages that allude to the Mexican drink, its origins and characteristics despite not being the same,” he said in a statement. Agave isn't grown on a large scale in California yet, and it would take years for that to happen. But spirits, made by cooking the plant's core to produce sugars that are fermented, are proving popular, said Ventura Spirits owner Henry Tarmy, who distilled his first batch five years ago. “We’ve sold everything we’ve made,” he said. Much like Mexico has, California is taking steps to protect its nascent industry. The state legislature enacted a law last year requiring “California agave spirits” be made solely with plants grown in the state and without additives. A dozen growers and a handful of distillers also formed the California Agave Council last year, and the group has tripled in size since then, said Craig Reynolds, the founding director who planted agave in the Northern California community of Davis. He said those making agave spirits have a deep appreciation for Mexican tequila. “We have about 45 member growers,"" he said. “All of them want more plants.” Agave takes little water but presents other challenges. The plant typically takes at least seven years to grow and is tough to harvest, and a mature plant can weigh hundreds of pounds. Once cut, it has to be grown all over again. Still, many see agave as a viable alternative as California — which supplies the bulk of the country’s produce — explores ways to cut back water use. While record rain and snowfall over the winter mostly ended a three-year drought in California, more dry periods are likely in store. The state enacted a law nearly a decade ago to regulate the pumping of groundwater after excessive pumping led some residents' wells to run dry and the land to sink. Scientists expect extreme weather patterns will become even more common as the planet warms, causing more drought. Stuart Woolf, who grows tomatoes and almonds in the state's crop-rich Central Valley, said he started thinking about agave after estimating he’ll only be able to farm about 60% of his land in 20 years due to water limitations. And that's despite investing in solar energy and groundwater recharge projects to protect the farm that has been in his family for generations. After trying out a test plot a few years ago, Woolf went on to plant some 200,000 agave on land he otherwise would have fallowed. Each acre of agave is taking only 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of water a year — a tenth of what row crops demand and even less than pistachio and almond trees, he said. Woolf and his wife Lisa gave a $100,000 donation to the University of California, Davis, which formed a research fund to look at the succulent’s varieties and its potential as a low-water crop. “I have been trying to figure out what is a crop that I can grow that is somewhat climate-resilient, drought-tolerant, so I can utilize our land,” Woolf said. “The amount of water I am giving them is so low, I don’t think I am ever going to have a problem.”","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'france', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico']",us,True,True

The engravings, dating back 1,000 to 2,000 years, depict human faces, animals, and other figures. These carvings provide insights into the way of life of prehistoric populations. The low river levels have also caused navigable rivers to turn into sand banks and mud, isolating hundreds of communities.

However, concerns remain about the military's involvement and its impact on marginalized communities. The food crisis in Pakistan has reached critical levels, prompting the country's powerful army to take action. Known for its dominance in security and foreign policy, the army has now turned its attention to the economy and agriculture , a move that has raised eyebrows. According to the 2023 Global Hunger Index, Pakistan ranks 102 out of 125 nations, with its hunger level categorized as 'serious'. Although the country is currently food-sufficient, it is not food secure. Inflation and poverty rates have skyrocketed, leaving the masses desperate for basic necessities like flour. Thousands of people gather at government distribution centers, often resulting in stampedes and casualties. Army takes central role In an attempt to address the situation and restore its public image, which suffered due to attacks by ousted PM Imran Khan, the army has taken center stage in combating food insecurity. Over the past six months, the military leadership has played a crucial role in stabilizing the country's struggling economy. Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir is a member of the Special Investment Facilitation Council, established in June to spearhead essential reforms within the economy. Barren land transferred to Army To rapidly increase food production and make Pakistan self-sufficient, the caretaker government has agreed to allocate hundreds of thousands of acres of land to the army for cultivation. In September, a deal was reached to lease over 400,000 hectares of land in Pakistan Punjab to the army for 30 years. Additionally, another agreement was signed to allow the army to cultivate over 17,000 hectares of land in South Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The choice of land in South Waziristan has raised concerns as it is a rugged terrain with complex hills and ridges, extreme climates, and no irrigation system. Despite these challenges, the army plans to farm 1,000 acres initially and expand to 41,000 acres in a bid to enhance agricultural productivity and promote food self-sufficiency in the region. Terrorist activity in the area has been on the rise since the Taliban regained power in Afghanistan in August 2021. In Punjab, most of the land allocated to the army is located in the Cholistan Desert, known for its arid conditions and water shortages. Army becomes largest landowner in Pakistan Critics argue that this transfer of land could make the military the largest landowner in Pakistan, diverting its focus from its primary role of protecting against external threats. Transparency regarding the operationalization of these farms is also lacking, with confusion over profit distribution. While some reports claim the military will not receive any profits, leaked government documents suggest that 20% of the profits will be allocated to farming research and development, with the rest divided equally between the army and the state government. Supporters of the plan believe it will lead to better crop yields and water conservation, addressing Pakistan's depleting foreign exchange reserves and rising commodity prices. However, concerns remain that the military's involvement may further marginalize the country's 25 million rural landless poor. The army's foray into agriculture marks a significant shift in its role and responsibilities, as it tackles the pressing food crisis gripping Pakistan. Time will tell whether this intervention will lead to long-term food security or exacerbate existing inequalities.

Obasanjo also told the youth to reject the toga of being called leaders of tomorrow as they were indeed leaders of today and should. Therefore, go all out to remove any barrier that could hinder them from demonstrating their leadership capacity. According to the former president, the adverse effects of climate change caused by emissions of carbon dioxide such as the resultant abnormal weather conditions, extreme temperatures, flooding, and drought, among others call for concerns and require the joint efforts of all to halt this disturbing trend. Obasanjo said, “Climate change is a reality, though some still believe it is a myth or not real, but we have seen it in flood, drought, the extreme weather conditions, among others. “The scientists have helped us to understand that man has abused the balance of all that God created, the forest, the hills, valleys, animals, among others, to the extent that there is now imbalance. And it is we that caused the imbalance that will also be victims of these consequences, like the sea level rising, victims of floods, drought, extreme weather conditions and, of course, change in climate, food insecurity, among others.” According to Obasanjo, the way to fight climate change is to embrace a green economy, which encompasses all efforts to generate less carbon and absorb more of it through green vegetation.",[],ng,False,False

Invasive species are also known for rapid growth rates and a greater competitive edge that might allow them to recolonise faster. Only in the case of marine animals were both natives and non-natives relatively immune to extreme weather -- although native molluscs and corals are vulnerable to heat waves.Invasive species are not a new problem, but they are growing one. The intergovernmental science advisory panel for the UN Convention on Biodiversity (IPBES) revealed in a landmark report in September that invasive species were increasing at an ""unprecedented rate"" globally, costing more than $400 billion dollars a year in damages and lost income. Invasive species mainly spread as hitchhikers on global trade and played a significant role in 60 percent of all documented plant or animal extinctions, it said.",['china'],in,False,False

Between August and September 2020, 35 elephant carcasses were retrieved from various safaris and protected lands in Zimbabwe — with eleven of these animals dying within a 24-hour period. The team responsible for figuring out what happened initially ruled out intentional poisoning, poaching, and drought conditions, per the study published inNature Communications. There didn't seem to be any signs of external trauma on the elephants. They then decided to look inside and sample the brain, liver, and spleen tissue from 15 elephants and confirmed that six elephants had bacteria known as Bisgaard taxon 45 in their system. They concluded that most, if not all, the elephants died as a result of septicemia, or blood poisoning, caused by the bacteria. ""Although there was not culture or molecular evidence to confirm Bisgaard taxon 45 in more than six mortalities in Zimbabwe,"" the study said, ""the elephants examined were in good body condition and unlikely to have died of drought-related starvation or severe dehydration alone."" The bacteria is not known to kill African elephants, scientists said, but they are beginning to see a potential pattern of cases like this in herds across Africa. There have also been cases of blood infections killing off elephant populations in Asia. The study authors said they are still stumped as to how the bacteria was transmitted to the elephant populations. However, the authors write that climate change-induced factors like heat, drought, and population density could make this type of bacteria transmission more common. ""It's premature to say that climate change has influenced (this) but it may do so in future if we get more and prolonged droughts, or the rainfall patterns (change) and we have a much harsher dry season,"" Dr. Chris Foggin, one of the study's co-authors and a veterinarian at Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust,told CNN.""I do think that if that is the case, then we are more likely to see this sort of mortality event occurring again."" The 35 deaths in Zimbabwe also coincided with a mass die-off of elephants inBotswanain 2020. At least 350 elephants died within a three-month timespan, and researchers at the time concluded thatblue-green algaecontaminated local water sources and poisoned the elephants.

Credit: AP Photo Bob Edme, FileThis year has been so exceptionally hot in part because oceans have been warming, which means they are doing less to counteract global warming than in the past. Historically, the ocean has absorbed as much as 90% of the excess heat from climate change, Burgess said. And in the midst of an El Niño, a natural climate cycle that temporarily warms parts of the ocean and drives weather changes around the world, more warming can be expected in the coming months, she added.Schlosser said that means the world should expect more records to be broken as a result of that warming, but the question is whether they will come in smaller steps going forward. He added that the planet is already exceeding the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times that the Paris agreement was aimed at capping, and that the planet hasn't yet seen the full impact of that warming. Now, he, Burgess and other scientists say, the need for action—to stop planet-warming emissions—is urgent.""It's so much more expensive to keep burning these fossil fuels than it would be to stop doing it. That's basically what it shows,"" said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London.

Surging olive oil prices, driven in part by two years of drought inSpain, has meant opportunity for criminals across the Mediterranean. Warehouse break-ins, dilution of premium oil with inferior product, and falsification of shipping data are on the rise in olive-growing heartlands ofGreece, Spain andItaly. And perhaps worst of all: Gangs using chainsaws to steal heavily laden branches and even entire trees from unguarded groves. “The olive robbers can sometimes produce more oil than the owners themselves – seriously,” Markou said, before heading off to patrol his own grove at nightfall. The crimes mean fewer olives for growers already contending with high production costs and climate change that has brought warmer winters, major flooding and more intense forest fires. In Italy’s southern Puglia region, growers are pleading with police to form an agriculture division. Greek farmers want to bring back a rural police division that was phased out in 2010. In Spain, a company has developed tracking devices that look like olives to try and catch thieves. The olive groves outside Athens are part of a tradition that stretches back to antiquity, on plains that now surround the city’s international airport. Some trees are centuries old. Most of the thefts are branches. When an entire tree is cut down, the thieves typically cut it up and load the pieces into a pickup truck, selling the wood to lumber yards or firewood vendors and taking the olives to an oil mill. “The (robbers) look for heavily loaded branches and they cut them,"" said Neilos Papachristou, who runs an olive mill and nearby grove in a fourth-generation family business. “So, not only do they steal our olives, but they cause the tree serious harm. It takes 4-5 years for it to return to normal.” The thefts are driving some growers to harvest early, which means accepting lower yields to avoid long-term damage to their trees. That includes Christos Bekas, who was among the farmers at Papachristou's mill who were dumping their crop into stainless steel loading bins, untying sacks and tipping over tall wicker baskets from the back of their pickup trucks. Bekas, who owns 5,000 olive trees, suffered repeated raids by thieves before deciding to take an early harvest. That has required more than than 2 1/2 times as much olives by weight to produce a kilogram of oil as last year, he said. “And all this after we’ve been spending nights guarding our fields,” he said. ”The situation is appalling."" After decades of growth, the global olive oil market has been disrupted by a nearly two-year drought in Spain, which typically accounts for about 40% of world supply. It's expected to shrink global production to 2.5 million metric tons this crop year, down from 3.4 million a year earlier. Benchmark prices in Spain, Greece and Italy for extra virgin oil reached 9 euros ($4.35 per pound) in September, more than tripling from their level in 2019. That's translated to higher prices for consumers. In Greece, a 1-liter bottle of extra virgin oil jumped from $8 to $9 last year to as much as $15 this year. Spanish police said in October they had retrieved 91 tons of stolen olives in recent weeks. In February, six people were arrested in southern Greece for the theft of 8 tons of olive oil in a series of warehouse break-ins over several weeks. Farmers around Italy's southwestern port city of Bari say thieves have become increasingly brazen, snatching tractors and expensive equipment along with olives. The regional agricultural association issued a plea for police assistance following reports that 100 olive trees were destroyed or seriously damaged in a single incident last month. Gennaro Sicolo, the association's leader, called the economic damage “enormous” and said “farmers must be protected.” “This is a felony,” Markou, the Greece grower, said of the tree-cutting. “You kill your own history here.” ___ AP journalists Ciaran Giles in Madrid, Colleen Barry in Milan and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report. ___ Follow full AP coverage of climate andenvironment: https://apnews.com/climate-and-environment","['greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'not found', 'belgium']",us,False,False

Following days of heavy torrents, at least 29 people have been killed and more than 300,000 have fled their homes for safety, Somalia’s National Disaster Management Agency (SoDMA) said on Wednesday, calling the phenomenon the most severe in “decades”. “What is going on today is the worst for decades,” said Hassan Isse, managing director of SoDMA. “I do not remember such floods in my life,” said Mohamed Farah, a local elder in Baidoa city, in southwest Somalia. “People keep on evacuating looking for high ground.” The extreme rain presents a new challenge for the Horn of Africa country, which is still reeling from a record drought that crippled its agriculture andkilledas many as 43,000 people last year. Now, Somali authorities are searching for thousands that may be stranded by the floodwater. At least 2,400 people have been cut off in Luuq town alone after the Jubba River burst its banks, the United Nations has warned. “Our makeshift shelters are washing away. Children are missing now. We don’t know whether they are dead or alive”, Fadumo Abdulkadir, who is displaced by the flooding, told Al Jazeera. The flooding in Somalia is part of a regional deluge linked to ongoing weather patterns known as El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole — which impact ocean surface temperatures and cause extreme rainfall, experts say. “The impact of the flooding is much worse because the soil is so damaged from an unprecedented recent drought – years of conflict and al-Shabab militia’s presence also makes building flood defences and resilience more complex and costly”, said Nazanine Moshiri, a climate analyst at the International Crisis Group. The phenomenon has sparked turmoil in neighbouring states Kenya and Ethiopia. In Kenya, torrential downpours over the weekendkilledat least 15 people, while destroying 97 hectares (240 acres) of farmland and wiping out more than 1,000 livestock animals, the Kenya Red Cross Society reported Sunday. Thousands are also reportedly displaced in the Somali region of Ethiopia due to ongoing flooding. Scientists say climate change is causing more intense and more frequent extreme weather events, with the Horn of Africa especially vulnerable. “This cycle of flooding and drought is going to continue. And we’re going to see more and more of this unless we do something on a global scale,” Christophe Hodder, a climate security advisor at the United Nations Environment Programme told Al Jazeera.

With temperatures soaring beyond previous averages by exceptional margins, scientists say the pressure on world leaders to curb planet-heating greenhouse gas pollution has never been more urgent as they prepare to meet in Dubai for the UNCOP28 climate conference this month. Drought parched parts of the United States and Mexico during October, while huge swathes of the planet saw wetter than normal conditions often linked to storms and cyclones, said the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). Sea surface temperatures were the highest ever recorded for the month, a phenomenon driven by global warming that scientists say plays a key role in driving storms to be more ferocious and destructive. ""October 2023 has seen exceptional temperature anomalies, following on from four months of global temperature records being obliterated,"" said Samantha Burgess, C3S Deputy Director. ""We can say with near certainty that 2023 will be the warmest year on record, and is currently 1.43 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average. The sense of urgency for ambitious climate action going into COP28 has never been higher."" The landmark Paris Agreement saw nearly 200 countries pledge to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era and preferably a safer 1.5C. These temperature thresholds will be measured as an average over several decades, rather than a single year. This year has also seen the beginning of a warming El Nino weather phenomenon -- which warms waters in the southern Pacific and stokes hotter weather beyond -- although scientists expect the worst effects to be felt at the end of 2023 and into next year. October was 1.7C warmer than an estimate of the October average for the preindustrial era, Copernicus said. Global average temperatures since January have been the highest in records going back to 1940, the monitor added, registering 1.43C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average. Beyond these official records, scientists say proxy data for the climate going back further -- like tree rings or ice cores -- suggests the temperatures seen this year could be unprecedented in human history, potentially the warmest in more than 100,000 years. Average sea surface temperatures for the month excluding the polar regions also reached all-time highs for October, at 20.79C. Oceans have absorbed 90 percent of the excess heat produced by human activity since the dawn of the industrial age, according to scientists. Warmer oceans are linked to an increase in the intensity of storms and the melting of crucial ice shelves buffering the vast ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, threatening destructive sea level rise. A warmer atmosphere also holds more moisture, resulting in heavier rainfall. Leaders meeting in the United Arab Emirates for the November 30 to December 12 COP28 conference will have to respond to a damning progress report on the world's Paris pledges after major scientific reports have made clear that the world is far off track. Carbon emissions -- largely from fossil fuels -- continue to creep up when they need to be slashed in half this decade. Just under 1.2 degrees Celsius of temperature rise above pre-industrial levels has triggered a range of calamitous and costly weather extremes. People across the planet have faced heatwaves and droughts this year, while severe flooding has struck in the US, China and India and beyond. The report warned that humanity had veered into ""uncharted territory"" with warming that imperils life on Earth. Lead author William Ripple, a professor at Oregon State University said it was likely that annual average temperatures would start to be recorded above 1.5C. ""As warming continues, we face increasing danger from amplifying climate feedback loops and tipping points such as ice sheet melting and forest dieback,"" he said. ""Once crossed, these tipping points could change our climate in ways that may be difficult or impossible to reverse.""","['unitedarabemirates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'mexico', 'senegal', 'senegal', 'greenland', 'france', 'us', 'china', 'india']",us,True,True

High temperatures due to human-caused climate change made the drought ""much more likely to happen"" -- about 25 times more likely in Syria and Iraq and 16 times more likely in Iran, according to the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group. ""Human-induced climate change has increased the intensity of such a drought such that it would not have been classified as a drought in a 1.2C cooler world,"" said the scientists. It found that existing vulnerability from ""years of conflict and political instability"" also reduced people's ability to respond to the drought, sparking a ""humanitarian disaster"". The research focused on the period from July 2020 to June 2023 in two regions where impacts have been most severe: Iran, and the basin of the Tigris and the Euphrates, the rivers that cross Syria and Iraq. Both regions are currently experiencing an ""extreme drought"" as classified by the US Drought Monitor scale, said the scientists in a statement. ""After quite good rains in 2020 and good harvests, three years of very low rainfalls followed with very high temperatures led to a drought with very severe impacts on agricultural access to potable water,"" said co-author Friederike Otto, of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. In an online briefing, co-author Mohammad Rahimi from Iran's Semnan University, called for better resource management. ""Historically we didn't have a lot of rain so this is normal for our region, but the increase in temperature is a new topic,"" he said. Rising temperatures in coming years threaten to evaporate much of the region's precipitation, according to Rahimi. ""We anticipate that we will have more evaporation and transpiration from the plants so am not so optimistic for the future,"" he added. In Iraq, one of the world's leading oil producers, and in war-torn Syria, AFP journalists regularly observe the repercussions of climate change and the drought's impacts on the most vulnerable populations. Both countries have seen a drastic drop in agricultural production in recent years, particularly among wheat farmers. Reduced river flows and water pollution have left little catch for fishermen. By September 2022, the drought had displaced nearly two million people living in rural areas in Syria, according to the WWA. In Iran, water shortages have ""led to tensions with neighbouring countries"" and soaring food prices, the statement said. Conflicts over water are also on the rise in Iraq, where a recent UN report found one in five citizens in the country of 43 million people already suffered from water insecurity. High levels of water stress are exacerbated by a multitude of factors, including inefficient irrigation methods, outdated water treatment plants and rapid population growth. Key water systems are also increasingly sabotaged during conflicts. The scientists warned that ""long-lasting severe droughts like these are no longer rare events"". Instead, they can be expected to occur once every decade in Syria and Iraq, and twice every decade in Iran. ""With every degree of warming, Syria, Iraq and Iran will become even harsher places to live,"" said Rahimi.","['iraq', 'iraq', 'iraq', 'iraq', 'iraq', 'iraq', 'iraq', 'syria', 'syria', 'syria', 'syria', 'syria', 'syria', 'syria', 'iran', 'iran', 'iran', 'iran', 'iran', 'iran', 'iran']",us,False,False

Surging olive oil prices, driven in part by two years of drought inSpain, has meant opportunity for criminals across the Mediterranean. Warehouse break-ins, dilution of premium oil with inferior product, and falsification of shipping data are on the rise in olive-growing heartlands ofGreece, Spain andItaly. And perhaps worst of all: Gangs using chainsaws to steal heavily laden branches and even entire trees from unguarded groves. “The olive robbers can sometimes produce more oil than the owners themselves – seriously,” Markou said, before heading off to patrol his own grove at nightfall. The crimes mean fewer olives for growers already contending with high production costs and climate change that has brought warmer winters, major flooding and more intense forest fires. In Italy’s southern Puglia region, growers are pleading with police to form an agriculture division. Greek farmers want to bring back a rural police division that was phased out in 2010. In Spain, a company has developed tracking devices that look like olives to try and catch thieves. The olive groves outside Athens are part of a tradition that stretches back to antiquity, on plains that now surround the city’s international airport. Some trees are centuries old. Most of the thefts are branches. When an entire tree is cut down, the thieves typically cut it up and load the pieces into a pickup truck, selling the wood to lumber yards or firewood vendors and taking the olives to an oil mill. “The (robbers) look for heavily loaded branches and they cut them,"" said Neilos Papachristou, who runs an olive mill and nearby grove in a fourth-generation family business. “So, not only do they steal our olives, but they cause the tree serious harm. It takes 4-5 years for it to return to normal.” The thefts are driving some growers to harvest early, which means accepting lower yields to avoid long-term damage to their trees. That includes Christos Bekas, who was among the farmers at Papachristou's mill who were dumping their crop into stainless steel loading bins, untying sacks and tipping over tall wicker baskets from the back of their pickup trucks. Bekas, who owns 5,000 olive trees, suffered repeated raids by thieves before deciding to take an early harvest. That has required more than than 2 1/2 times as much olives by weight to produce a kilogram of oil as last year, he said. “And all this after we’ve been spending nights guarding our fields,” he said. ”The situation is appalling."" After decades of growth, the global olive oil market has been disrupted by a nearly two-year drought in Spain, which typically accounts for about 40% of world supply. It's expected to shrink global production to 2.5 million metric tons this crop year, down from 3.4 million a year earlier. Benchmark prices in Spain, Greece and Italy for extra virgin oil reached 9 euros ($4.35 per pound) in September, more than tripling from their level in 2019. That's translated to higher prices for consumers. In Greece, a 1-liter bottle of extra virgin oil jumped from $8 to $9 last year to as much as $15 this year. Spanish police said in October they had retrieved 91 tons of stolen olives in recent weeks. In February, six people were arrested in southern Greece for the theft of 8 tons of olive oil in a series of warehouse break-ins over several weeks. Farmers around Italy's southwestern port city of Bari say thieves have become increasingly brazen, snatching tractors and expensive equipment along with olives. The regional agricultural association issued a plea for police assistance following reports that 100 olive trees were destroyed or seriously damaged in a single incident last month. Gennaro Sicolo, the association's leader, called the economic damage “enormous” and said “farmers must be protected.” “This is a felony,” Markou, the Greece grower, said of the tree-cutting. “You kill your own history here.” ___ AP journalists Ciaran Giles in Madrid, Colleen Barry in Milan and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report. ___ Follow full AP coverage of climate andenvironment: https://apnews.com/climate-and-environment","['greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'not found', 'belgium']",us,False,False

The west Asian drought, … [+3022 chars]",Weather,"A three-year drought that has left millions of people inSyria,Iraqand Iran with little water wouldn’t have happened without human-caused climate change, a new study found. The west Asian drought, which started in July 2020, is mostly because hotter-than-normal temperatures are evaporating the little rainfall that fell, according to a flash study Wednesday by a team of international climate scientists at World Weather Attribution. Without the world warming 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid-19th century, “it would not be a drought at all,” said lead author Friederike Otto, an Imperial College of London climate scientist. It’s a case of climate change unnaturally intensifying naturally dry conditions into a humanitarian crisis that has left people thirsty, hungry and displaced, concluded the research, which has not yet undergone peer review but follows scientifically valid techniques to look for the fingerprints of global warming. The team looked at temperatures, rainfall and moisture levels and compared what happened in the last three years to multiple computer simulations of the conditions in a world without human-caused climate change. “Human-caused global climate change is already making life considerably harder for tens of millions of people in West Asia,” said study co-author Mohammed Rahimi, a professor of climatology at Semnan University in Iran. “With every degree of warming Syria, Iraq and Iran will become even harder places to live.” Computer simulations didn’t find significant climate change fingerprints in the reduced rainfall, which was low but not too rare, Otto said. But evaporation of water in lakes, rivers, wetlands and soil “was much higher than it would have been’’ without climate change-spiked temperatures, she said. In addition to making near-normal water conditions into an extreme drought, study authors calculated that the drought conditions in Syria and Iraq are 25 times more likely because of climate change, and in Iran, 16 times more likely. Kelly Smith, assistant director of the U.S. National Drought Mitigation Center in Nebraska, who was not part of the study, said the research made sense. Drought is not unusual to the Middle East region and conflict, including Syria’s civil war, makes the area even more vulnerable to drought because of degraded infrastructure and weakened water management, said study co-author Rana El Hajj of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre in Lebanon. “This is already touching the limits of what some people are able to adapt to,” Otto said. “As long as we keep burning fossil fuels or even give out new licenses to explore new oil and gas fields these kinds of events will only get worse and keep on destroying livelihoods and keeping food prices high. And this is not just a problem for some parts of the world, but really a problem for everyone.” ___ Follow AP’s climate andenvironmentcoverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Now, under more difficult conditions in the western Kenyan region of Nambale, she's seeing her own fields flourish. This is thanks to switching to sustainable farming practices and joining a new scheme rolled out by carbon-credit startupBoomitra, and an international agricultural alliance. (Boomitra will help Hannah earn extra income for the carbon sequestered on her farm due to her smart agricultural practices by selling those carbon credits to companies seeking to offset emissions.) A continent away in India, another smallholder farmer, Chayya Kundlik Raosurse, is reaping the benefits of another cutting-edge scheme: solar-powered dryers supplied by another development startup,S4S Technologies(S4S). These machines process her perishable produce, prolonging their shelf and market life. The two farmers are benefiting from green innovations that are now getting global recognition. For Boomitra and S4S are winners in the third annualEarthshot Prizeannounced in Singapore today (7 November),winning in the 'Fix Our Climate' and 'Build a waste-free world' categories respectively. Launched by Britain's Prince William in 2020, Earthshot awards US$1.2 million to five winners developing solutions to environmental problems. Finalists get to enter a Fellowship programme giving them the mentorship and technical support they need to scale up their projects. Both Boomitra and S4S Technologies are supported by the World Food Programme (WFP)Innovation Accelerator, which aims to support high-impact innovations to help end hunger. With its vast global network, Innovation Accelerator can foster new partnerships among companies, governments and nongovernmental groups, attracting financial support for innovations to increase their scale and impact. Through their groundbreaking innovations, Boomitra and S4S are helping farmers and entire communities build resilience to climate change, which is delivering a devastating blow to some of the poorest communities in low-income countries. Below we look at how. Kenya: Healthy soils tackle climate-related effects Farmer Hannah Karanja's seen the fallout of extreme weather firsthand. Kenya emerged, this year, from one of its worst droughts on record only to be hit by heavy rains and flash floods, which displaced households and damaged critical infrastructure such as roads and bridges. ""In my childhood the weather patterns were steady, the rains came at specific times, and so our parents knew when to plant and when to harvest,"" says Hannah. ""But now the climate is very unstable. If you do not take the right measures, you will not have a good harvest."" Four years ago, in a bid to keep her farm sustainable and profitable, Hannah began farming using regenerative methods aimed at building healthy soil that is more resistant to drought, heat and other climate impacts. Reaping by hand instead of ploughing, for example, results in healthier soil that is not disturbed so much. By rotating the types of crops she plants, she ensures no single variety drains her fields of critical nutrients. In 2022, Hannah joined an effort by Boomitra and the Farm to Market Alliance (a farmer-focused public-private consortium) to pilot a carbon-credit system inKenya. WFP connected the two groups to scale up Boomitra's innovation, which uses satellite and AI technology to help monitor, report, and verify carbon removal credits. Farmers such as Hannah are paid for the carbon they remove from the atmosphere through healthy soil practices. Changing the way she farms has doubled Hannah's yields and seen her revenues soar, allowing her to pay for her children's schooling and other expenses. She will soon receive additional revenue from the carbon-credit scheme. ""It's from this farm that even my last child went to the university, graduated and is now a lawyer,"" she says. ""My second-last child is an engineer and now I even teach my grandchildren this method of farming."" India: Empowering women farmers In India, 70 percent of rural households depend on agriculture to make a living. Collaborating with local authorities, banks, and nongovernmental groups, with WFP support S4S provided micro-loans to female smallholder farmers in western Maharashtra state, enabling them to buy solar-powered dryers and food processing equipment. ""In the last decade, extreme heat affected the quality of our produce,"" farmer Chayya says, referring to irregular weather linked to climate change that is only expected to intensify.

Authorities have scrambled to rescue thousands of stranded people from the floodwater, which comes on the heels of the region's worst drought in 40 years. ""What is going on today is the worst for decades. It is worse than even the 1997 floods,"" said Hassan Isse, managing director of the Somali Disaster Management Agency (SOMDA). The death toll and numbers of people displaced were likely to rise further, Isse said, because many people were trapped by floodwaters. ""I do not remember such floods in my life,"" said Mohamed Farah, a local elder in Baidoa city, in southwest Somalia. ""People keep on evacuating looking for high ground."" At least 2,400 people have been cut off in Luuq town, where the Jubba River burst its banks, the United Nations has said. ""Luuq is surrounded by the river and floods are threatening us. People keep fleeing out of the town. Some are still trapped. Our shops have been washed away,"" said Ahmed Nur, a trader in Luuq. Floods in neighbouring Kenya have killed at least 15 people and submerged a bridge in Uganda, cutting off a road linking Kampala to oilfields in the northwest, the Kenya Red Cross and Uganda's road authority said. The regional deluge was caused by the combined effect of two weather phenomenons, El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole, said Nazanine Moshiri, a climate analyst at the International Crisis Group. El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole are climate patterns that impact ocean surface temperatures and cause above-average rainfall. ""The impact of the flooding is much worse because the soil is so damaged from an unprecedented recent drought - years of conflict and al Shabaab militia's presence also makes building flood defences and resilience more complex and costly,"" Moshiri said. Scientists say climate change is causing more intense and more frequent extreme weather events. In response, African leaders have proposed new global taxes and reforms to international financial institutions to help fund climate change action.","['somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'sweden', 'kenya', 'uganda', 'uganda']",in,False,False

The UN has released $25m (£20.5m) in aid, describing the floods as a ""once-in-a-century event."" Authorities say at least 29 people have been killed and more than 300,000 displaced, with more rain to come. Somalia and neighbouring countries in East Africa have been hit by heavy rains since early October. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the downpours had been worsened by the combined impact of two climate phenomena - El Niño and the more localised Indian Ocean Dipole, referring to differences in sea surface temperature in opposite parts of the ocean. The agency warned that some 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million acres) of farmland could potentially be destroyed. Martin Griffiths, the UN's Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief coordinator, said: ""Extreme weather linked to the ongoing El Niño risks further driving up humanitarian needs in already-vulnerable communities in Somalia and many other places."" ""We know what the risks are, and we need to get ahead of these looming crises."" The UN humanitarian agency said rescue efforts were being delayed because roads had been cut. Aid groups have also warned that camps for people displaced by an Islamist insurgency and the recent drought had also been flooded, causing people to flee for a second time. OCHA warned on Wednesday that more rain is expected in the coming days, and that the forecast shows very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall is expected in southern Somalia. Somalia is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, and the country is experiencing heavier than normal rains after emerging from one of its worst droughts in four decades. The flooding began last month after heavy rains raised water levels and caused the overflowing of the Juba and Shabelle rivers. Flash floods have also killed dozens of people in neighbouring Kenya and Ethiopia. Earlier this week, Somalia declared an emergency in the most-affected states - Jubbaland, Hirshabelle South West and Galmudug. OCHA said in September that East Africa was likely to encounter heavier than normal rains over the October-December period because of the El Niño phenomenon. El Niño is caused by the Pacific Ocean warming and is linked to flooding, cyclones, drought, and wildfires. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.","['somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'sweden', 'sweden', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'kenya']",gb,False,False

[+] properties due to climate events. For most of the U.S. population, summarizing a home as shelter is a fairly gross underrepresentation of what a home actually delivers, but now many are looking for shelter from more extreme climate events that are capable of reducing our current housing to underperforming shelters. While the challenges have always existed, global real estate data platform CoreLogic reports ever-increasing risks and that now more than 18 million properties valued at $8 trillion are at extreme risk. There are mechanisms in place for protection, such as building codes, insurance, better forecasting, and new design with better performing materials, however, even these mechanisms are proving to have failure points, and sometimes major gaps. Growing Risks Risks are defined in many ways, and to make things even more complicated, housing stakeholders look at them through completely different lenses. A home insurance company evaluates risk differently than the builder, who is different than the homeowner, who is different than the architect. These disparities certainly don’t help the situation, but at the same time, none of the stakeholders can argue with the looming danger of stronger weather events. CoreLogic’s data analyzes property-level physical attributes, property-level financial data, specific peril impacts, and a variety of climate scenarios, to understand the current and future financial impact. The company’s data also takes the age of the housing stock into account, making both granularity and scale important in the outputs. “What CoreLogic does is identify the financial risk for every property in the U.S.,” said Anand Srinivasan, who acts as executive of innovation at CoreLogic. “If the property is greater than 100 square feet, then we have calculated loss estimates and created risk scores that incorporate present and future climate risk. Now, we are getting demand from government officials to look at longer periods because of capital investments.” The data provides a holistic view of all potential hazards, including floods, hurricane winds, wildfires, severe convective storms, severe winter storms, along with earthquake activity. From there, the data can help identify the top risks in financial terms by looking at potential loss, making CoreLogic a useful tool for insurance companies and mortgage originators in underwriting and financial evaluations of properties and policies and portfolios of properties. The data is comprehensive and overwhelming, but the value of the data is critical to all the stakeholders. “We look at the delineation between coverage amount and the mortgage amount, the home value, the equity value, and the reconstruction costs,” Srinivasan said. “And, they all are moving targets, but it helps articulate the risk and then helps define actions on what could be done to reduce the risk and has an impact on what the owner would do.” There are dozens of examples. For instance, the Federal Reserve Board has published a paper using CoreLogic data to identify what destroys a community, defined by the tipping point for consumers to walk away from their damaged property because the damage is too extensive. There have already been instances when a homeowner would choose to use their insurance payment to pay off any remaining loan and then walk away. This sort of data could be the catalyst for a community renovation, funding or what has tragically happened, insurance leaving the area. To understand the data a little better, CoreLogic defines “extreme risk” properties as those having a climate risk score of greater than or equal to 70 out of 100 in any time horizon, or as having a shift in climate risk score between any two time horizons of greater than or equal to 40. Top metrics discussed here include all risks together, but are defined for each peril as well, and exceeding the limit for any one of them defines the property as extreme. The company also uses the term “grave danger” to highlight the magnitude of properties and dollars concentrated in these geographies when compared to the majority of other geographies in the U.S., but has not yet refined their criteria as detailed as “extreme risk.” The data also can be represented over different time horizons to capture a future spike, such as a flood in an area currently suffering a long period of drought, which again could be a catalyst for a community retrofit project. In CoreLogic’s analysis of all markets across the U.S. of extreme risk properties, the reconstruction cost or the dollars needed to rebuild the home in a total loss event, and the total home values or what the home would sell for today, it reports a total of 18 million properties valued at $8 trillion with California, Florida and Texas each carrying between 2.5 and 3.8 million homes. The value at risk in the Miami area is the highest in the country and so are the property counts. Of all the extreme risk properties in the country, about 12% of the units and the value reside in Miami today at 1 million homes with $$814 billion in value, and that risk remains strong over time. The San Francisco area has a slightly lower share of extreme risk houses, but the properties are valued higher on a per house basis, with half a million homes with $600 billion in value at risk. The same goes for San Jose, with 333,000 homes valued at $450 billion and Los Angeles with 383,000 homes valued at $356 billion. Texas is experiencing the opposite phenomenon with a higher percentage of homes at risk, but that are valued lower. So, the highest value of destruction is in the three California cities and the highest population impacted would be in the Dallas and Houston areas. With no mitigation to increase property resiliency with increases in climate risk, a risk score will change from 15 to 54 out of 100 by 2050. Nearly 300,000 model runs of impacts are replicated on the property to project average loss rate in a single year. Risk scores provide a normalized method to easily compare risk across geographies and time without having to do all the math, and an additional score is used to calculate dollars of loss based on the exposure, which is the reconstruction cost. The Failing Role of Building Codes This overhead view of two adjacent properties shows how a fence can act like a wick leading wildfire ... [+] straight to a structure. While building codes are in place for a very good reason, the development of the codes and the management of the codes come with many challenges. Ian Giammanco serves as the managing director of standard and data analytics and lead research at the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety and explains that building codes can be adopted and enforced at a number of levels, with state-level building codes standing out as the only to be uniformly enforced. Local and county codes become a bit more haphazard in their enforcement. “We advocate for statewide code because it is uniformly enforced and it is easier for all,” he said. He provides a strong example. In Florida in 1992, there were many variants of building codes at state, county and city levels, causing conflicts and misunderstanding, so the enforcement was not as strong as it should have been. Those disparities had devastating consequences when the strongest hurricane in Florida’s history hit in 1992 when Hurricane Andrew hit, resulting in the most deaths and the highest dollar of destruction in history. “Codes are there for the communities of tomorrow, so they need to be in place before we build,” Giammanco said. “Every three years code gets updated. They need to be updated regularly so that the latest engineering and science is in there.” As hurricanes continue to batter homes in Florida, the building code improves and now it usually is ranked as first or second in terms of effectiveness nationwide. “Following Hurricane Ian in 2022, we looked at 3,600 homes, 455 of which were built under the modern Florida Building Code, and none had structural damage,” he said. “It shows that the work that is being done is valuable and powerful.” In other extreme events, like wildfires, building codes have a long way to go. “Wildfires hit from the outside in and building codes usually deal with fires that ignite inside a property,” he said. “Only two states, California and Utah, have a wildfire-centric code in place today that is effective to protect outside in.” With the age of today’s housing stock, retrofits and renovations will be critical to protect residents from future events. The building codes for these remodels is harder to manage and to inspire participation with because homeowners have to commit to the upfront costs. A good example of this is the FORTIFIED program that has three levels and roof replacement is one of them. When a homeowner elects to reroof their home, it provides a good opportunity to do something stronger or better. Giammanco has seen successful incentive programs that will cover the cost differential or a claim to cover the added cost to go to a FORTIFIED roof so that the homeowner isn’t responsible for the extra expense, but gets better protection. Insurance Impacts This home was built to the FORTIFIED standard, a voluntary beyond-code construction method that ... [+] strengthens areas of buildings typically vulnerable to high winds and heavy rain. The CoreLogic data consists of 110,000,000 single family residences and, unfortunately, there is no industry-wide accessibility to which properties have insurance that would lead to smarter, safer communities. “We actually could get at analytics if there was industry-wide information on name of the insurer and the coverage A amount on the actual policy,” Srinivasan said. “That would go a long way in identifying under insured gaps. With the vast amount of loans being government backed, it’s surprising there isn’t easily accessible data on it.” Having that knowledge would completely transform this space that is incredibly difficult to manage currently with such little transparency. One means to help today would be to develop more precision in how loss is predicted so that the insurance companies can make appropriate offerings. “The private insurance market is what people really need to get the options for the best price and we have to maintain that,” Giammanco said. “With the changing landscape because of climate, we have to make structures stronger. Insurers are going to look at new products – like parametric insurance that is already in commercial space and might move into residential where the event severity triggers the right coverage.” To help solve these equations, there is a need for better building envelope materials along with better test standards to improve those materials. Then, those materials have to be deployed in the market at a reasonable price to scale up. For instance, composite materials are good at preventing hail damage but are still too expensive. In the case of fire, it’s more complicated and relies on a system where insuring individual homes doesn’t solve for the challenge. “Why fire is so scary is that in suburban neighborhoods, the codes didn’t account for it,” he said. “The neighborhood issue is hard because if two homes are close together and one is perfect but has one weakness it can be exploited because the neighbor did no mitigation. For us to tackle fire we have to do it at large scale – neighborhood, community scale to drive it.” Alabama and Louisiana recently implemented a very successful retrofit grant campaign to bring homes up to code and prevent future damage. The states joke that their grants sell out faster than Taylor Swift concert tickets. After the 2005 hurricane season, Alabama acknowledged it had to do something to maintain a good private insurance space. Launching the Smart Home Alabama program to drive consumer demand to set a benchmark of the minimum that you could do to build to the FORTIFIED standard. Growth started to kick in as builders caught on and local jurisdictions got involved. The grants got more funding and individual insurance carried beyond. “Almost a quarter of all homes in those counties are now built to that standard,” he said. “More than 45,000 homes in those two counties have the designation of being FORTIFIED. It wasn’t just insurance, it was incentives. Grants are like pressing a button for awareness.” Developing New Defenses Across the pond, William Swan and his team at Energy House 2.0 have developed one of the world’s most sophisticated testing centers that help manufacturers and industry players understand climate impacts on a variety of scales. “We need to build a new product,” he said about today’s housing. “The product previously built has been built for many, many years and there are issues around financing, insurance, between builders and energy providers. The business models are changing, so all the underlying institutional frameworks have to adjust.” Snow covers the ground of a testing chamber at the University of Salford's Energy House 2.0 testing ... [+] center. At the Energy House there are testing chambers where the team can construct a whole building, giving a holistic picture of the inputs, while also reducing the length and the expense of field trials. Wind, snow and solar can be measured in the chamber showing impacts on temperature, and the relative humidity. “At the lab, you can compress the time to undertake research by controlling the weather and by doing repeated experiments,” Swan said. “There are more data to see why things worked, not just if they worked, which is difficult in the field. We also could change the house as needed, energy systems, boilers, different ways to control, EVs, renewables and how all these things interact and even down to what difference does carpet make to energy efficiency.” Swan says the testing is all about the future. For example, Energy House is working with the homebuilders Bellway and Barratt to test the product they will be offering in 2025. “The demands on the performance of those buildings is much higher,” he said. “They have been building the same thing for 50 years, but future home standards means that they cannot use gas and the standards for building are much higher, which may be difficult to scale using traditional building methods.” The future also means issues that aren’t prevalent today, like overheating and making homes very water efficient to deal with droughts. The new extremes with hurricane force winds are very difficult but can be tested in the chambers, along with flooding by building a concrete base around the house and filling it with water. “When the homes are built, we put sensors in the walls, and each home has nearly $50,000 of sensors so every circuit or element can be monitored,” he said. The sensors provide data that is then collected and analyzed. Then, Energy House distributes the new knowledge to the industry at large to inform regulatory standards groups and policy bodies. Providing the research and doing the science is in the lab’s expert hands but leaves a fundamental responsibility to the builders. “As much as we are doing the science, the builders need to tell a story that the consumers can understand and make as usable as possible,” Swan said. Innovation is gaining ground, with homes such as this cantilevered design that can survive floodplains – a great story for a home buyer. Here are three other housing innovations that stand up to the most aggressive hurricane forces. As the future data predicts, we need to be prepared – with smarter products, systems, and programs.

The United Nations and its partners estimate that 1.6 million people could be affected by flooding in the current deyr (October to December) rainy season, with 1.5 million hectares of farmland potentially being destroyed. Increased rainfall is forecast due to a concurrence of El Niño conditions and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole phenomenon. The Food and Agriculture Organization's Somali Water and Land Information Management projects a flood event of a magnitude statistically likely only once in 100 years, with significant anticipated humanitarian impacts. While all possible preparatory measures are being pursued, a flood of this magnitude can only be mitigated and not prevented. Early warning and early action can save lives and livelihoods, but large-scale displacement, increased humanitarian needs and further destruction of property remain likely. The newly-released funds - $10 million from the Central Emergency Fund (CERF) and $15 million from the Somalia Humanitarian Fund - will support efforts to prevent loss of life, stem disease outbreaks and address food insecurity. Somalia, which has been emerging from a historic drought, is one of many countries facing a heightened risk of flooding, drought, and extreme heat in the coming months spurred by the El Niño and the positive Indian Ocean Dipole. ""Extreme weather linked to the ongoing El Niño risks further driving up humanitarian needs in already-vulnerable communities in Somalia and many other places,"" said Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. ""We know what the risks are, and we need to get ahead of these looming crises."" The CERF funds will help UN agencies and partners assist more than 280,000 people during the initial phase of the crisis, while the Somalia Humanitarian Fund resources will support more than 420,000 people. The humanitarian system now regularly incorporates extreme weather warnings, including seasonal forecasting, to inform anticipatory and early action to get ahead of crises. CERF is using a proactive approach to address the potential consequences of the current El Niño globally.

one month after he received Saudi Arabia’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Adel Al-Jubeir, who was in Abuja to invite him to the Saudi-Africa summit officially.The President said Nigeria is eager to enhance collaboration with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on combating terrorist organisations such as Boko Haram, ISWAP, and other violent extremist groups terrorising the Lake Chad and Sahel regions.Tinubu noted that Nigeria, like the Kingdom, is diversifying its economy away from oil dependence to promote sustainable development.He recounted, “My administration has undertaken bold economic reforms by removing wasteful subsidies on petroleum and the merging of our foreign exchange market, among other incentives aimed at improving the ease of doing business in Nigeria.”While assuring potential Saudi investors of safety and good returns on their investments, he maintained that “the benefit attached to the early inauguration of the Nigeria-Saudi Business Council cannot be over-emphasised.”Citing the diplomatic history between the two nations in the past six decades, the President said Nigeria-Saudi cooperation, which was initially hajj-centric, has witnessed diversification to cover several areas of common interest.He expressed delight at the presence of many Nigerian professionals in the Kingdom, including highly skilled medical practitioners and professional football players.Tinubu said as members of several international organisations such as the United Nations, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the International Energy Forum, the G77, the Islamic Development Bank, and the Digital Cooperation Organisation, among others, both nations have effectively used these and other platforms to enhance close interaction and coordination.Related NewsGovernorship Election Live UpdatesFRC commends Tinubu on fiscal regulatory frameworkMake government tertiary institutions tuition-free, ECWA urges TinubuKwara monarch says

Around 1.6 million people in Somalia could be affected by the heavy seasonal downpours, which have been worsened by the combined impact of two climate phenomenons, El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement late on Thursday. The floods, which followed heavy rains that started in early October, have already killed at least 29 people and forced more than 300,000 from their homes in Somalia, and inundated towns and villages across northern Kenya. Camps for people displaced by an Islamist insurgency and the worst drought in four decades have also been flooded, causing people to flee for a second time, aid groups say. Large-scale displacement, increased humanitarian needs and further destruction of property remain likely, OCHA said, with some 1.5 million hectares (3.70 million acres)of farmland potentially being destroyed. ""Extreme weather linked to the ongoing El Nino risks further driving up humanitarian needs in already-vulnerable communities in Somalia and many other places,"" said Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General, the UN's Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.

France replaces Italy, who has held the top production spot for the past 9 years. However, France’s rise to the top spot wasn’t due to planting more vineyards, but because so many other large wine producing countries were afflicted by extreme weather patterns that decimated their grape crops. “Once again extreme climatic conditions like early frost, heavy rainfall, and drought have significantly impacted the output of the world vineyard. Meteorological anomalies are becoming the new normality,” explained Giorgio Delgrosso, Head of Statistics & Digital Transformation Department with the OIV, in a webinar. Each year the OIV collects data on the vineyard and global wine production, focusing on the 29 countries which produce 94% of the world’s wine. Despite France’s bountiful 2023 harvest (preliminary estimates of 45.8 mhl), in prior years it was also the victim of extreme heat and frost, causing loss of wine grapes, especially in 2021. Examples of countries that were on the losing side this year were Spain, which fell 14% in production, primarily due to drought conditions, and Italy, with a 12% decrease due to heavy rains resulting in mildew that destroys grapes. Many South American countries saw record decreases in crop sizes due to drought and wildfires, with Argentina down 23%, Chile down 20%, Brazil down 30% and Uruguay down a whopping 34%. This trend continued in Australia where a reduction of 24% was recorded, with South Africa documenting a 10% decrease in wine grape production. 2023 Estimated Global Wine Production in mhl from Top 10 Countries Because of the extreme weather conditions, Delgrosso reported that, “In 2023, world wine production is expected to be the smallest in the last 60 years.” The few other countries that had average grape crop sizes this year were the U.S., New Zealand, Romania, Portugal and Bulgaria, though both the U.S. and New Zealand were down in 2022 due to a combination of droughts, heavy rains and frost. For anyone who doesn’t believe climate change is real, just spend some time in a vineyard. Wine grapes are one of the most sensitive of agriculture crops, and the extreme weather variations, and rising temperatures and green-house gases documented by NASA, NOA and other agencies, are having a negative effect on production. A Blessing in Disguise? However, perhaps the lower wine grape production levels in 2023 aren’t all doom and gloom, because global wine sales have been falling in the last several years. This is especially the case in Europe, where younger consumers are not adopting wine as much as their elders. A recent report by Barron showed that wine consumption fell by 34% in Portugal, 22% in Germany and 10% in Spain in the last year alone. And though the numbers are not as dour in the U.S., wine volume sales have fallen by 4.5% and value sales are down 1% in the past 52 weeks since July 2023, according to a NielsenIQ presentation at a Wine Market Council webinar. In a strange way, perhaps Mother Nature is trying to help global wine production to come into balance. This is because when there is over-production, EU countries often pay farmers to pull out the grape vines and/or convert the crops to alcohol, which can be used for hand sanitizer and other products. In fact in France earlier this year, the government announced they are paying farmers $215 million to convert the grapes to alcohol, to help offset France’s large crop. 2023 Global Wine Production Lowest in 60 Years In Tough Times, Innovative New Wine Brands Can Be Developed In the U.S., where the government rarely pays subsidies to grape farmers, times of over production with a surplus of wine grapes on the market and falling consumption have often given way to innovative new products. For example in 1979, when consumption had flattened in the U.S. and the crop was large, Bartle’s and James wine coolers were developed, ushering in 5-years of solid growth in wine coolers. With the next decline in the late 1980’s, 60-Minutes broke the story on the ‘French paradox’ in 1991, and suddenly red wines were popular, especially Merlot. When consumption dipped again in 2001 and there was a very large high-quality California grape crop, Franzia Wine company developed ‘Two-Buck Chuck’ for Trader Jo’s. The quality of the grapes was so high in the beginning that the $2 chardonnay actually was awarded high scores by critics, and it flew off shelves. U.S. Wine Consumption From 1930 to 2022 Then with the 2008 dip in consumption and another healthy grape crop, Gallo introduced Apothetic red blends whose fruity, semi-sweet flavors were met with positive consumer response, ushering in a huge trend in ‘red blends’. Now the U.S. wine industry is at another crossroads with a large healthy grape crop and decreasing consumer wine consumption. It is time for product innovation again.","['france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'italy', 'italy', 'spain', 'spain', 'argentina', 'chile', 'brazil', 'uruguay', 'australia', 'southafrica', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'newzealand', 'newzealand', 'romania', 'portugal', 'portugal', 'bulgaria', 'germany', 'unitedstates']",us,True,False

Fal… [+6404 chars]",Weather,"MOUNT ANGEL, Ore. --On a bright day this fall, tractors crisscrossed Gayle Goschie's farm about an hour outside Portland, Oregon. Goschie is in the beer business — a fourth-generation hops farmer. Fall is the off-season, when the trellises are bare, but recently, her farming team has been adding winter barley, a relatively newer crop in the world of beer, to their rotation, preparing barley seeds by the bucketful. In the face of human-caused climate change impacting water access and weather patterns in the Willamette Valley — a region known for hops growing — Goschie will need all the new strategies the farm can get to sustain what they produce and provide to local and larger breweries alike. All of a sudden, climate change ""was not coming any longer,"" Goschie said, “it was here.” Climate change is anticipated to only further the challenges producers are already seeing in two key beer crops, hops and barley. Some hops and barley growers in the U.S. say they’ve already seen their crops impacted by extreme heat, drought and unpredictable growing seasons. Researchers are working with growers to help counter the effects of more volatile weather systems with improved hop varieties that can withstand drought and by adding winter barley to the mix. Researchers have known for a while that beer production will be affected by climate change, said Mirek Trnka, a professor at the Global Change Research Institute. He and his team recently authored a study modeling the effect of climate change on hops, out last month in Nature Communications, that projected that yields in Europe will decrease between four to 18% by 2050. His first study on hops 15 years ago issued a similar warning to his latest paper. ""If we don’t act, we’re just going to also lose things that we consider not to be, for example, sensitive or related to climate change. Like beer,” he said. Climate change moves faster than we might realize – but still too slowly for many to notice, he said. The fact that researchers have started picking up on this means that there’s promise for adaptation and solutions in the form of farming changes, but Trnka still has his concerns. Hops declines in Europe mean changes for American producers too. One craft brewery that gets some of their hops from Goschie said that the company is trying to replicate the flavors of German hops using new varieties grown in the U.S. because the ones they depend upon from Europe have been impacted by hot, dry summers over the last couple of years. That’s why some researchers are working on varieties of hops that can better withstand summer heat, warmer winters, changing pests and diseases and less snowfall, which could mean less available irrigation, said Shaun Townsend, an associate professor and senior researcher at Oregon State University. Townsend is working on a project where he subjects hops to drought stress to eventually create more drought-tolerant varieties. It’s no easy task, one that can take a decade, and one that also has to take into account brewers’ main considerations, taste and yield. But the possibility of running out of water is a reality that's on people's radars, he said. Better hops might still be a technology that’s a work in progress, but the story of barley improvements is already well underway. Kevin Smith, professor of agronomy and plant genetics at the University of Minnesota, said that while spring barley is the dominant type for the U.S. beer industry, winter barley – which is planted in the fall and kept on fields during the coldest months of the year – may be more feasible now in the Midwest, where other barley types had been given up due to climate, plant disease and economic factors in favor of crops that are less risky. Winter barley may also be desirable for craft breweries that have started emphasizing local ingredients and who want something grown close by. And it can also be grown as a cover crop, meaning that farmers can prevent erosion, improve their soil health and keep carbon stored in the ground by planting it during the off-season when fields are normally bare. But there hasn’t always been complete consensus on the promise of winter barley. Smith told a story about his predecessor, who was a longtime spring barley breeder. Another scientist – Patrick Hayes, a professor at Oregon State University – was describing to him his hopes for the future of winter barley. Smith’s predecessor wrote on a business card, “it can’t be done,” referring to his firm belief that winter barley just wasn’t worth the trouble. Hayes kept the card in his office, and has made it his life’s mission to work on improving winter barley. There are now winter barley programs at nearly every state in the country, said Ashley McFarland, the vice president and technical director of the American Malting Barley Association. She doesn’t think winter barley will ever be the entirety of the crop in the U.S., but says that producers will need to diversify their risk in order to be more resilient to climate shocks. Molson Coors and Anheuser Busch, the two biggest beer companies in the U.S., issue annual environmental reports that pledge commitments to sustainably sourcing hops and barley and reducing water usage, but neither company responded to an Associated Press request for comment on the specifics of those efforts. Hops can be a finicky crop when it comes to their climate, and without water, you simply can't make beer, said Douglass Miller, senior lecturer at Cornell who teaches a class on beer. He added that the price of beer might rise due to climate impacts on the supply chain — but so will the price of everything else on the menu. “All beverage categories are being impacted by this,” he said. No matter what farmers and companies do with hops and winter barley, climate change may affect what beer-lovers are able to buy in the future. “It will be increasingly difficult for us as plant breeders to provide new varieties of barley and new varieties of hops that can meet, just, all of the terrors of the climate change process,” Hayes said. “And I say terrors because … it’s that volatility, which is so, so frightening.” ___ Associated Press journalist Dee-Ann Durbin contributed from Detroit.

The Mexican National Water Commission and mayor announced the moves at a news conference, but officials did not report the cuts on social media until just four hours before they took effect. Abnormally low rain has dropped the Cutzamala system — a network of three reservoirs serving over 20 million residents in the Valley of Mexico — to historic seasonal lows. The system is 44% lower than it should be at this time of the year. Officials began restricting water from Cutzamala by roughly 8% on Oct. 17. Friday's cuts are much more drastic, representing a further 25% of the system's total flow. Twelve boroughs, mostly in the west of the city, can expect lower water pressure until the restrictions lift, officials said. Officials did not specify when that would be, saying only that restrictions would stand for “the next few months.” They noted the rainy season — which at normal levels of precipitation would replenish the city's water — won't start until around May. Mexico has never before announced such stringent or long-running restrictions to the city's water because of drought. The city's residents have suffered worse cuts in the past, but only because of strikes or repairs, all of which ended within days. Officials said El Niño and heat waves caused the recent falloff in rain, but added that drought conditions have been intensifying the past four years and gradually lowering reservoir levels. Studies have shown climate change creates stronger El Niño patterns that bring periods of decreased rain. “The country has been subjected to extreme weather phenomena, and the Cutzamala System is no exception,” said the water commission's head, Germán Arturo Martínez Santoyo. Mexico as a whole had 25% less rainfall than expected this year, compared to averages from the past three decades. More than three-quarters of the country is experiencing drought, the commission reported, while 93% of the Valley of Mexico itself is in drought, the country's chief meteorological expert said. Officials announced three new water wells and improvements to 58 existing wells, despite experts warning that the city's groundwater is already severely depleted. The commission also said it would continue work on a new water treatment plant at the Madin reservoir, just northwest of Mexico City.

It is simple, almost rudimentary, technology. But they help the farmers to process excess or lower quality crop - which would ordinarily go to waste - into valuable products that can increase their profit. The dryers have been deployed around 400 villages and are made by India's S4S Technologies, one of five organisations that won the Earthshot Prize this week. The £1m ($1.2m) award was started by Britain's Prince William in 2014 with the aim of finding and scaling up innovative solutions to the world's greatest environmental challenges. ""S4S, along with women farmers, are creating a new food ecosystem that reduces wastage and mitigates the increase in greenhouse gas emissions while meeting the world's food needs,"" co-founder of S4S Technologies Nidhi Pant said in a statement after the award ceremony in Singapore. Indian farmers are contending with the impact of climate change every day, and they are not alone. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified the Asia-Pacific as the region most vulnerable to climate change, with 13 out of 30 countries on the continent facing significant fallout. Home to multiple low-lying coastal cities which are exposed to flood and typhoon risk, the region also faces dramatic increases in heat and humidity; extreme rainfall is forecast in some areas, while drought is anticipated in others. But Asia is also home to a great deal of innovation, actress Cate Blanchett said on the ""green"" carpet ahead of the Earthshot Prize ceremony. ""There are so many people out there of all age groups and demographics, from all cultures, actually doing things within their own communities, in their own regions to tackle issues caused by the very rapidly changing climate,"" The founders of Hong Kong-based GRST, which won in the ""Clean Our Air"" category, are anticipating the transition to electric vehicles around the world with their eco-friendly lithium ion battery technology. They plan to use the prize to scale up their operations - GRST produces its batteries in China where it also sells them but plans to expand to Canada, Europe and Singapore. ""During the battery production, there's a lot of emissions and toxic chemicals that go into the conventional way of doing it. We've replaced those with water and water-soluble materials, so [it's] very clean and much lower energy usage. But the important point is at the end of life, our batteries are [more] easily recycled than water so we can minimise the need for future mining,"" they said at the award ceremony. Meaghan Brosnan was in the US Coast Guard for 20 years before joining WildAid, which won in the ""Revive our Oceans"" category. WildAid is working with communities and governments around the world - including in China, the Philippines and Palau - to combat illegal fishing and protect ecosystems in marine protected areas. ""We're also working with some local communities to modify their fishing nets, so that they will not capture and drown sea turtles,"" Ms Brosnan said. Aadith Moorthy, from the Indian state of Karnataka, is the founder of Boomitra, another Earthshot Prize winner. Mr Moorthy works with farmers to improve their agricultural practices by checking soil health and maximising crop diversity. He was passing through an Indian village in 2017 when he came across the funeral procession for a farmer who had taken his own life because of crop failure. This tragic moment eventually inspired Boomitra, which means ""friend of the earth"". Noting that Boomitra currently works with about 150,000 farmers and on some five million acres of land around the world, he stressed that ""two more zeros"" need to be added to these statistics in order to move the needle on climate change. The energy for innovation and solving the planet's problems was palpable amongst participants and trustees on the green carpet. ""What we all need in the climate space is both action and hope. And the finalists that we see, they provide both,"" former New Zealand Prime Minister and Earthshot trustee Jacinda Ardern said ahead of the ceremony. Christina Figueres - who headed UN climate negotiations for six years and played a key role in the talks that led to the Paris Climate Agreement - told the BBC that she wanted to take Earthshot to Asia because the region ""leads the world into the future"". Noting the rate of growth in the region, as well as the demand for energy both in population as well as in industrial productivity, Ms Figueres praised the ""brilliant, disruptive efforts"" of people and organisations in the Asia-Pacific to address environmental challenges in a timely fashion. Prince William also expressed hopes that the Earthshot Prize would expand into a global movement, in which governments are more engaged in green sectors so that climate change would be easier to tackle. ""Our winners and all our finalists remind us that, no matter where you are on our planet, the spirit of ingenuity, and the ability to inspire change, surrounds us all,"" he said.

The ruling Union for the Homeland coalition's nominee Sergio Massa will square off against the far-right libertarian candidate Javier Milei in a run-off election next Sunday, with the vote deciding who has the right to govern the South American nation for the next four years. Whoever wins will have to try to tackle chronic hyperinflation, stabilize currency markets, and prevent the country from slipping into its sixth recession of the past 10 years. Here are seven reasons why Argentina's economy is such a disaster. Soaring prices are perhaps the best-known problem plaguing Argentina's economy, but far from the only issue that policymakers are battling. In February, year-on-year inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Indextopped 100%for the first time in three decades. The rate has held above that level since, steadily climbing to hit 138% in September, according to theNational Institute of Statistics and Censuses. Beef and other foods have played a key role in driving up inflation in Argentina, a country that eats more red meat than any other in the world. In the largest city of Buenos Aires, the price of beef cuts jumped 72% over the 12 month period before June 2022, per official statistics. The government has responded by rolling outprice control programsand late last year ordered manufacturers and retailers to freeze the cost of thousands of goods, including food, drinks, and personal-hygiene products. TheArgentinian peso's crash in value has been both a symptom and a source of the country's economic woes in recent years. The currency is managed by Argentina's central bank. In August, policymakersdevalued it by 18%in a single day to 350 pesos per dollar after the ultraconservative, far-right Milei, who has pledged to do away with the peso andadopt the greenback,won a key primary vote. But rather than accessing that official exchange rate, many have turned to using a free-floating, black-market currency that's known locally as the ""dollar blue,"" which trades closer to 600 pesos per dollar. The existence of multiple exchange rates has undermined the government and raised the risk that hyperinflation becomes entrenched, according to Oxford Economics' Lucila Bonilla, with many Argentinians now asking for wages in-line with CPI. ""The lack of credibility of very complicated exchange-rate regime generates a huge gap between the official and parallel rate, and the widespread indexation of wages and pensions to inflation generates inertia,"" she told Insider via e-mail. The Central Bank of Argentina's decision to devalue the peso by 18% in August ""translated instantly into two-digit monthly inflation rates,"" Bonilla added. Debt is another issue that has plagued Argentina's economy in recent years. Three years ago, officialsreached a dealwith the International Monetary Fund so that the country could climb out of its 9th-ever default, but worries about the deficit have lingered ever since. Most banks have been reluctant to certify government-issued bonds as investment grade due to Argentina's long history of credit crises, with some now trading at around 30 cents on the dollar. That means whoever does win next Sunday's run-off vote will find it difficult to access financing, limiting their ability to fund any potential spending projects they've promised. Not every economic issue Argentina is facing has been of the government's own making. This year, the country's crops have been ravaged by one ofthe worst droughts on record,and the loss of soy, corn, and wheat could cost farmers $14 billion, one economist told Reuters in March. Agriculture made up over 6% of the Argentina's GDP last year, according to data from theWorld Bank. Exporting grain has also served as a key source of other currencies — so the drought has likely contributed to the instability that's plagued the peso, as well as the country's general economic malaise. ""To be fair to Argentina, some of the issues are beyond policymakers' control,"" Capital Economics' Kimberley Sperrfechter told Insider. ""There's been a constant drought which weighs heavily on agriculture, which is both an important part of the economy and crucial to bringing in FX reserves,"" she added. It shouldn't be a surprise that a country plagued by so many problems has had its fair share of economic slumps. By most indicators, Argentina is now teetering on the brink of a recession. The central bank expects the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to shrink 2.8% this year, according to a recent survey of analysts, while activity plunged to its lowest level since 2020 back in May. There's a human side to the economic crisis, as well. Two-fifths of the country's population lives below the poverty line, perReuters, and that figure is likely to rise if there's another downturn. Thousands of protesters took to the streets last year in a rally against the government's failure to address soaring inflation and tanking growth. If, or more likely when, Argentina's economy slips into another recession, it'll be the sixth such occurrence in the past decade. Spare a thought for the beleaguered Central Bank of Argentina — because there's not much monetary policymakers can do to get the economy out of this mess. The central bank has raised interest rates to aneye-popping 133%,but because that barely outpaces the rate that prices are actually rising, it is unlikely to be prove effective at reining inflation in. With the rolling debt crisis meaning it has limited access to loans, the government has instead chosen to finance spending projects by asking the bank to print more money — widely regarded by economists as a policy that'll only serve to drive inflation even higher. Perhaps no politician would be able to fix Argentina's economy — but neither of the candidates voters are set to pick between seem to be inspiring much confidence. Massa has been Minister for the Economy for the past year and has failed to rein in inflation or rescue growth. He's the candidate backed by the Peronist party, which has won 10 of the past 13 elections. Meanwhile, Milei is a relative outsider who seems to model himself after right-wing firebrands like Donald Trump and Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro. His proposed policies include abolishing Argentina's central bank altogether and adopting the dollar, which economists have warned could end up pushing the country even closer to a default. ""Whoever becomes president, it's hard to overstate the economic challenges they'll inherit,"" Sperrfechter told Insider. ""Maybe there'll be steps in the right direction, but Argentina will likely continue to struggle.""","['argentina', 'argentina', 'argentina', 'argentina', 'argentina', 'argentina', 'argentina', 'argentina', 'argentina', 'argentina', 'argentina', 'argentina', 'argentina', 'argentina', 'argentina', 'brazil']",us,False,False

In it, Pascoe argues many pre-colonial Aboriginal groups were farmers, pointing to examples like eel aquaculture in Victoria, and grain planting and threshing of native millet in the arid center.The debate has drawn in everyone from academics to Aboriginal communities invested in food futures to shock jocks claiming it is a warping of history.For our group of archaeologists and First Nations people, the fact this debate has raged so long suggests there are shortcomings in how we think of food production and how we investigate it in Australian archaeology.Farmers versus foragers is a huge oversimplification of what was a mosaic of food production. After all, Australian landscapes differ markedly, from tropical rainforest to snowy mountains to arid spinifex country. For many Aboriginal people, the terms ""farming"" and ""hunter-gatherer"" do not capture the realities of 60 millennia of food production.In ournew researchpublished in theArchaeology of Food and Foodways, we argue that to better understand millennia-old systems, archaeologists must engage deeply with fields such asplant genetics, ethnobotany, archaeobotany and bioarchaeology as well as listening more carefully to the views of Aboriginal people. Here's how.We need to use better methodsFor decades, archaeologists have grappled with the task of understanding ancient food production. We are by no means the first to point to the lack of appropriate methods as a reason why this has proved hard.ArchaeobotanistsAnna Florinand Xavier Carah have observed that food production systems in northern Australia are very similar to those in Papua New Guinea. While we accept Papuan food gardens, Australian archaeologists have been less eager to embrace this idea for Australia.In part, this is a failure of terminology. Aboriginal food production was enormously varied.The solution lies in better methods. For instance, many Aboriginal groups lived semi-permanently in gunyah (bark hut) villages, as Dark Emu demonstrates by quoting colonial observers.These settlement sites are vital to gaining a better understanding of how people lived. By excavating gunyah sites and fireplaces where food was prepared, we can recover seeds by sieving dirt and ash to find out which plants people used. The problem? Many of the sieves used were not fine enough to capture the tiny seeds of vital plants such as native millet. Most seeds used by Aboriginal groups were less than 1mm in radius.This can be fixed. In south-west Asia, archeobotanists have long used fine mesh sieves to recover ancient seeds. You also need reference collections of seeds to be able to identify them from fireplaces.Genetics—and archaeology?It might not sound like a natural fit. But around the world, combining plant genetics with archaeology has dramatically changed our understanding of how people used plants, how they moved them about the landscape and how they changed these plants into forms better suiting our use. The wild precursor of corn, for instance,looks almost nothinglike what we molded it into through selection.Combining these approaches is only in its infancy in Australia. But early applications together with Aboriginal knowledge of plant use has revealed dramatic new insights into how Aboriginal people moved important species such asblack beanCastanospermum australe around the landscape and cultivated them.The legacy of these food production techniques may still be visible today. For instance, when we look at the four species of native rice, we would not expect them to have large seeds. But all four species do. For millennia, Aboriginal groups in Australia's wet north farmed these floodplain grasses. They may well have provided someselective pressurethat resulted in larger grains, as early farmers did elsewhere.To date, we don't know this for sure. But we can find out. Careful genetic analysis of remainingwild populationsshould tell us if these large grains came from human rather than natural selection. We can also analyzegenetic diversitybetween wild rice populations, to see if Aboriginal groups were involved in spreading these useful plants further.Stories from ancestral remainsEvery bone tells a story. In your bones lie traces of how fast you grew, what you ate and how hard your life was.Studying ancestral remains is a very sensitive issue due to the colonial practice of collecting Aboriginal remains for research. But when done sensitively and respectfully, it yields fresh insights.Bones and teeth can tell us many things about life in Aboriginal Australia. Tracking changes in isotope ratios in teeth can tell us if people were shifting to a more sedentary way of living. Stress in bones can tell us about difficult food production techniques such as labor-intensive seed grinding.The past can shape the futureAboriginal culture is 60 millennia old, during which time the climate shifted several times. Sea levels rose, flooding the Bass Strait and the coastal plains connecting Cape York to Papua New Guinea.For a culture to survive that long means it had to rely on sustainable food production. Finding out how exactly this was done could yield lost knowledge and make it possible for current-day Aboriginal groups to recapture these methods and crops.To date, renewed interest in bushfoods has not spread far beyond boutique food industries such as gourmet breads and specialized plant foods like Kakadu plum and quandongs.Learning more about drought-resilient crops such as native rice and native millet (Panicum decompositum) could help farmers adapt to climate change and diversify food production. In central Victoria, the Dja Dja Wurrung group is exploring the potential for kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra) for use as a food and as drought-resistant cattle fodder.The better we understand ancient food production, the more likely we are to be able to bring this knowledge to bear on today's challenges—and give a fuller answer to the questions raised by Dark Emu.","['australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'papuanewguinea', 'papuanewguinea']",gb,False,False

One craft brewery that gets some of their hops from Goschie said that the company is trying to replicate the flavors of German hops using new varieties grown in the U.S. because the ones they depend upon from Europe have been impacted by hot, dry summers over the last couple of years.That's why some researchers are working on varieties of hops that can better withstand summer heat, warmer winters, changing pests and diseases and less snowfall, which could mean less available irrigation, said Shaun Townsend, an associate professor and senior researcher at Oregon State University. Townsend is working on a project where he subjects hops to drought stress to eventually create more drought-tolerant varieties.It's no easy task, one that can take a decade, and one that also has to take into account brewers' main considerations, taste and yield. But the possibility of running out of water is a reality that's on people's radars, he said.Better hops might still be a technology that's a work in progress, but the story of barley improvements is already well underway. Kevin Smith, professor of agronomy andplant geneticsat the University of Minnesota, said that while spring barley is the dominant type for the U.S. beer industry, winter barley—which is planted in the fall and kept on fields during the coldest months of the year—may be more feasible now in the Midwest, where other barley types had been given up due to climate, plant disease and economic factors in favor of crops that are less risky.Winter barley may also be desirable for craft breweries that have started emphasizing local ingredients and who want something grown close by. And it can also be grown as a cover crop, meaning that farmers can prevent erosion, improve their soil health and keep carbon stored in the ground by planting it during the off-season when fields are normally bare.But there hasn't always been complete consensus on the promise of winter barley. Smith told a story about his predecessor, who was a longtime spring barley breeder. Another scientist—Patrick Hayes, a professor at Oregon State University—was describing to him his hopes for the future of winter barley. Smith's predecessor wrote on abusiness card, ""it can't be done,"" referring to his firm belief that winter barley just wasn't worth the trouble.Hayes kept the card in his office, and has made it his life's mission to work on improving winter barley.There are now winter barley programs at nearly every state in the country, said Ashley McFarland, the vice president and technical director of the American Malting Barley Association. She doesn't think winter barley will ever be the entirety of the crop in the U.S., but says that producers will need to diversify their risk in order to be more resilient to climate shocks.Molson Coors and Anheuser Busch, the two biggest beer companies in the U.S., issue annual environmental reports that pledge commitments to sustainably sourcing hops and barley and reducing water usage, but neither company responded to an Associated Press request for comment on the specifics of those efforts.Hops can be a finicky crop when it comes to their climate, and without water, you simply can't make beer, said Douglass Miller, senior lecturer at Cornell who teaches a class on beer. He added that the price of beer might rise due toclimate impactson the supply chain—but so will the price of everything else on the menu. ""All beverage categories are being impacted by this,"" he said.No matter what farmers and companies do with hops andwinterbarley, climate change may affect what beer-lovers are able to buy in the future.""It will be increasingly difficult for us as plant breeders to provide new varieties ofbarleyand new varieties of hops that can meet, just, all of the terrors of theclimatechange process,"" Hayes said.

No one was injured and no homes burned in the latest fire, which scorched mountain ridges on Oahu, but the flames wiped out irreplaceable native forestland that's home to nearly two dozen fragile species. And overall, the ingredients are the same as they were in Maui's historic town of Lahaina: severe drought fueled by climate change is creating fire inHawaiiwhere it has almost never been before. “It was really beautiful native forest,” said JC Watson, the manager of the Koolau Mountains Watershed Partnership, which helps take care of the land. He recalled it had uluhe fern, which often dominate Hawaii rainforests, and koa trees whose wood has traditionally been used to make canoes, surfboards and ukuleles. “It’s not a full-on clean burn, but it is pretty moonscape-looking out there,” Watson said. The fact that this fire was on Oahu’s wetter, windward side is a “red flag to all of us that there is change afoot,” said Sam ’Ohu Gon III, senior scientist and cultural adviser at The Nature Conservancy in Hawaii. The fire mostly burned inside the Oahu Forest National Wildlife Refuge, which is home to 22 species listed as endangered or threatened by the U.S. government. They include iiwi and elepaio birds, a tree snail called pupu kani oe and the Hawaiian hoary bat, also known as opeapea. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge, does not know yet what plants or wildlife may have been damaged or harmed by the fire, spokesperson Kristen Oleyte-Velasco said. The fire incinerated 2.5 square miles (6.5 square kilometers) since first being spotted on Oct. 30 and was 90% contained as of Friday. Officials were investigating the cause of the blaze roughly 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Honolulu. The flames left gaping, dark bald spots amid a blanket of thick green where the fire did not burn. The skeletons of blackened trees poked from the charred landscape. The burn area may seem relatively small compared to wildfires on the U.S. continent, which can raze hundreds of square miles. But Hawaii's intact native ecosystems aren't large to begin with, especially on smaller islands like Oahu, so even limited fires have far-reaching consequences. One major concern is what plants will grow in place of the native forest. Hawaii’s native plants evolved without encountering regular fires and fire is not part of their natural life cycle. Faster-growing non-native plants with more seeds tend to sprout in place of native species afterward. Watson said an Oahu forest near the latest fire had uluhe ferns, koa trees and ohia trees before a blaze burned less than a square mile of it 2015. Now the land features invasive grasses that are more fire-prone, and some slow-growing koa. A much larger 2016 fire in the Waianae mountains on the other side of Oahu took out one of the last remaining populations of a rare tree gardenia, said Gon. There are cultural losses when native forest burns. Gon recalled an old Central Oahu story about a warrior who was thrown off a cliff while battling an enemy chief. His fall was stopped by an ohia tree, another plant common in the incinerated area. Feathers from Hawaii's forest birds were once used to make cloaks and helmets worn by chiefs. Watson's organization is coordinating with the Fish and Wildlife Service to conduct initial surveys of the damage. They'll devise a restoration plan that will include invasive species control and planting native species. But there are limits to what can be done. “It’ll never be able to be returned to its previous state within our lifetimes,"" Watson said. “It's forever changed, unfortunately.” The Mililani Mauka fire — named after the area near where the fire began — burned in the Koolau mountains. These mountains are on Oahu's wetter, windward side because they trap moisture and rain that move across the island from the northeast. But repeated and more prolonged episodes of drought are making even the Koolaus dry. Gon expects more frequent Koolau fires in the future. “There has been a huge uptick in the last 10 years, largely in Waianae range, which is the western and drier portion of the island,” Gon said. “But now we’re seeing fires in the wet section of the island that normally doesn’t see any fires at all.” Hawaii fires are almost always started by humans so Gon said more needs to be done to raise awareness about prevention. Native forests could be further protected with buffer zones by planting less flammable vegetation in former sugarcane and pineapple plantation lands often found at lower elevations, he said. Many of these now-fallow fields sprout dry, invasive grasses. Such grasses fueled the blaze that raced across Lahaina in August, highlighting their dangers. The cause of that fire is still being investigated, but it may have been sparked by downed power lines that ignited dry grass. Winds related to a powerful hurricane passing to the south helped spread the blaze, which destroyed more than 2,000 buildings and homes for some 8,000 people. The fire is likely to affect Oahu’s fresh water supply, though this is challenging to measure. Oahu’s 1 million residents and visitors get their drinking water from aquifers, but it usually takes decades for rain to seep through the ground to recharge them. Native forests are the best at absorbing rain so the disappearance of high-quality forest is certain to have some effect, Watson said. State officials are seeking additional funding from the Legislature next year for updated firefighting equipment, firebreaks, new water sources for fire suppression, replanting native trees and plants, and seed storage. Firefighters and rain last week finally tamped down the Oahu blaze, but Gon urged action now “to make sure that it doesn’t turn into yearly fires nibbling away at the source of our water supply.”","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'italy']",us,True,True

New Delhi, India –For years, Pravin Tambe, a leg-spinner from a middle-class family in Mumbai, toiled away in company and club teams with the singular goal of playing first-class cricket. He kept going, even as he aged and other players began to refer to him as “uncle”. Then in 2013, at the age of 41, he was discovered and signed by former Indian captain Rahul Dravid to play for a professional franchise cricket team. In the 2014 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), while playing for Rajasthan Royals, Tambe took a hat-trick against Kolkata Knight Riders and was named man of the match. He went to the dressing room and wept. His story was dramatised in the 2022 Bollywood biopic Kaun Pravin Tambe? (Who is Pravin Tambe?), whose character was played by actor Shreyas Talpade. When Talpade auditioned for the role, his career was not going well. “I was told that some people weren’t sure whether I’d be able to pull it off,” Talpade, now 47, told Al Jazeera. He practised hard to convincingly play the leg-spinner from the ages of 20 to 41. His body ached, and one evening when he was feeling particularly low, Talpade and his wife watched Iqbal, his 2005 Bollywood film. In Iqbal, Talpade played the fictional lead character, a deaf and mute village boy obsessed with playing cricket for India. Despite Iqbal’s disability, his father’s disapproval and no formal training, he persisted and, as happens in all good sports films, human spirit and grit triumph in the climactic sequence. “[I watched it] just as a reminder – not only about the story of this guy, but also to myself – that I’ve done this before and I can do it again,” he said. Talpade triumphed too. He got to play Tamble, and cricket transcended from being just a sport to become – as many Indians say – a “metaphor for life”. People still come up to Talpade to tell him that when they are “feeling down,” they often watch Iqbal. “The underdog factor is probably the crux. It’s very high on energy and motivation,” says Talpade. The story of Indian cricket is the story of India, of Talpades and Iqbals, of men and women struggling with poverty, caste, class and gender discrimination, yet rising from gully cricket to play for the country – which is hosting the 2023Cricket World Cup. Bollywood, India’s “dream machine”, has always reflected the mood of the nation by drawing inspiration from real life – including from cricket, although it has had a rocky relationship with the sport. “Cricket and cinema really are two religions in this country,” says Kabir Khan, one of Bollywood’s top directors whose last film, titled 83, was about India winning the World Cup for the first time in 1983. “Having said that, we probably should have had more cricket films.” Bollywood’s love affair with cricket began on a sticky wicket in the late 1950s, when a black and white film, Love Marriage, was released. That was a time when cricket was played professionally only in its longest form – Tests – over five days. Though the game and cricketers were very popular, the slow pace of Test cricket did not particularly lend itself to on-screen drama. Love Marriage was about love, but it cast cricket as cupid, making the young heroine fall for her dashing tenant when he scores a century. For several years after Love Marriage, there was no cricket on the silver screen. But in the 1970s, when India beat England in England, and the West Indies in the West Indies – where batsman Sunil Gavaskar, having scored 774 runs in his debut Test series, was celebrated with a calypso song – cricketers became stars and even began appearing in films. Gavaskar sang, danced and screamed “I love you” in a Marathi language film, and Salim Durani, a dashing Afghan-born Indian all-rounder known for hitting boundaries on fans’ demand, was cast as the romantic lead in a rather dreary Bollywood film, titled Charitra (Character). Although these films did not do well at the box office, Bollywood began warming up to the idea of releasing cricket-related films around big tournaments and wins to cash in on the cricket craze. In the 1980s, after Indiawon their first World Cup, two cricketers from the winning squad were cast in a Bollywood film: batsman Sandeep Patil played the romantic interest of two women in a film, titled Kabhie Ajnabi The (We Were Strangers Once), with wicketkeeper Syed Kirmani playing a baddie. In the same decade, two terribly tacky films, whose fictional plot involved a rivalry between cricketers, were also released. One was a romantic melodrama, and the other, Awwal Number (Number One), was plain bizarre. Its climactic sequence involved two helicopters and a cricketer, miffed at being dropped, trying to blow up a pitch where an India vs Australia match was under way. “The cricket [in these films] was lame,” Vasan Bala, a Bollywood writer-director, told Al Jazeera. “Growing up, we just knew that cricket and Bollywood never work. It was a completely jinxed thing.” One film changed that. Lagaan: Once Upon A Time In India, directed by Ashutosh Gowarikar withBollywood star Aamir Khanin the lead, was released in 2001. It was a massive hit and was nominated in the Best Foreign Film category at the Academy Awards. Lagaan did not win, but it broke the jinx at home. It also split India’s cricket-in-cinema story into two – the drought before Lagaan, and the deluge after. Set in the 1890s during the British Raj, in an Indian village that is reeling under drought and heavy taxation, the story of Lagaan (Tax) was not just about cricket. It was about colonial injustice, caste discrimination and moral conviction. The film’s fictional story took inspiration from the first “all-Indian” cricket team that toured England in 1911. The three-hour-and-38-minute long film was about what a ragtag team of poor villagers — Hindus, including, a disabled Dalit man with a natural spin, a Sikh, and a Muslim — do after a British officer challenges them to a game of cricket: “Beat us and no tax will be levied for two years. But if you lose, the tax will be tripled.” It was a classic David versus Goliath story with a bit of romance and nationalistic fervour thrown in. “Lagaan was a very clever film … I remember watching it in a theatre where the entire cinema hall became a stadium,” said director and cricket buff Srijit Mukherji, whose biographical drama on Mithali Raj, a former captain of Indian women’s cricket team, released last year. Lagaan came a year after cricket had suffered a devastating blow. In a shocking match-fixing scandal, then-India captain Mohammad Azharuddin was implicated along with others. The skipper, whose graceful batting and popped collar once stood for stylish integrity, had betrayed fans and tainted cricket. “In Lagaan, the excitement was not about cricket. The excitement was about watching characters whose life depends on this game,” Bala says. Lagaan’s motley crew of cricketers went some way to restoring faith in the game and spawned a whole new generation of cricket films, including several lookalikes in Bollywood and regional cinema that were set in small towns and gully tournaments. Many were forgettable, but a few stood out. As well as Iqbal, there was MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, released in 2016. Starring Sushant Singh Rajput as the eponymous lead, Dhoni, and directed by one of Bollywood’s leading directors, Neeraj Pandey, it is a biopic of India’s former captain, Mahinder Singh Dhoni. It follows his journey from working as a ticket checker at a small railway station in a dusty town to leading India to win their second World Cup in 2011. A less popular box office film, but no less influential, was 83. “A sports film is good only when it’s a good underdog story. And 1983 was a classic story of the underdog,” says director Kabir Khan. “I don’t think anything can ever be as exciting as 83 because post-83, we were never the underdogs.” His 2021 feature film on India’s ascent to becoming world champions in England in 1983, at a time when British bookies were reportedly offering 50:1 against them, is a homage not just to an iconic tournament that is etched in India’s collective memory, ball-for-ball, wicket-to-wicket, but also to the moment at Lord’s when captain Kapil Dev raised the World Cup trophy and cricket shed its colonial legacy and became a part of India’s national identity. “India is a country where everyone is a self-styled cricket pundit and they’re ready to give evenSachin Tendulkartips on batting. My goal was to make a film where nobody could stand up and say, ‘This doesn’t look like the original,’” Khan said. Khan’s team spent about two years researching the tournament, even managing to recreate a match – in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where Kapil Dev scored 175 not-out against Zimbabwe – for which no footage existed. Actors trained for months, and Ranveer Singh, one of Bollywood’s leading stars who played Kapil Dev, spent two weeks with the former captain; not just learning to walk, talk and play like him, but to also embody his peculiar style of reticent, gentle swagger. In 83, cricket was stellar. But this cinematic coup came with a pricey tag. Made on a budget of $34m, 83 is one of the most expensive films ever made in India. Critics praised the film, but four days after its release in December 2021, theatres in India began to shut down due to the third wave of COVID and the film was a box office flop. But 83 set a new benchmark for cricket films and fired up many cinematic ambitions. Bollywood has released five cricket films after 83, including Srijit Mukherji’s Shabaash Mithu, which traces Mithali Raj’s journey from a small town to leading India’s women’s cricket team to the final at the 2017 Women’s World Cup, which they lost to England. “They lost the battle but they won the war against misogyny, against discrimination, against the sorry state of affairs of women’s cricket and inspired an entire generation of girls and women to pick up the sport,” Mukherji said. There is authenticity in Shabaash Mithu’s cricketing action, but it flopped, as did all the other films. The jinx seems to be back. Or, perhaps, genteel nostalgia and the underdog story no longer have resonance in a country that has changed. In the sequel to every David versus Goliath story, David becomes Goliath. India is now one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and acricket powerhousein terms of viewership and revenue. Meanwhile, aggressive Hindu supremacism has soared since the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014. “Cricket and cinema are the last bastions of secularism, but they are also a reflection of our society,” writer-director Varun Grover said. TheIndia vs PakistanCricket World Cup match held in October was a blockbuster. Watched by 35 million viewers on Disney+Hotstar and more than 100,000 people in the stadium, for which tickets were reportedly sold for as high as 5,700,000 rupees ($69,170), the match was won by India. But the crowds at Gujarat’s Narendra Modi Stadium,named after India’s prime minister, chanted “Jai Shri Ram” – a rallying cry of right-wing Hindus hailing a warrior God – as a taunt to Pakistani cricketers. Another Bollywood film, titled Hukus Bukus, after a popular Kashmiri folk song, was released on November 3. Set in Kashmir, it is a fictional story about a Hindu man desperately trying to build a temple dedicated to Hindu God Krishna in thecontested Muslim-majority region, but he is up against Muslim politicians with vested interests. His son, a Tendulkar fan, plays a cricket match to get land for the temple. “Films reflect society and its inflexions,” says Mukherji, “and cricket films are no different.” Follow Al Jazeera English:","['india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'not found', 'not found', 'not found', 'not found', 'not found', 'not found', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'australia', 'srilanka', 'srilanka', 'zimbabwe']",us,False,False

However, the Earth was very different more than 300 million years ago during the Carboniferous period, when ferns were the dominant flora, with towering tree ferns dominating the ecological landscape. Most of the coal resources on Earth today came from fern plants of that period, hence the name Carboniferous.However, paleontological research reveals a turning point at the end of the Carboniferous period, with Earth's climate suddenly becoming cold and arid. As a result, ferns began to decline, paving the way for the rise of seed plants. Nevertheless, this significant evolutionary event is marked by many unsolved mysteries, with one of the most important mysteries being: What specific advantages did seed plants evolve that allowed them to transition from a weaker position to a thriving one by the end of the Carboniferous period?Roots are essential organs for absorbing and transporting water and mineral nutrients in plants, and the endodermis is the core of the root, controlling water and mineral transport. The endodermis cell wall features a hydrophobic, lignin-based Casparian strip tightly anchored to the endodermal cell membrane, thus forming a barrier to prevent the free diffusion of substances. Additionally, the suberin lamellae are specialized cell wall structures that envelop the entire surface of endodermal cells.Research indicates that both the Casparian strip and suberin lamellae play essential roles in plant nutrient balance and water transport, but their functions are significantly different. Chao's group had previously made breakthroughs in understanding the formation and anchoring of the Casparian strip. However, the evolutionary basis of suberin lamellae and their role in plant evolution had not yet been resolved.This study used a series of advanced cell biology and analytical chemistry techniques to conduct in-depth research on representative plant species from 18 different evolutionary nodes with the aim of unveiling the secrets of the origin of the Casparian strip and suberin lamellae.Surprisingly, the researchers found that the Casparian strip exists in allvascular plants, including ferns, lycophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms, while suberin lamellae are only present in gymnosperms and angiosperms (both collectively referred to as seed plants).This evidence suggests that the Casparian strip and suberin lamellae did not originate simultaneously; the former emerged from the common ancestor of all vascular plants, while the latter evolved in the common ancestor of seed plants. This finding challenges the longstanding assumption regarding suberin lamellae and offers new perspectives for studying the evolution of these structures.To investigate how suberin lamellae evolved in the common ancestor of seed plants, the researchers conducted molecular evolutionary analyses of the genes involved in suberin lamellae formation and their homologs, with these results: Although most of these genes had evolved before the appearance of vascular plants, significant expansion occurred in the common ancestor of seed plants.This expansion suggested thatgene duplicationlikely led to functional innovations, thus enabling the genes responsible for synthesizing suberin lamellae to emerge in the common ancestor of seed plants.To confirm this hypothesis, the researchers investigated homologous genes of the core MYB transcription factors involved in suberin formation in fern plants, lycophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. These genes were found to be widespread in all these plant groups. However, a significant expansion of homologous genes occurred in the common ancestor of gymnosperms and angiosperms.The researchers revealed that the expanded homologous genes in gymnosperms and angiosperms could initiate suberin lamellae formation, while the homologous genes in fern plants and lycophyte plants had no such function. This finding confirmed that the function of MYB transcription factors initiating suberin synthesis was acquired in seed plants through gene expansion.As Earth's climate became dry in the late Carboniferous period, ferns began to decline and seed plants increased. Since suberin has waterproof properties, the researchers hypothesized that the emergence of suberin lamellae might have contributed to the drought adaptability of seed plants, thus promoting their rise after the onset of arid conditions. They later confirmed this hypothesis by using two Arabidopsis genetic materials with suberin defects, thereby demonstrating that suberin-deficient Arabidopsis was more sensitive to drought.Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy andnuclear magnetic resonancerevealed the crucial significance of suberin lamellae in enhancing the efficiency of vascular water transport. Specifically, since water molecules are capable of free diffusion across cell membranes in the absence of suberin lamellae, plants without suberin lamellae, such as ferns and horsetails, experience significant water leakage from endodermal cell membranes when subjected to osmotic stress, resulting in low transport efficiency.Seed plants, with suberin lamellae fully enveloping their endodermal cells, almost completely block the free diffusion ofwater molecules. Thus, their water leakage rate under osmotic stress is only 1%–2% compared to fern plants and lycophyte plants. This waterproofing effect greatly enhances the efficiency of water transport in the vascular tissues of seed plants under drought conditions, thereby increasing their drought resistance.Based on this, the researchers proposed a model for the rise of seed plants: In the moist climate of the Carboniferous period, fern plants with no suberin lamellae had higher water and nutrient absorption efficiency and were better adapted to the environment, thus causing them to thrive.However, during the late Carboniferous period, the onset of a dry climate provided an advantage forseedplants that had evolved suberin lamellae. They possessed a more efficientwater transportsystem and stronger drought tolerance, allowing them to gradual replace ferns and become the dominant life forms on Earth's surface.This study not only unveils the mystery of the origin of the Casparian strip and suberin lamellae but also provides evidence, for the first time, that the emergence of suberin lamellae drove the rise ofseed plants, based on a new perspective. Furthermore, it identifies the important role of suberin lamellae in plant adaptation to adverse conditions such as drought. As a result, this study has significant implications for enhancing plant drought resistance, elucidating plant salt and drought tolerance mechanisms, and developing drought-resistant crop varieties.",[],gb,False,False

The Colorado River was thecentral focus of treaty negotiationsbecause officials believed the Colorado basin would have moreeconomic activityand population growth, so it would need more water. In fact, however, the Rio Grande basin has also seen significant growth.For the Rio Grande, the treaty allocates specific shares of water to the U.S. and Mexico from both the river's main stem and its tributaries in Texas and Mexico. Delivery of water from six Mexican tributaries has become the source of contention. One-third of this flow is allocated to the U.S., and must total some 76 million cubic feet (2.2 million cubic meters) over each five-year period.The treaty allows Mexico to roll any accrued deficits at the end of a five-year cycle over to the next cycle. Deficits can only be rolled over once, and they must be made up along with the required deliveries for the following five-year period.The Rio Grande is one of the largest rivers in the southwest U.S. and northern Mexico. Because of drought and overuse, sections of the river frequently run dry. Credit:Kmusser/Wikipedia,CC BY-SAThese five-year periods, called cycles, are numbered. Cycles 25 (1992-1997) and 26 (1997-2002) were the first time that two consecutive cycles ended in deficit. Like the Colorado River, the Rio Grandehas become over-allocated: The 1944 treaty promises users more water than there is in the river. The main causes arepersistent droughtand increased water demand on both sides of the border.Much of this demand was generated bythe 1992 North American Free Trade Agreement, which eliminated most border tariffs between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. From 1993 through 2007, agricultural imports and exports between the U.S. and Mexico quadrupled, and there was extensive expansion ofmaquiladoras—assembly plants along the border. This growth increased water demand.Ultimately, Mexico delivered more than the required amount for Cycle 27 (2002-2007), plus its incurred deficit from cycles 25 and 26, by transferring water from its reservoirs. This outcome appeased Texas users but left Mexico vulnerable. Since then, Mexico has continued to struggle to meet its treaty responsibilities and has experienced chronic water shortages.In 2020, a confrontation erupted in the state of Chihuahua between the Mexican National Guard and farmers who believed delivery to Texas of water from the Rio Conchos—one of the six tributaries regulated under the 1944 treaty—threatened their survival. In 2022, people lined up at water distribution sites inthe Mexican city of Monterrey, where the population had doubled since 1990. As of 2023, halfway through Cycle 36, Mexico has only deliveredsome 25% of its targeted amount.Border politics overshadow water shortagesAs climate change makes the Southwest hotter and drier, scientists predict thatwater shortages on the Rio Grande will intensify. In this context, the 1944 treaty pits humanitarian needs for water in the U.S. against those in Mexico.It also pits the needs of different sectors against one another. Agriculture is thedominant water consumerin the region, followed by residential use. When there is a drought, however, the treaty prioritizes residential water use over agriculture.The Rio Grande is affected by nearly the same hydroclimate conditions as the Colorado River, which flows mainly through the southwest U.S. but ends in Mexico. However, drought and water shortages in the Colorado River basin receive much more public attention than the same problems on the Rio Grande. U.S. media outlets cover the Rio Grande almost exclusively when it figures in stories about immigration and river crossings, such as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's 2023 decision to installfloating barriersin the river at widely used crossing points.Farmers as far north as Colorado rely on water from the Rio Grande for irrigation.The compact that governs use of Colorado River water has widely recognized flaws: The agreement is 100 years old, allocates more rights to water than the river holds, and completely excludes Native American tribes. However, negotiations over the Colorado between compact states and the U.S. and Mexico are much more focused than decision-making about Rio Grande water, which has to compete with many other bilateral issues.Adapting to the futureAs we see it, the 1944 water treaty is inadequate to solve the complex social, economic, hydrological and political challenges that exist today in the Rio Grande basin. We believe it needs revision to reflect modern conditions.This can be done through theminute process, which permits Mexico and the U.S. to adopt legally binding amendments without having to renegotiate the entire agreement. The two countries have already used this process to update the treaty as it pertains to the Colorado Riverin 2012andagain in 2017.These steps allowed the U.S. to adjust its deliveries of Colorado River water to Mexico based on water levels in Lake Mead, the Colorado's largest reservoir, in ways that proportionally distributed drought impacts between the two countries. In the Rio Grande basin, Mexico does not have similar flexibility.The U.S. also has the ability to proportionally reduce deliveries under aseparate 1906 agreementthat outlines water delivery from El Paso to Ciudad Juarez. In 2013, for example,Mexico received only 6%of the water it was due under the 1906 Convention.Enabling Mexico to proportionally reduce Rio Grande deliveries according to drought conditions would distribute drought andclimate changeimpacts more fairly between both countries. As we see it, this kind of cooperation would deliver human, ecological and political benefits in a complex and contentious region.","['us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'cc', 'not found', 'not found', 'not found', 'canada']",gb,False,False

""Children Displaced in a Changing Climate"", a joint report by UNICEF and the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center in partnership with the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, is a first-of-its-kind data analysis that shows 43 million children were forced to leave their homes in the past six years (2016-2022) — the equivalent of about 20,000 children every day — mainly due to floods and storms, but also droughts and wildfires. In Legazpi city, Albay province, the Philippines, on Nov. 11, 2020, families sheltered inside a school as Typhoon Vamco (known locally as Ulysses) bore down. yphoon Gona (Rolly) had devastated the area the week before. The island nation's location and geography make it prone to storms and floods. More than half of all child displacements from 2016 to 2022 happened in the Philippines, India and China. UNICEF report includes the first data set to focus on children Up until now, with previous data on displacement rarely distinguishing by age, these children have been statistically invisible. In places where there are other issues, like rapid urbanization, conflict and insecurity, the report notes, children on the move are even more likely to slip through the cracks. Researchers used data modeling to quantify past displacements and to project where children are likely to be displaced next. The risks of climate-related displacement are highest for children and families in countries like Mozambique, where there are limited capacities for coping with the fallout of storms and floods. Above, Francelina Antonio holding one of her two small children, took shelter at a school after the family's home was destroyed by strong winds and flooding caused by Cyclone Freddy. The report also identifies countries where a high risk of weather-related child displacement is compounded by factors such ashigh rates of poverty, conflict and other hazards — and where efforts toward risk mitigation and disaster preparedness work will be most critical. Children and communities are especially vulnerable in countries like Haiti and Mozambique, where the risk of weather disasters is high but capacities for coping with them are limited. Pakistan continues to suffer the effects of catastrophic flooding caused by record rainfall during the 2022 monsoons. Many families remain in temporary settlements, and many damaged schools remain closed. Above, a UNICEF-supported temporary learning center next to the floodwater in village Allah Dina Channa, Lasbela district, Baluchistan province. The many ways children who are displaced can suffer Displacement – whether short-lived or protracted, reactive or preemptive – can multiply climate-related risks for children and their families. In the aftermath of a disaster, children may become separated from their parents or caregivers, amplifying risks of exploitation, child trafficking and abuse. Displacement can also disrupt access to safe water, sanitation and health care, including essential vaccines, magnifying children's risk of disease. Schooling is often disrupted as well, jeopardizing children's futures. And displaced children and families don't necessarily end up in areas that are any less vulnerable to climate shocks. A young boy pulls a load of timber through a flooded field in Bentiu, Unity State, South Sudan, on Feb. 27, 2023. South Sudan and Somalia were the two countries with the greatest number of children displaced by flooding. Where in the world is this happening the most? In relative terms, Small Island Developing States and countries in the Horn of Africa are the most affected. Dominica, Saint Maarten, Northern Mariana Islands, Saint Martin, Cuba and Vanuatu recorded the most child displacements from storms, according to the report. South Sudan and Somalia experienced the greatest number of child displacements from floods — and both implement and record far fewer preemptive evacuations, suggesting children living in these hotspot locations are even more vulnerable. Hamza, 5, lives with his family in Lusharbak village, in Gulran district, western Afghanistan, an area affected by severe drought since 2020. Drought triggered more than 1.3 million internal displacements of children across 15 countries between 2016 and 2021. More than half — 730,000 — were recorded in Somalia, another 340,000 in Ethiopia and 190,000 in Afghanistan. Researchers caution that these numbers are likely to be radically underreported, due to the slow onset nature of the situation and poor reporting and monitoring mechanisms. Over the next 30 years, they project, tens of millions more children will be displaced by river flooding than cyclone winds or storm surges. Regions at highest risk are South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Read the full report. UNICEF’s call to climate action: protect, prepare and prioritize children Climate change factors into everything UNICEF does for children. The urgent need for communities and countries to adapt to and mitigate climate impacts and build resilience touches virtually every UNICEF program, from water and sanitation to health, nutrition, education and protection. Climate considerations are an integral part of UNICEF's emergency response and recovery work. With the release of the ""Children Displaced"" report, UNICEF repeated its call for global community to take action to better protect children and young people, and to better prepare them to live in a climate-changed world. Khadijo Mohamed Aden, a mother of four and farmer from Dinsoor, a town in the Bay region of Somalia, sits with her daughter Sabirin, 2, outside their makeshift home at the Gurman camp for internally displaced persons outside Mogadishu. Drought forced the family to leave home in search of food and water. Sabirin was treated for severe acute malnutrition at a UNICEF-supported health center. To improve outcomes for children and young people at risk of future displacement, UNICEF urges governments, donors, development partners and the private sector to ensure that child-critical services — education, health, social protection, child protection — are shock-responsive, portable and inclusive. Policies and solutions must prioritize their needs. And children and young people must be given opportunities to participate in climate action. UNICEF works with governments in regions and countries that are most at risk of climate-related displacements and other impacts to better prepare for and minimize those risks, develop and implement child-sensitive climate adaptation strategies, and design resilient and portable services to reach the most vulnerable children before, during and after disaster strikes. A young student inside a UNICEF-supported temporary learning center set up in Saleh Shah, Sindh province, Pakistan, for children impacted by the 2022 floods. Climate-induced flooding also hit Bangladesh, northern India and Afghanistan that year. Children suffer the most in climate-related crises — with those in the poorest communities bearing the biggest burden.

The issue affects a third of the Earth’s land surface,according to the United Nations,parchingparts of Africa, South America, southern Europe, China and a third of US soil. Reclaiming arid land and turning it back into agricultural fields could be key to ensuring we are able to feed the planet’s population. Sand to Green is a Moroccan startup that can transform a patch of desert into a sustainable and profitable plantation in five years, according to Wissal Ben Moussa, its co-founder and chief agricultural officer. “Desertification is the future of a lot of countries today,” she says. “Our solution is using agroforestry to create a new kind of agriculture that is sustainable and that can be resilient in front of climate change.” The system can be deployed anywhere near a source of brackish water, which Sand to Green desalinates using solar-powered technology. It then plants a variety of fruit-producing trees and herbs in the same space — a practice known as intercropping — and drip-irrigates their roots directly with the desalinated water, to minimize evaporation. The soil is regenerated using what Sand to Green calls “green manure,” a mixture that includes compost, biochar and microorganisms that help the soil “wake up,” according toBen Moussa. Biochar is a form of charcoal that can help arid soils retain water. This allows some herbs to be ready for harvest after just two years. In a five-hectare trial in southern Morocco that’s been running since 2017, Sand to Green has tried out a variety of plants in search of the best perfomers. “My top three favorite trees are carob, fig and pomegranate,” Ben Moussa says. “They are endemic to the regions where we want to deploy, have high added value when it comes to the produce, but they are also very resilient.” Among the intercropping herbs that have been successfully trialed are rosemary, geranium, vetiver and citronella, which Ben Moussa describes as “very low-maintenance and very high-margin.” A 2018 reviewby the UN Convention to Combat Desertification found that the global economy was set tolose $23 trillion by 2050 because of land degradation, whiletaking urgent action would cost only a fraction of that — $4.6 trillion. Land degradation or drought affect 169 countries, with Asia and Africa the hardest-hit. Efforts to grow crops in desert environments are spreading. The International Center for Biosaline Agriculture isgrowing salt-tolerant superfoodsin the sandy soil of Dubai, while in Tanzania, non-profits are usingmounds of earth known as bundsto trap water so that it can penetrate parched ground, allowing grasses to return. Sand to Green is now working to scale up to a 20-hectare commercial proof-of-concept site, also in southern Morocco. It says a site of that size would cost around €450,000 ($475,000) to set up and would start bringing financial returns in about five years. “With this system we create biodiversity, which means better soil, healthier crops and a bigger yield,” Ben Moussa says. “Our plantation can generate 1.5 times more yield and thus more revenue than a monoculture plantation in the same area.” When commercialized, each piece of land will be divided into plantations that will be provided as a “green investment,” Ben Moussa says, with Sand to Green handling every step from inception to fruition.

Countries' climate action plans are still far behind what's needed to curb human-caused warming and limit the devastating effects of extreme heat, storms and droughts, but some nations have taken marginal steps toward slashing emissions, a United Nations analysis of national plans found Tuesday. The report looked into the climate plans of 195 countries and found that emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas will go up 9% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels, but will be 2% lower than 2019 levels because of some climate action from countries switching to cleaner energy. But climate scientists warn that the world needs to spew around 45% less by then. ""The world is failing to get a grip on the climate crisis,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. ""Inch by inch progress will not do. It is time for a climate ambition supernova in every country, city, and sector."" He called for ""net-zero"" — when countries only spew as much carbon into the atmosphere as they can take back out — in developed countries to happen by ""as close as possible"" to 2040, and 2050 for developing nations. The U.N. climate chief, Simon Stiell, urged that upcoming international climate talks in Dubai become a ""turning point"" where governments can get on track with plans to cut emissions in line with capping warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), as agreed by nations in Paris in 2015. ""Governments must not only agree what stronger climate actions will be taken but also start showing exactly how to deliver them,"" Stiell said in a press statement. He said that billions around the world expect governments to act on climate change. Sultan al-Jaber, president of the COP28 climate talks in Dubai and chief of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, said the report shows ""there is simply no time left for delays."" Extreme weather events charged by the warming atmosphere are increasing in magnitude and frequency around the world. The last 12 months were the hottest yearlong period ever recorded, according to a recent analysis. Many recent droughts, floods and storms were found to have fingerprints of human-cause climate change, according to attribution scientists. When countries meet in Dubai, they'll review their climate action for the last three years as part of what's been called a ""global stocktake."" Negotiators plan to use this report and discussions later this year to figure out what nations need to do next to fight climate change. Climate activists said the report is just one more reason why global leaders should be held accountable for their inaction at the talks. ""It's already hell for a lot of people,"" said Disha Ravi, an Indian activist with the youth climate group Fridays for Future, of current extreme weather. ""I sometimes wonder if they (leaders) care about lives at all."" ""Leaders have continued prioritizing profits over the health and safety of our planet and its inhabitants,"" she said.

The report issues a stark warning that extreme events and harmful impacts of climate change that Americans are already experiencing, such as heat waves, wildfires, and extreme rainfall, will worsen as temperatures continue to rise. The Fifth National Climate Assessment, issued every five years, is a definitive breakdown of the latest in climate science coming from 14 different federal agencies, including NOAA, NASA, the EPA, and the National Science Foundation. This year's report is more comprehensive than in previous because climate modeling has improved, and the authors took a more holistic look at physical and social impacts of climate change. ""We also have a much more comprehensive understanding of how climate change disproportionately affects those who've done the least to cause the problem,"" Katherine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and co-author of the report, said in a briefing with reporters. Some communities are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, the report says, warning that Black, Hispanic, and indigenous communities are more likely to face challenges accessing water as droughts become more intense. Climate change also creates more health risks for marginalized communities, according to the report, which says that “systemic racism and discrimination exacerbate” the impacts. The report lays out how every part of the US is being impacted by climate change and that some areas are facing multiple worsening impacts at the same time. For example, western states saw heat waves and wildfires during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which strained resources and added to the risk of severe illness. In the same year, back-to-back storms during the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season are some examples of climate-driven compounding events that caused unprecedented demand on federal emergency response resources. The report detailed some impacts of climate change that are being felt across the U.S., including increased risk of extreme heat and rainfall, among other weather-related events. Other impacts cited werecoastal erosionand threats to coastal communities from flooding; damage to land including wildfires anddamage to forests;warming oceans and damage to ecosystems likecoral reefs;risks from extreme events like fires; heatwaves and flooding, and increased inequality for minority orlow-income communities. Some areas of the U.S. are also seeing more specific impacts, such as more intense droughts in the Southwest. The assessment also notes changes in storm trends as a result of climate change. Heavy snowfall is becoming more common in the Northeast and hurricane trends are changing, with increases in North Atlantic hurricane activity and the intensification of tropical cyclones. 2023 was a record setting year forbillion-dollar climate disastersin the United States, officials noted in a White House briefing last week. The report also highlights some areas of success, saying more action has been taken across the board to reduce emissions and address climate change since the last report in 2018. Greenhouse gas emissions generated by the U.S. have been steadily decreasing since their peak in 2007, even as the energy demand goes up -- mainly due to a vast reduction in the use of coal, according to the report. Efforts to adapt to and respond to climate change need to be more ""transformative,"" the report found. This includes reducing the use of coal, building more wind turbines and electrifying buildings and making more efforts to protect people from the impacts of climate change. Individuals and government leaders should look at the report as a way to help communities across the country mitigate, adapt and become more resilient to the effects of climate change, White House Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi said. The assessment demonstrates ""both a real and profound environmental risk, but also a real and profound economic opportunity,"" Zaidi said. The administration has also noted that adding clean energy jobs is a top priority. The last time the National Climate Assessment was released, then-President Donald Trump said hedid not believe the findings. The 2018 report found that climate change could lead to massive economic loss, especially by vulnerable communities. In addition to theFifth National Climate Assessment, which is U.S.-focused, two global climate reports were also released on Tuesday, analyzing the current state of climate change policy action around the world. UN Climate Changereleased a progress report on climate action ahead of the COP28 conference set to kick off in Dubai on November 30th. The report highlights that progress on global climate action is moving too slow to keep up with the effects of global warming. ""The Global Stocktake report released by UN Climate Change this year clearly shows where progress is too slow. But it also lays out the vast array of tools and solutions put forward by countries. Billions of people expect to see their governments pick up this toolbox and put it to work,"" Simon Stiell, Executive-Secretary of UN Climate Change said. The 2023 State of Climate Actionreportwas also released on Tuesday, highlighting similar concerns that global climate action is not moving fast enough.

TheNational Climate Assessment, which comes out every four to five years, was released Tuesday with details that bring climate change's impacts down to a local level. Overall, it paints a picture of a country warming about 60% faster than the world as a whole, one that regularly gets smacked with costly weather disasters and faces even bigger problems in the future. Since 1970, the Lower 48 states have warmed by 2.5 degrees (1.4 degrees Celsius) and Alaska has heated up by 4.2 degrees (2.3 degrees Celsius), compared to the global average of 1.7 degrees (0.9 degrees Celsius), the report said. But what people really feel is not the averages, but when weather is extreme. With heat waves, drought, wildfire and heavy downpours, “we are seeing an acceleration of the impacts of climate change in the United States,” said study co-author Zeke Hausfather of the tech company Stripe and Berkeley Earth. And that's not healthy. Climate change is ""harming physical, mental, spiritual, and community health and well-being through the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events, increasing cases of infectious and vector-borne diseases, and declines in food and water quality and security,"" the report said. Compared to earlier national assessments, this year’s uses far stronger language and “unequivocally” blames the burning of coal, oil and gas for climate change. Read more:How Psychology Can Help Fight Climate Change—And Climate Anxiety The 37-chapter assessment includes an interactive atlas that zooms down to the county level. It finds that climate change is affecting people’s security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority and Native American communities often disproportionately at risk. In Alaska, which is warming two to three times faster than the global average, reduced snowpack, shrinking glaciers, thawing permafrost, acidifying oceans and disappearing sea ice have affected everything from the state’s growing season, to hunting and fishing, with projections raising questions about whether some Indigenous communities should be relocated. The Southwest is experiencing more drought and extreme heat – including 31 consecutive days this summer whenPhoenix’s daily high temperaturesreached or exceeded 110 degrees – reducing water supplies and increasing wildfire risk. Northeastern cities are seeing more extreme heat, flooding and poor air quality, as well as risks to infrastructure, while drought and floods exacerbated by climate change threaten farming and ecosystems in rural areas. In the Midwest, both extreme drought and flooding threaten crops and animal production, which can affect the global food supply. In the northern Great Plains, weather extremes like drought and flooding, as well as declining water resources, threaten an economy dependent largely on crops, cattle, energy production and recreation. Meanwhile, water shortages in parts of the southern Great Plains are projected to worsen, while high temperatures are expected to break records in all three states by midcentury. In the Southeast, minority and Native American communities -- who may live in areas with higher exposures to extreme heat, pollution and flooding — have fewer resources to prepare for or to escape the effects of climate change. In the Northwest, hotter days and nights that don't cool down much have resulted in drier streams and less snowpack, leading to increased risk of drought and wildfires. The climate disturbance has also brought damaging extreme rain. Hawaii and other Pacific islands, as well as the U.S. Caribbean, are increasingly vulnerable to the extremes of drought and heavy rain as well as sea level rise and natural disaster as temperatures warm. Brown University climate scientist Kim Cobb, who wasn't part of the assessment team, said, “at the center of the report are people — across every region of the country - who have escalating risks associated with climate change as well as clear opportunities for win-win climate action.” The United States will warm in the future about 40% more than the world as a total, the assessment said. The AP calculated, usingothers'global projections, that would slate America to get about 3.8 degrees (2.1 degrees Celsius) hotter by the end of the century. Hotter average temperatures means weather that is even more extreme. “The news is not good, but it is also not surprising,” said University of Colorado's Waleed Abdalati, a former NASA chief scientist who was not part of this report. “What we are seeing is a manifestation of changes that were anticipated over the last few decades.” The 2,200-page report comes after five straight months when the globe set monthly and daily heat records. It comes as the U.S.has set a record with 25 different weatherdisasters this year that caused at least $1 billion in damage. “Climate change is finally moving from an abstract future issue to a present, concrete, relevant issue. It’s happening right now,” said report lead author Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy and a professor at Texas Tech University. Five years ago, when the last assessment was issued, fewer people were experiencing climate change firsthand. Surveys this year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research show that. In September, about 9 in 10 Americans (87%) said they'd experienced at least one extreme weather event in the past five years — drought, extreme heat, severe storms, wildfires or flooding. That was up from 79% who said that in April. Hayhoe said there's also a new emphasis in the assessment on marginalized communities. “It is less a matter ... of what hits where, but more what hits whom and how well those people can manage the impacts,” said University of Colorado's Abdalati, whose saw much of his neighborhood destroyed in the 2021 Marshall wildfire. Biden administration officials emphasize that all is not lost and the report details actions to reduce emissions and adapt to what's coming. Americans on every level of government are “stepping up to meet this moment,” said White House science adviser Arati Prabhakar. “All of these actions, taken together, give us hope because they tell us that we can do big things at the scale that’s required, at the scale that the climate actually notices.” By cleaning up industry, how electricity is made and how transport is powered, climate change can be dramatically reduced. Hausfather said when emissions stops, warming stops, ""so we can stop this acceleration if we as a society get our act together.” But some scientists said parts of the assessment are too optimistic. “The report's rosy graphics and outlook obscure the dangers approaching,” Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson said. “We are not prepared for what's coming.”","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'not found']",us,True,True

The double burden of dwindling availability - and inadequate water for drinking and sanitation services - is compounding the challenge, putting children at even greater risk. The Climate Changed Child - released ahead of the COP28 UN climate change summit later this month in Dubai - throws a spotlight on the threat facing vulnerable children. It provides an analysis of the impacts of three tiers of water security - water scarcity, water vulnerability, and what's termed ""water stress"" (where demand outstrips surface and groundwater supply) It also outlines the myriad ways in which children bear the brunt of the impacts of the climate crisis, including disease, air pollution, and extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. From the moment of conception, child development is impacted by environmental stress factors, the agency said. 'Uniquely vulnerable' For example, children are more likely to suffer from air pollution than adults. ""The consequences of climate change are devastating for children,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. ""Their bodies and minds are uniquely vulnerable to polluted air, poor nutrition and extreme heat. ""Not only is their world changing - with water sources drying up and terrifying weather events becoming stronger and more frequent - so too is their well-being as climate change affects their mental and physical health. Children are demanding change, but their needs are far too often relegated to the sidelines."" According to the report, the largest number of youngsters are exposed in the Middle East and North Africa and South Asia regions - meaning they live in places with limited water resources and high levels of seasonal and interannual variability, ground water decline or drought risk. East Africa: grim outlook for millions going hungry, warns WFP In East Africa, conflict, high food prices and climate shocks continue to leave millions of people not knowing where their next meal will come from, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) warned on Monday. The agency said that as of the end of September 62.6 million in the region were food insecure, with Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan among the ""most severe"" global food crises. All four countries have been experiencing either open conflict or heightened violence, pushing people to flee their homes. Over 18 million people in the region are displaced - including12 million within their countries and five million who have crossed international borders. Inflation over 13% High costs of food and of living persist in East Africa with inflation averaging 13.2 per cent. WFP said that while official inflation rates for war-torn Sudan have not been issued since February, ""they are expected to exceed 300 per cent by the end of the year"". The UN agency stressed that the dire situation is likely to continue through early 2024. The El Niño climate pattern is expected to bring above-normal rainfall through January, which can be a boon for farming; however, WFP warned that severe flooding in low-lying areas of Somalia, Ethiopia and Uganda may threaten crops and livestock, drive further displacement and fuel infectious disease outbreaks. Iraq: UN migration agency welcomes new Yazidi Genocide Memorial In Iraq, the UN migration agency IOM has hailed a new memorial in Sinjar province at a site where scores of Yazidi women were killed by terror group ISIL in 2014 as a ""first step towards recovery"". Built at the request of survivors by Nadia's Initiative - an organization spearheaded by survivor and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Nadia Murad, together with IOM - the memorial pays homage to the resilience and courage of the Yazidis. Over 3,000 were executed and buried in mass graves by ISIL, also known as Daesh, in what the UN has declared a genocide. Ms. Murad, whose own mother was killed at the site, had donated part of her prize to purchase the land that the memorial stands on. 'Survivors law' IOM's chief of mission in Iraq, Giorgi Gigauri, said that a crucial part of the recovery process was timely individual reparations and other transitional justice measures as outlined in the ""Yazidi Survivors Law"" adopted by the Iraqi parliament in 2021. The UN agency worked closely with the Iraqi authorities to develop the law and has been supporting the application process for reparations.

The assessment, produced about every four years, lays out the toll climate change is taking across every region in the United States. This is the fifth one — but for the first time, this year’s report includes chapters dedicated to economic impact and social inequities. As floods, fires, heatwaves, and other calamities tied to climate change intensify, households pay the price with higher costs and worsening environmental injustices. As floods, fires, heatwaves, and other calamities tied to climate change intensify, households pay the price with higher costs and worsening environmental injustices Climate change has created circumstances that the planet hasn’t seen for thousands of years, the report says. Global temperatures have risen faster over the past half-century than they have in at least 2,000 years. That’s led to all sorts of new threats, like the 2021 heatwave that killed more than 1,400 people in the typically temperate Pacific Northwest. And old problems get much bigger, like droughts sucking the Southwest dry. Drought in the Western US is currently more severe than it’s ever been in at least 1,200 years. Since 1980, drought and heatwaves alone have caused more than $320 billion in damages. Extreme weather disasters make up some of the most devastating displays of climate change and are becoming way more common — and more costly. Back in the 1980s, a billion-dollar disaster hit the US once every four months on average (a figure that’s adjusted for inflation). Now, the US has to cope with one every three weeks. Those extreme events come with $150 billion in losses every year, according to the assessment. That’s a “conservative estimate that does not account for loss of life, healthcare-related costs, or damages to ecosystem services,” the report says. Related We only get one planet Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm on cleaning up ‘clean’ energy There are also more insidious ways climate change takes a bite out of the US economy. Consumers have to shell out more money for food and other goods as prices reflect damages caused by climate change. In the Midwest, pests, diseases, and whiplash between wet and dry conditions linked to climate change threaten corn and apple harvests. And climate change has already supercharged 18 major fishery disasters in Alaska “that were especially damaging for coastal Indigenous Peoples, subsistence fishers, and rural communities,” according to the report. None of these challenges are happening in a vacuum. Like pollution, climate disasters disproportionately affect Americans of color, low-income households, and other groups that have been historically marginalized. While 20 to 40 percent of small businesses that shutter after a natural disaster never open their doors again, those owned by women, people of color, and veterans are even more likely to close for good. Flood losses are expected to balloon much faster in communities with a higher proportion of Black residents Flood losses are expected to balloon much faster in communities with a higher proportion of Black residents. Census tracts where at least 20 percent of the population is Black are projected to see average annual losses from floods rise at a rate twice as fast as other census tracks where less than 1 percent of the population is Black. It’s partly a symptom of racist housing policies like redlining that have left certain communities without the infrastructure and resources to cope with hazards brought on by climate change. Formerly redlined neighborhoods can also be around 12 degrees hotter than surrounding areas because of fewer green spaces and more paved surfaces that trap heat. All of these risks grow as long as the US, the world’s biggest oil and gas producer, and other countries keep running on fossil fuels. The world has warmed by a little more than 1 degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution, and the report says 2 degrees of warming would more than double the economic toll from climate change. The US isn’t taking action fast enough to stop that outcome, the report shows. Planet-heating pollution in the US has only fallen by an average of about 1 percent annually since 2005. It needs to drop by more than 6 percent per year to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which commits countries to keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.

The looming question: How do you help people find a safe new place to live?Isaac Kasamani/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The aftermath of a mudslide that ripped through villages on the foothills of Mount Elgon in 2012, killing at least 18 people. The looming question: How do you help people find a safe new place to live? Mount Elgon's red earth slopes are home to hundreds of thousands of people who eke out a living growing coffee and vegetables on small plots cleared from the forest. As climate change has made annual rains ever more intense, the deforested areas have become increasingly prone to deadly mudslides. Now this extinct volcano in Eastern Uganda offers a case study of not just the threat that climate change poses to people in the world's poorest communities – but also a novel potential solution. Uganda's government has taken a number of steps to move people out of harm's way, with limited success. Now the American non-profitGiveDirectly, an aid group known for its research-driven approach, is testing whether a more effective solution is to just give people a sizable cash grant with no strings attached. Their approach, implemented with the endorsement of Uganda's government, is aimed at a seeming contradiction: Many Mount Elgon residents haven't jumped at government offers to re-settle them. Yet, in a recent survey, GiveDirectly found that people are, in fact, desperate to leave. Wasika Mubarak says he and his family barely escaped a 2018 mudslide on Mount Elgon that injured one of his sons, then age 5 and destroyed his home. He says the only place they could afford to move to afterward was just as dangerous.Give Directlyhide caption Take Wasika Mubarak, a young father who was standing just outside his house during a devastating mudslide in 2018. ""I saw a great wave of water rushing down the mountain,"" he recalls, in the local language Lumasaba. ""It was picking up giant boulders. Swallowing houses."" Mubarak says he ran screaming to his wife, who was in the kitchen cooking with both their sons, then age 6 and 5. She grabbed the oldest and raced outside. Before she or Mubarak could go back for the youngest, the water surged past them, blocking the way ""It took us two hours to reach my son,"" says Mubarak. ""He had been hit with a rock and was bleeding from the head."" The boy recovered. But for Mubarak, what happened in the years that followed has felt almost as scary. With their home destroyed, the only new place they could afford to move to seemed just as dangerous. ""It's also right on the mountain,"" says Mubarak. ""And there are cracks in the ground around it. So we've been living in fear that at any time another landslide could kill us."" To understand why previous efforts to help people like Mubarak have not solved the problem, GiveDirectly's global research director Miriam Laker-Oketta gives the example of a government plan developed after a mudslide in 2010 that killed more than 300 people. Officials bought agricultural land in an alternative location for people to move to. ""It looks like a really great idea,"" says Laker-Oketta. "" 'Let's move these people to this place that is not yet overpopulated. Give them larger pieces of land than they have currently.' "" But she says before long, many people seemed to have returned to Mount Elgon. ""The fact is that people did not want to move to those places."" Officials have been slow to build promised new housing there. Droughts have cut into annual harvests. But also, the new plots were 230 miles east, in a part of the country with a different language, different traditions – where people lacked the connections that help them survive. Most significantly, says Laker-Oketta, it was a top-down solution – a problem that has undermined other attempts to help people in Mount Elgon and likely elsewhere too. ""As human beings we all want agency — the ability to make decisions based on what we believe is important for us,"" says Laker-Oketta. ""And I think that the big gap was [not] going to the people and trying to understand from them, 'What do you want to do?' "" One way to do that, she says, is to just give them cash grants that they can use however they see fit. Indeed, this is the insight that prompted GiveDirectly's founders to start the charity. For more than a decade they've been giving out no strings cash grants across the globe to help lift people out of extreme poverty. And so, says Laker-Oketta, it seemed a natural next step to see if the approach can also help people protect themselves from climate change – specifically by trying it out with the residents of Mount Elgon. First the nonprofit surveyed them to ask, ""How much money would you need to relocate to a new set-up of your choice?"" ""We got an approximate figure of $1,800,"" says Laker-Oketta. Then GiveDirectly started handing out no-strings grants in exactly that amount to about 4,000 households on the mountain. The results should be available by early next year. Charles Kenny, a senior analyst with the think tank Center for Global Development, who is not involved with GiveDirectly's efforts, says the project could have implications for poor people all over the world who live in the path of predictable climate disasters. This includes those residing in other mudslide zones – for instance in Rwanda and Bangladesh. But it could also help people residing on riverbanks prone to deadly flooding in Mozambique and Nigeria, or on farmland across sub-saharan Africa that's being rendered all but unusable by drought, or on islands ravaged by cyclones. Right now, argues Kenny, too much of climate aid is being spent on projects aimed at preventingfurtherclimate change, such as helping countries shift to renewable energy in order to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions. ""But the thing about climate change is it's having an impact now,"" says Kenny. ""And where it's having an impact is in the world's poorest countries. These people need help today to deal with the impact of climate change today."" Kenny says many priorstudieshave already shown that poor people tend to use no-strings cash aid effectively. ""And I think it makes particular sense when it comes to the climate crisis,"" he says. ""Giving people cash allows them to respond in the ways that they know best."" Early anecdotal evidence from the Mount Elgon study points at the ways people's individual priorities may vary. Mubarak, for instance, says he immediately used the money to buy land in a nearby district — ""out of the dangerous area,"" he says. He also bought metal sheets and poles and nails to build a house. He's still working on it, but he's already been able to move in. ""I'm finally going to save my family,"" he says. Jane Florence Kalenda, a mother of four, recently received $1,800 in no-strings cash from Give Directly. It's part of its study to see if the grants allow residents to find new, safer homes, off the risky slopes of Mount Elgon.Give Directlyhide caption Then there's Jane Florence Kalenda, a 56-year-old widowed mother of four. She says she, too, has used her grant to buy land off of the mountain and some construction materials. But she also decided to spend part of it on school fees for her children, even though that's left her short of the money needed to complete a new house. ""I estimate I still need about $530,"" she says. She's hoping to raise the money in a few more months by growing some onions from seeds that she also bought with the GiveDirectly grant. Laker-Oketta of GiveDirectly says while the nonprofit is obviously hoping this effort will get people off Mount Elgon right away, if people opt for paths like Kalenda's that slow the move, it's important to respect their choices. ""We need to know that people are going to make decisions based on what's important for them."" After all, she says, ""we're dealing with human beings. Not lab rats.""","['uganda', 'uganda', 'uganda', 'not found', 'rwanda', 'bangladesh', 'mozambique', 'nigeria']",us,False,False

<li>How much can trees fight climate change? Massively, but not alone, study finds</li></ul>
FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",Climate,"Restoring global forests where they occur naturally could potentially capture an additional 226 gigatons of planet-warming carbon, equivalent to about one-third of the amount that humans have released since the beginning of the Industrial Era, according to a new study published Monday in the journal Nature.The research, with input from more than 200 authors, leveraged vast troves of data collected by satellites and on the ground and was partly an effort to address the controversy surrounding an earlier paper.That study, in 2019, helped to spur the Trillion Trees movement but also caused a scientific uproar.The new conclusions were similar to those in a separate study published last year. Mainly, the extra storage capacity would come from allowing existing forests to recover to maturity.But major caveats remain: If we protect all current forests, where will people get timber, rubber and palm oil? Would forests be able to store carbon quickly enough? And how much forest carbon would be lost to fire, drought and pests as climate change intensifies?The 226 gigatons of storage cannot be achieved without cutting greenhouse gas emissions, said Thomas Crowther, the study’s senior author and a professor of ecology at ETH Zurich, a university in Switzerland. “If we continue emitting carbon, as we’ve done to date, then droughts and fires and other extreme events will continue to threaten the scale of the global forest system, further limiting its potential to contribute.”Forests are essential to tackling both the climate and biodiversity crises. They offer food, shelter and shade to humans and countless other species. They clean our air and water. And they pull climate-warming carbon out of the atmosphere. As the climate crisis intensifies, that ability has made them controversial: How much can we rely on trees to get us out of this mess?Crowther was the senior author of a polarizing study on forest carbon in 2019 that drew scientific backlash but also inspired an effort by the World Economic Forum to grow and conserve 1 trillion trees.In 2019, he acknowledged, careless language led to trees being wrongly painted as a silver bullet for climate change. Now, his biggest fear is that countries and companies will keep treating forests that way, using them for carbon offsets to enable the continued use of fossil fuels.“We are all terrified that this potential of nature gets misused,” Crowther said. “Nature has such spectacular potential to help us tackle global threats, but it will be devastating if major organizations use nature as an excuse to do more harm to our planet.”The World Economic Forum’s tree program, 1t.org, was started with funding from Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, and endorsed by figures from then-President Donald Trump to Jane Goodall. Crowther himself, a charismatic and media-savvy scientist, is an adviser to the group.His new study’s number of 226 gigatons of carbon approximates his previous one of 205, but it gets there very differently. Both papers exclude urban areas, croplands and pastures but include rangelands, where animals may graze at lower densities. In the new research, 61% of the additional carbon storage would come from protecting existing forests and the other 39% from growing trees in deforested areas with low human footprints.In the 2019 study, all the carbon came from growing trees where they could occur naturally outside of existing forests. More than 50 scientists published seven critiques in Science that year, disputing both the analysis and its implications. One accusation was that the study endorsed inappropriate tree planting on grasslands and other nonforested ecosystems, destroying native biodiversity. Another was that the estimates of carbon storage were far too high for the amount of land concerned.Simon Lewis, a professor of global change science at University College London, submitted one such critique in 2019. But the new study, he said, was “reasonable.”Still, he emphasized that carbon drawdown from forests should be kept in perspective. “There is still only a finite amount of land to dedicate to forests,” he said, “so only a small fraction of the potential carbon uptake has a chance of being realized.”Another critic from 2019, Joseph Veldman, a professor of ecology and conservation biology at Texas A&M University, praised the enormous amount of data the study brought to bear but said its findings still relied on inappropriate densities of trees in landscapes where they exist naturally but should remain sparse, such as savannas and deserts.Despite global pledges, leaders have struggled to rein in deforestation. Last year, the world lost 10% more primary tropical rainforest than in 2021, though Brazil’s current government has made recent progress.Restoration efforts have also proven problematic. In the name of fighting climate change, countries and companies have often invested in failed mass tree plantings or monocultures of commercial, nonnative species that hurt biodiversity. While the latter might grow quickly, they sequester only half as much carbon over time, Crowther said.He emphasized that restoration should be driven by local communities that choose to work in concert with nature to help themselves. A nonprofit he founded, Restor, connects community projects, such as an agroforestry farm in Ethiopia, with potential supporters.“Instead of removing the forests to grow coffee, they instead keep the forests standing,” Crowther said. “And because the forest captures water and nutrients, those trees grow really well without the need for fertilizers or irrigation, and as a result, nature makes their farm more productive.”(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)It’s unclear how much such efforts can scale up. Matthew Fagan, a professor of geography and environmental systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who works on global forest monitoring, said he believed the new estimate was too high because it did not account for people and fire.“The fact that it aligns with other rough estimates of global carbon owes more to the unfortunate reality that they share methods and data sources in common than to the truth,” he said.He and other scientists also raised concerns about the warming effects that trees can have in colder and drier climates as they absorb heat that would otherwise have been reflected by snow or grass.But there is one thing they all agree on: To tackle both climate change and biodiversity loss, the world must do far more to cut fossil fuels and end deforestation of old-growth forests.","['switzerland', 'russia', 'brazil', 'ethiopia', 'unitedstates']",in,False,False

But the effects of a warming climate are being felt throughout the year, and recent autumn months have been further off the charts than ever.In fact,climate changeand an El Niño have both contributed to the world in 2023 having itshottest autumnsince records began in 1850.Septemberwas 0.93°C above the 1991-2020 average, and a whole 1.75°C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial reference period. October was also the hottest on record, at0.85°Cabove the recent average.This hotautumnhas already meant stronger storms and more intense rainfall and droughts. And this in turn affects farming, energy, tourism and other sectors that depend on reliable seasons.A global system but local effectsWarmer oceans have been linked tointensification of stormsin the Atlantic. One of these, Storm Babet, recently broke UK rainfall recordsdating back to 1881. Babet was soon followed byStorm Ciarán, bringing more extreme winds and heavy rainfall to still-saturated lands.The UK is no stranger to Atlantic storm systems, but they primarily occur during the winter months. The fact that thesesevere stormsare occurring in autumn is unusual.Partly this is because anabnormally warm Atlantic Oceanis generating stronger storms (in174 years of data, August and September 2023 were the two months wheresea surface temperatureswere furthest above the long-term average). Warmer oceans release more moisture into the atmosphere and carry more energy which effectively acts as fuel for storms.When the tropical Atlantic is warm, storms generated there also change direction, tending totrack northward across the ocean before bending to the east. In future, warmer autumns are likely to mean more of these storms sustaining themselves across the Atlantic to hit Western Europe.Storms are getting stronger elsewhere too.Hurricane Otisrecently devastated the Mexican city of Acapulco, for instance. Otis developed from a regular storm into a huge hurricane in record time, and was the first time in history that a hurricane in the Eastern Pacific made landfall and sustained itself as a the strongest ""Category 5""storm.Tropical Cyclone Tejhit the Arabian Peninsula the week before with 480mm of rainfall in the Al–Ghaydah region in Yemen—eight times the annual average.Problems for farms and energy generationIn unusually warm autumns, extended periods ofheat and low rainfallcan impact late-season crops such as apples, pears, berries and brassicas. In November 2022, warm and dry weather resulted in theearly emergence of some winter cropsacross many European regions. In 2022, China experienced a shock to its autumn yields ofwheat and some vegetablesfollowing an extended period of drought and elevated temperatures into the Autumn harvesting season.Energy generation is also increasingly vulnerable to autumn heat. In 2022, a warm autumn meant Europeans used less natural gas for heating, and instead used electricityfor cooling. Drought adds acompoundingchallenge, as less power can be generated through hydroelectric dams, while less reliable reservoir levels make it harder to schedule generation in advance tocoincide with periods of peak demand. In late summer and autumn last year in France, rivers became so warm they were less able tocool down nuclear reactors.Autumn as the new summer?Tourism is just as vulnerable to unseasonal temperatures. While numbers are often dictated by external factors such as school holidays, extreme summer temperatures will increasingly see people going awayin spring and autumn instead.Yet even autumn destinations are finding things are changing. New England in the US is known for its spectacular colorful trees at this time of year, yet warming conditions are changing thetiming and vibrancyof its leaf fall. Autumn heatvariationcould impact the volume of visitors, threatening abillion dollartourism industry.Something similar is being observed inJapan, where leaves are staying on trees until later in the year. This can create further hazards, as when trees havemore leaf surface areathey're more exposed to destructive wind storms.These are just some of the effects of an unusually warm autumn, even by current standards. But with summers being extended and more storms and extreme weather in the autumn months seemingly the new norm, we need to start rethinking what weather we can expect at this time of year.","['uk', 'uk', 'turkey', 'mexico', 'yemen', 'china', 'france', 'us']",gb,False,False

The end of over two years of drought that pushed the country to the brink of famine has brought little relief for families. Floods - by some estimates the worst in decades - have driven close to half a million people from their homes and crippled families' attempts to rebuild their drought-ravaged livelihoods. ""The most vulnerable people in Somalia have been hit once again by climate change. With these floods following right after the drought, it feels like a relentless bombardment of climate shocks for struggling families,"" said Laura Turner, WFP Somalia Deputy Country Director. ""Humanitarian aid brought people back from the brink of starvation in 2022, but Somalia is still facing the highest levels of hunger it has suffered in over a decade. We need to provide communities with the tools and knowledge to weather these extremes to break the crisis-driven cycle of hunger that has afflicted Somalia for too long."" In October, as ominous weather forecasts predicted heavy rain and floods exacerbated by El Niño weather pattern, WFP activated a flood anticipatory action programme - its first in Africa - in coordination with the Government of Somalia. WFP delivered pre-emptive cash transfers and warning messages in districts projected to suffer heavy flooding, reaching over 200,000 people so far. The total disbursement under the programme will be US$4.1 million. WFP also pre-positioned boats in key locations to support food delivery when the floods hit. ""We heard the message that the floods were coming. We heard it several times while we stayed in the flood zones,"" Meymuna Ali, a resident of a flood zone in Beletweyne on the Shabelle River, told WFP last week. ""The message helped us [prepare to] evacuate. God willing, we will move."" The floods hit along the Juba river in early November, in areas such as Luuq and Baardheere,where a key bridge was swept away. Areas along the Shabelle River, including Beletweyne, were inundated over the weekend leaving communities battling to save their homes, livestock, and crops. The anticipatory action programmes in these areas meant that families had the information and means to protect their homes or move before the floods hit, leaving fewer people now in need of emergency assistance. But with a quarter of Somalia's population - 4.3 million people - forecast to face crisis-level hunger or worse (IPC3+) by the end of the year, the support of the humanitarian community remains a lifeline. The floods have exacerbated Somalia's hunger crisis, at a time when significant funding shortfalls mean that WFP is only able to provide food assistance to less than half of the people most in need. Without additional funding, WFP will struggle to scale anticipatory action programmes or make longer-term investments to build resilience, enable Somalia to adapt to these increasingly severe climate shocks and break the cycle of crisis-driven dependence on humanitarian aid. WFP's funding gap in Somalia is US$ 378 million from November 2023 to April 2024. # # # The United Nations World Food Programme is the world's largest humanitarian organization saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.","['somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'southsudan']",us,False,False

Nearly a third of that renewable energy should come from wind and solar power, said the report by researchers of Berlin-based Agora Energiewende. A fifth would be hydropower and other clean sources and the remainder, fossil fuels. The study analyzed energy plans of both developing nations like Indonesia andVietnam, where demand for energy is growing rapidly, and wealthier places likeJapanand South Korea, which have among the highest burdens of per capita greenhouse gas emissions. It did not include China, the world's biggest emitter of carbon, or India, another major contributor. A global temperature increase of 1.5C (2.7F) since pre-industrial times is considered a critical climate threshold beyond which risks of catastrophes rise. The world will likely lose most of its coral reefs, a key ice sheet could kick into irreversible melt, and water shortages, heat waves and death from extreme weather may surge, according to an earlier United Nations scientific report. Agora Energiewende researchers found that Asian nations are united in their heavy reliance on fossil fuels and national plans are not aligned with ambitious climate pledges announced by their governments. By using proven technologies like wind and solar power, countries can avoid exceeding limits they have set and also limit investment in fossil fuel infrastructure they won't need, said Mathis Rogner, the Southeast Asia project lead for Agora Energiewende and a co-author of the report. To conform with 1.5C (2.7F) limit, the nine countries included in the study need to add 45 to 55 gigawatts of solar energy and 20 gigawatts of wind energy every year. In 2021, they had installed a total of just 11.9 gigawatts of solar energy and 1.5 gigawatts of wind energy. The study reviewed energy plans of Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Taiwan. As of the end of 2022, the U.S. had installed capacity of more than 144 GW of wind power and 110 GW of solar photovoltaic power. The need for urgent action was echoed by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called for a “climate ambition supernova” after a U.N. analysis released Tuesday found that countries’ climate plans still lagged far behind what was needed. Much of the clean energy capacity the world has added since 2016 has been concentrated in the U.S., China and India. Even though wind and solar technologies have been getting cheaper every year, among other Asian nations, only Japan and Vietnam derive more than a tenth of their capacity from the wind and the sun. The vast increases in Chinese and Indian renewable energy capacity are an example for other Asian countries that lag behind. They also show how such transitions can create jobs and improve energy security, said Kanika Chawla, chief of staff at Sustainable Energy for All, the United Nations’ sustainable energy unit, who was not involved in the report. Many countries still rely heavily on large hydropower dams, which can involve hefty social and environmental costs and are vulnerable to drought. The report estimates that South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia each should add between 8 and 14 gigawatts of solar power annually. Indonesia now gets less than 1% of its power from wind and solar energy, according to a study by the U.K.-based thinktank Ember. South Korea and Thailand also still mostly depend on fossil fuel. Japan needs to add an average of 9 gigawatts of solar power a year and Vietnam, around 10 gigawatts, to meet end-of-the-decade targets. But the report says the goals are achievable since both countries have managed similar increases in the past. The report says Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines need to add between 1 and 3 gigawatts of energy from the sun each year to their grid. South Korea needs the biggest spurt in wind power — an average increase of 8 gigawatts each year — while Japan needs to add about 3 gigawatts. Vietnam should be deploying around 4 gigawatts in new wind power capacity, the report said. Lower potential for wind power in other countries means they should target between one and 2 gigawatts each year. The report calls for a “paradigm shift” to speed up the transition to wind and solar power. That would include removing subsidies for oil and gas that make renewables less competitive, simplifying bureaucratic hurdles such as permits and facilitating investments. At the same time, power grids need to be upgraded to allow for the variability and unpredictability of wind and solar power, it said. Despite a common misconception that wind and solar are more expensive and less stable than fossil fuel-powered generation, “Our analysis shows that often much higher shares of wind and solar can be reliably integrated into the power system than the operators expect,” Rogner of Agora said. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Despite growing calls for global action, energy-related carbon emissions hit new highs last year, the Lancet Countdown report said, singling out still-massive government subsidies and private bank investments into planet-heating fossil fuels. Last year people worldwide were exposed to an average of 86 days of life-threatening temperatures, according to the Lancet Countdown study. Around 60 percent of those days were made more than twice as likely due to climate change, it said. The number of people over 65 who died from heat rose by 85 percent from 1991-2000 to 2013-2022, it added. ""However these impacts that we are seeing today could be just an early symptom of a very dangerous future,"" Lancet Countdown's executive director Marina Romanello told journalists. Under a scenario in which the world warms by two degrees Celsius by the end of the century -- it is currently on track for 2.7C -- annual heat-related deaths were projected to increase 370 percent by 2050. That marks a 4.7-fold increase. Around 520 million more people will experience moderate or severe food insecurity by mid-century, according to the projections. And mosquito-borne infectious diseases will continue to spread into new areas. The transmission of dengue would increase by 36 percent under a 2C warming scenario, according to the study. Meanwhile, more than a quarter of cities surveyed by the researchers said they were worried that climate change would overwhelm their capacity to cope. ""We're facing a crisis on top of a crisis,"" said Lancet Countdown's Georgiana Gordon-Strachan, whose homeland Jamaica is currently in the middle of a dengue outbreak. ""People living in poorer countries, who are often least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, are bearing the brunt of the health impacts, but are least able to access funding and technical capacity to adapt to the deadly storms, rising seas and crop-withering droughts worsened by global heating,"" she said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres responded to the report by saying that ""humanity is staring down the barrel of an intolerable future"". ""We are already seeing a human catastrophe unfolding with the health and livelihoods of billions across the world endangered by record-breaking heat, crop-failing droughts, rising levels of hunger, growing infectious disease outbreaks, and deadly storms and floods,"" he said in a statement. Dann Mitchell, climate hazards chair at the UK's Bristol University, lamented that ""already catastrophic"" health warnings about climate change had ""not managed to convince the world's governments to cut carbon emissions enough to avoid the first Paris Agreement goal of 1.5C"". The UN warned on Tuesday that countries' current pledges will cut global carbon emissions by just two percent by 2030 from 2019 levels -- far short of the 43 percent drop needed to limit warming to 1.5C. Romanello warned that if more progress is not made on emissions, then ""the growing emphasis on health within climate change negotiations risks being just empty words"".","['unitedarabemirates', 'jamaica', 'uk']",us,False,False

The p… [+3656 chars]",Climate,"Annual heat-related deaths worldwide for people over 65 are projected to increase by 370% through the middle of the century if global temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius, a new report says. The projection comes as heat-related deaths of adults over 65 have increased by 85% since the 1990s, according to the annualLancet Countdown on Health and Climate Changereport. The hottest global temperatures in over 100,000 years were recorded in 2023 with the planet currently at 1.14°C of global heating, the report says. Increasing global temperatures are linked to environmental changes like melting Arctic ice caps, drought and heat waves, and more intense hurricanes and wildfires. These stark changes are more than just ecological concerns; they also significantly impact human health, the report stressed. This new Lancet report comes the same day asthe new White House climate report, which flagged that climate-related hazards such as extreme heat, drought, and wildfires will continue to grow and directly impact human health. There were on average 86 days of health-threatening high temperatures in 2018-2022, according to the Lancet report. Human-caused climate change made more than 60% of those days more likely to have happened, the analysis showed. ""We're already seeing climate change claiming lives or livelihoods in every part of the world. The impacts are happening here and now,"" said Marina Romanello, the executive director of the Lancet Countdown and a climate change and health researcher at University College London, during a press briefing. Droughts and heatwaves are increasing globally, leading to food insecurity and water scarcity, according to the researchers. There has been a 29% increase in areas of extreme drought since the 1950s. Around 127 million more people said that they experienced significant food insecurity in 2021 than annually between 1981 and 2010. The report also warned that warming ocean temperatures are enabling the spread of the Vibrio bacteria, which can cause serious illness and death if people swim in water with open wounds or eat raw or contaminated seafood. The coastline area suitable for Vibrio bacteria around the world has increased every year by 329 square kilometers since 1982, putting around 1.4 billion more people at risk of diarrheal disease, severe wound infections and sepsis by 2022. ""Climate breakdown has begun, and humanity is staring down the barrel of an intolerable future. We are already seeing a human catastrophe unfolding with the health and livelihoods of billions across the world endangered by record-breaking heat, crop-failing droughts, rising levels of hunger, growing infectious disease outbreaks, and deadly storms and floods,"" said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres in response to the Lancet report. The Paris Agreement, the international treaty on climate change, calls for the world to keep global warming to well below 2-degrees Celsius, with the aim of limiting the increase to 1.5-degrees Celsius. The new report found that under the 2-degree warming scenario, there would be 525 million additional people experiencing significant food insecurity by 2031-2060. There would be 23–39% more cases of infection with Vibrio bacteria under the 2-degree warming scenario. There would also be a 37% increase in the spread of dengue, a mosquito-borne illness that can be life threatening, the report says. ""Continued warming could lead to those patterns spiraling out of control,"" Romanello said to the projections outlined in the report. The researchers behind the report say that there needs to be urgent action on climate change to mitigate the health impacts.

At the same time, pastoralism is modernizing, with groups leveraging technology. The practice has survived for so long because it is designed to adapt to a changing environment — pastoralists move with animals to find fresh pasture and water, leaving behind fallow land to regrow. Experts say it's a lesson that could help those who raise livestock at larger scales adapt and reduce the impact on the environment. Pastoralists aren’t only trying to outrun climate change; they’re combatting it. Perhaps more than any other place, Mongolia is known for pastoralism. The practice is enshrined in the nation’s constitution, which calls its 80 million camels, yaks, cows, sheep, goats and horses “national wealth” protected by the state. For families like Agvaantogtokh’s, pastoralism is more than a profession. It’s a cultural identity that connects generations. At its heart is the human connection to animals. Agvaantogtokh and his family sell animals for meat. They also sell dairy products such as yogurt and hard cheeses. While they consider animals their property, they also see them as living beings working alongside them. Researchers say herders believe in “animal agency.” Agvaantogtokh lets his livestock pick grass, flowers or herbs to eat, and find their own water. To him, fencing an animal and asking it to eat the same thing daily is like putting a person in prison. In Mongolia, weather extremes are a part of life. When Agvaantogtokh thinks about climate change, he worries about humans and livestock. Chronic drought and warming plague Mongolia. Since 1940, the government says, average temperatures have risen 2.2 degrees Celsius (nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit). Dzuds — natural disasters unique to Mongolia caused by droughts and severe, snowy winters — have grown harsher and more frequent. A dzud pushed Agvaantogtokh and his family to move out after a disastrous winter killed 400 of their animals. The family lives simply. They have a sink with a rubber pump to limit water use. They live in a tent called a ger, with wooden circular frames insulated with sheepskin and felt, and doors facing east to let in the morning sun. Nurmaa, who married into this way of life, uses a boiler fired with horse dung to cook and stay warm. “Year by year,” she said, “I have learned a lot of things.” Herding and birthing animals. Setting up camp. Cooking meals of breads, stews, milk tea and homemade wine. In Senegal, caravans carry the comforts of a furnished home, such as a metal bed frame and mattress, and water for people and animals. With the rainy season approaching earlier this year, Ndiaye, his son-in-law Moussa Ifra Ba and the rest of the family prepared for a 170-kilometer (106-mile), 16-day trek. “The livestock are hungry, and you sometimes have trouble selling one because it is so thin,” Ndiaye said. Water and plentiful grass have become harder to come by. Ba said: “Many varieties of tree have disappeared, and even our children are unaware of certain species. The best varieties of grass no longer grow in certain areas, and the most widespread grass is more like rubber: It fills the belly but doesn’t nourish the animals.” Meals for Ndiaye’s family rarely include meat. Only when they pass through certain villages can they stock up onfood— vegetables, rice. Per-person meat consumption in Senegal is among the lowest in the world; rates are more than six times higher in Mongolia. Ndiaye’s family doesn’t sell animals regularly. Meat is mostly for special occasions: weddings, holidays. When they do, a few head of cattle can provide enough money to get married, buy rice or even emigrate. To keep their practice alive, pastoralists seek ways to modernize. In Mongolia, Lkhaebum recently began using a motorbike to more easily search for horses. The family has a solar-powered battery that runs a television and washing machine, a karaoke machine, and a cellphone to keep track of weather and access Facebook groups where herders exchange information. Though modern tools promise to make things easier, many pastoralists run into obstacles. Those in Senegal, for example, often struggle to find cellphone signals. They rely mostly on older technology and methods. An important advancement in infrastructure has helped: water towers known as forages that have sprung up with government assistance. Perhaps the biggest threat to pastoralism comes from within, as the next generation chooses other paths. Nurmaa and Agvaantogtokh's 18-year-old daughter studies medicine. Their son spoke about becoming a herder in his early teens. But not anymore. “I won’t regret anything if my child won’t be a herder,” Nurmaa said. “I would like them to do what they aspire to do.” Four of Ndiaye’s seven living children don’t travel with their parents. Ba, 28, and his wife Houraye, 20, have a 2-year-old daughter and want to expand their family. They mused about a future in which at least one child stays in pastoralism while at least one goes to school. “I’d like my children to keep up with the changing world,” Ba said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

At the same time, pastoralism is modernizing, with groups leveraging new technology to better care for their animals. But the practice has survived for so long because it is designed to adapt to a changing environment — pastoralists move with their animals to find fresh pasture and water, leaving behind fallow land to heal and regrow. “The broad view is that having mobile animals enables you to leave places that are overused or that have scarce water orfoodresources and move to places where there are more resources,” said Forrest Fleischman, who researches natural resource policy at the University of Minnesota. “And that means you’re not going to hammer the one place you’re stuck in.” Experts say it is a lesson that could help those who raise livestock at much larger scales adapt and reduce the impact of animal agriculture on the environment. Pastoralists aren’t only trying to outrun climate change; they’re combatting it. “They have the Indigenous knowledge,” said Edna Wangui, a geography professor who studies the practice at Ohio University. “There is a lot we can learn.” Perhaps more than any other place, Mongolia is known for pastoralism. The practice is enshrined in the nation’s constitution, which calls its 80 million camels, yaks, cows, sheep, goats and horses “national wealth” protected by the state. For families like Agvaantogtokh’s, pastoralism is more than a profession. It’s a cultural identity that connects generations across time. And at its heart is the human connection to animals. Agvaantogtokh and his family sell animals for meat. They also sell dairy products such as yogurt and hard cheeses. While they consider the animals their property, they also see them as living beings working alongside them for a common purpose. Researchers say herders believe in “animal agency.” Agvaantogtokh lets his livestock pick what grass, flowers or herbs they eat, and find their own water. To him, fencing an animal and asking it to eat the same thing every day is like putting a person in prison. Weather extremes are a part of life in Mongolia, and managing them is increasingly difficult as the environment changes. When Agvaantogtokh thinks about climate change, he worries about what it means for humans and livestock. One spring day, he felt the wind whip up and watched blue skies turn menacingly dark. In the distance, he spotted a wall of dirt rushing toward him. “Dust storm,” he muttered. His father, Lkhaebum, left a bowl of soup half-eaten on the table. Both set off on motorbikes to make sure their animals were safe. “We need more rain,” said Lkhaebum, who like other Mongolians uses only his given name. “If the grass isn’t growing, it is very challenging for us.” Chronic drought plagues Mongolia. So does warming. Since 1940, the country’s government says, average temperatures have risen 2.2 degrees Celsius (nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit) — a measure that may seem small, but for global averages, scientists say every tenth of a degree matters, and a warming world brings more weather extremes. And dzuds — natural disasters unique to Mongolia caused by droughts and severe, snowy winters — have grown harsher and more frequent and can keep livestock from accessing water or food. A dzud pushed Agvaantogtokh and his family to move out of a southwestern province after a disastrous winter killed 400 of their animals. They’ve been in the eastern province of Sukhbaatar since 2020. The family lives simply. They have a sink with a rubber pump to limit water use. They live in a tent called a ger, which has wooden circular frames insulated with sheepskin and felt, and doors facing east to let in the morning sun. Nurmaa, who married into this way of life, uses a boiler fired with horse dung to cook and stay warm. “Year by year,” she said, “I have learned a lot of things.” Herding and birthing animals. Helping set up camp. Cooking big meals of breads, stews, milk tea and homemade wine. But every place the family moves its ger, she has a sense of a settled life. Each belonging is systematically placed in the same spot — something stable and predictable in a world of constant change. In Senegal, caravans carry the comforts of a furnished home, such as a metal bed frame and mattress, and water for people and animals. With the rainy season approaching earlier this year, Ndiaye, his son-in-law Moussa Ifra Ba and the rest of the family prepared for a 170-kilometer (106-mile), 16-day trek. Water and plentiful grass have become harder to come by. “One of the main difficulties related to pastoralism is the lack of grazing,” Ndiaye said. “The livestock are hungry, and you sometimes have trouble selling one because it is so thin.” “Many varieties of tree have disappeared, and even our children are unaware of certain species,” Ba said. “The best varieties of grass no longer grow in certain areas, and the most widespread grass is more like rubber: It fills the belly but doesn’t nourish the animals.” Meals for Ndiaye’s family rarely include meat and are carefully planned. Only when they pass through certain villages can they stock up on food — vegetables, rice and other essentials. Overall, per-person meat consumption in Senegal is among the lowest in the world; rates are more than six times higher in Mongolia. Ndiaye’s family doesn’t sell their animals regularly because meat is mostly for special occasions: weddings, or holidays such as Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr. When they do, a few head of cattle can provide enough money to get married, buy rice or even emigrate. The family has the same deep respect for their animals that Mongolian pastoralists do. Ba is especially drawn to the sheep. He’s noticed that the rams cry when they move away from him, remember the names he gives them and come when they’re called. “It’s a real friendship,” Ba said. In their four-cart caravan, young people and young animals both get special care. Ndiaye’s 5-year-old daughter, Aminata, and 2-year-old granddaughter, Aissata, ride atop one cart with the women. In another, baby sheep too young to walk for long in the heat are bound together with netting. Ba said he can’t imagine any other life: “A village without cows has no soul.” To keep their practice alive, pastoralists around the world are looking for ways to modernize. In Mongolia, Lkhaebum recently began using a motorbike to more easily search for horses, which are never kept fenced. One nippy morning, his calf-length tunic billowed around him as he began a search, stopping occasionally to peer through binoculars toward a herd grazing on a faraway hill. The family also has a solar-powered battery that runs a television and washing machine, a karaoke machine, and a cellphone to keep track of weather and access Facebook groups where herders exchange information. “We now have 4G cellular data, and it helps us a lot in communicating and getting forecasts,” Nurmaa said. “It really helps us a lot with communicating with our children because they’re far away.” Their 18-year-old daughter studies medicine in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar. Their two younger children, a 13-year-old son and a 9-year-old daughter, are in school. The son spoke about becoming a herder when he was in his early teens. But not anymore. “I won’t regret anything if my child won’t be a herder,” Nurmaa said. “I would like them to do what they aspire to do.” Her view is not unusual. “If you asked parents, very few of them want their children to grow up to be pastoralists,” professor Wangui said. “They want their children to be something else because they’re seeing the life of pastoralists is a tough life.” Though modern tools promise to make things easier, many pastoralists run into obstacles. Those in Senegal, for example, often struggle to find signals for their cell phones. They rely mostly on older technology and methods. One evening, Ndiaye’s grown daughter, Houraye, peeled onions for the family’s meal, stirring a pot of rice illuminated by the glowing embers of her fire. When it was ready, her seven relatives gathered under the stars with small flashlights and turned on the handheld radio they charge off their solar panel. The bleating of sheep nearly drowned out the traditional melodies. An important advancement in infrastructure has helped the family: water towers known as forages that have sprung up with government assistance. Previously, finding water could require a 35-kilometer (22-mile) trek. Now, the family plots trips along the path of these towers, where they can refill their jugs and replenish their animals in long troughs. Still, some leaders don’t offer help to pastoralists. Conflicts between herders and settled farmers also can erupt surrounding land use and access to water. A few advocacy groups advise pastoralists to choose settled lives for their own good. In Senegal’s Sahel region — where the United Nations estimates 65% of meat and 70% of milk sold at local markets come from pastoralists — the head of the Association for Promoting Livestock Farming in the Sahel and Savannah suggests people put their children in school and diversify incomes. “Climate change has caused enormous damage, and people are not aware of the dangers that lie ahead,” said Moussa Demba Assette Ba. “If you invest all your income in livestock and disaster strikes, you lose everything, and that’s what climate change can do.” The former pastoralist built a home in 2006 that has since turned into a sprawling compound that provides solar power to neighbors. He encourages others to settle down as he has and seek ways to increase the quality, not quantity, of their animals. But perhaps the biggest threat to pastoralism comes from within, as the next generation chooses other paths. Four of Ndiaye’s seven living children don’t travel with their parents. He relies on help from Ba and a paid family friend to direct the animals to their destination. Ba, 28, and his wife Houraye, 20, have a 2-year-old daughter and want to expand their family. They mused about a future in which at least one child stays in pastoralism while at least one goes to school. “I’d like my children to keep up with the changing world,” Ba said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

As nomadic pastoralists, they keep domestic animals and move with them to seek fresh pastures—often selling some of their livestock for meat.Although nomadic pastoralism has sustained these populations for millennia, it faces mounting pressures from deteriorating environments, shrinking rangelands, and new generations who seek a less grueling and tenuous life. At the same time, pastoralism is modernizing, with groups leveraging new technology to better care for their animals.But the practice has survived for so long because it is designed to adapt to a changing environment—pastoralists move with their animals to find fresh pasture and water, leaving behind fallow land to heal and regrow. ""The broad view is that having mobile animals enables you to leave places that are overused or that have scarce water orfood resourcesand move to places where there are more resources,"" said Forrest Fleischman, who researches natural resource policy at the University of Minnesota. ""And that means you're not going to hammer the one place you're stuck in.""Experts say it is a lesson that could help those who raise livestock at much larger scales adapt and reduce the impact of animal agriculture on the environment. Pastoralists aren't only trying to outrunclimate change; they're combatting it.""They have the Indigenous knowledge,"" said Edna Wangui, a geography professor who studies the practice at Ohio University.

The practice is enshrined in the nation's constitution, which calls its 80 million camels, yaks, cows, sheep, goats and horses ""national wealth"" protected by the state.For families like Agvaantogtokh's, pastoralism is more than a profession. It's a cultural identity that connects generations across time. And at its heart is the human connection to animals.Agvaantogtokh and his family sell animals for meat. They also sell dairy products such as yogurt and hard cheeses. While they consider the animals their property, they also see them as living beings working alongside them for a common purpose.Researchers say herders believe in ""animal agency."" Agvaantogtokh lets his livestock pick what grass, flowers or herbs they eat, and find their own water. To him, fencing an animal and asking it to eat the same thing every day is like putting a person in prison.The sister of herder Lkhaebum feeds a young foal while driving to a new pasture in the Munkh-Khaan region of the Sukhbaatar district in southeast Mongolia, Sunday, May 15, 2023.

When Agvaantogtokh thinks about climate change, he worries about what it means for humans and livestock.One spring day, he felt the wind whip up and watched blue skies turn menacingly dark. In the distance, he spotted a wall of dirt rushing toward him.""Dust storm,"" he muttered. His father, Lkhaebum, left a bowl of soup half-eaten on the table. Both set off on motorbikes to make sure their animals were safe.""We need more rain,"" said Lkhaebum, who like other Mongolians uses only his given name. ""If the grass isn't growing, it is very challenging for us.""Chronic drought plagues Mongolia. So does warming. Since 1940, the country's government says,average temperatureshave risen 2.2 degrees Celsius (nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit)—a measure that may seem small, but for global averages, scientists say every tenth of a degree matters, and a warming world brings more weather extremes.A sandstorm covers a railway track in Sainshand, east of Gobi desert, in Mongolia, May 19, 2023.

""One of the main difficulties related to pastoralism is the lack of grazing,"" Ndiaye said. ""The livestock are hungry, and you sometimes have trouble selling one because it is so thin.""""Many varieties of tree have disappeared, and even our children are unaware of certain species,"" Ba said. ""The best varieties of grass no longer grow in certain areas, and the most widespread grass is more like rubber: It fills the belly but doesn't nourish the animals.""Lkhaebum holds his cap as a sudden dust storm swirls outside his ger in the Munkh-Khaan region of the Sukhbaatar district, in southeast Mongolia, Saturday, May 13, 2023.

Only when they pass through certain villages can they stock up on food—vegetables, rice and other essentials.Overall, per-person meat consumption in Senegal is among the lowest in the world; rates are more than six times higher in Mongolia.Ndiaye's family doesn't sell their animals regularly because meat is mostly for special occasions: weddings, or holidays such as Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr. When they do, a few head of cattle can provide enough money to get married, buy rice or even emigrate.The family has the same deep respect for their animals that Mongolian pastoralists do. Ba is especially drawn to the sheep. He's noticed that the rams cry when they move away from him, remember the names he gives them and come when they're called.""It's a real friendship,"" Ba said.Herder Agvaantogtokh saddles a horse for his wife, Nurmaa, in preparation for a 24-kilometer (15-mile) journey with their livestock to a new location in the Munkh-Khaan region of the Sukhbaatar district, in southeast Mongolia, Sunday, May 14, 2023.

One nippy morning, his calf-length tunic billowed around him as he began a search, stopping occasionally to peer through binoculars toward a herd grazing on a faraway hill.The family also has a solar-powered battery that runs a television and washing machine, a karaoke machine, and a cellphone to keep track of weather and access Facebook groups where herders exchange information.Goats and sheep run towards a water point before undertaking a 24-kilometer (15-mile) journey to a new location in the Munkh-Khaan region of the Sukhbaatar district, in southeast Mongolia, Sunday, May 14, 2023.

Those in Senegal, for example, often struggle to find signals for their cell phones. They rely mostly on older technology and methods.One evening, Ndiaye's grown daughter, Houraye, peeled onions for the family's meal, stirring a pot of rice illuminated by the glowing embers of her fire. When it was ready, her seven relatives gathered under the stars with small flashlights and turned on the handheld radio they charge off their solar panel. The bleating of sheep nearly drowned out the traditional melodies.An important advancement in infrastructure has helped the family: water towers known as forages that have sprung up with government assistance. Previously, finding water could require a 35-kilometer (22-mile) trek. Now, the family plots trips along the path of these towers, where they can refill their jugs and replenish their animals in long troughs.Still, some leaders don't offer help to pastoralists. Conflicts between herders and settled farmers also can erupt surrounding land use and access to water.A family photograph of herder Agvaantogtokh, his wife, Nurmaa, and their children hangs in their ger along with a teddy bear and some books in the Munkh-Khaan region of the Sukhbaatar district, in southeast Mongolia, Saturday, May 13, 2023. “I won’t regret anything if my child won’t be a herder,” Nurmaa says. “I would like them to do what they aspire to do.” Credit: AP Photo/Manish SwarupA few advocacy groups advise pastoralists to choose settled lives for their own good. In Senegal's Sahel region—where the United Nations estimates 65% of meat and 70% of milk sold at local markets come from pastoralists—the head of the Association for Promoting Livestock Farming in the Sahel and Savannah suggests people put their children in school and diversify incomes.""Climate change has caused enormous damage, and people are not aware of the dangers that lie ahead,"" said Moussa Demba Assette Ba. ""If you invest all your income in livestock and disaster strikes, you lose everything, and that's what climate change can do.""The former pastoralist built a home in 2006 that has since turned into a sprawling compound that provides solar power to neighbors. He encourages others to settle down as he has and seek ways to increase the quality, not quantity, of their animals.But perhaps the biggest threat to pastoralism comes from within, as the next generation chooses other paths.Four of Ndiaye's seven living children don't travel with their parents. He relies on help from Ba and a paid family friend to direct the animals to their destination.Lkhaebum, left, with his daughter-in-law, Nurmaa, right, and others shelter inside their ger during a sudden dust storm in the Munkh-Khaan region of the Sukhbaatar district, in southeast Mongolia, Saturday, May 13, 2023.

The gruesome sight has haunted residents like Ayaan Mohamed, who lives near the graveyard. ""Seven families including mine have fled the neighbourhood,"" she told the BBC. With houses partially submerged and human remains floating nearby, they fear an outbreak of disease, she says. Some of the bodies were recognisable, further traumatising people - and as the water has subsided unearthed bones have also been found. ""The floods revealed the remains of a highly esteemed Muslim cleric. He was laid to rest 18 years ago,"" Ms Mohamed said. ""His students and other clerics attempted to gather the remains,"" she said, but they were unable to do so. These are scenes the city has never witnessed before. At least 32 people have been killed across the country and the UN warns that more than 1.6 million people could be affected in the devastating floods which follow years of drought. The situation in Galkayo is not as a severe as in the Gedo region of southern Somalia, where the River Juba has burst its banks and swept away a key bridge in the city of Bardere. It was overwhelmed by floodwaters and collapsed on Saturday. Mohamed Abdirahin says almost all the city's residents have been forced to move to the outskirts. The 70-year-old was a prosperous merchant and farmer until last week. ""I left everything behind,"" he told the BBC. ""I salvaged what I could with my bare hands from my shop - the rest was swept away by the water. It's like my life ended like that,"" Mr Abdirahin says. He is finding it hard to come to terms with how swiftly his life was transformed as floodwaters first inundated his shop, then brought down his home. Mr Abdirahin also had a farm just outside the city, where he went to check on his mature fruit trees after his family were forced to leave their compound in the city. He had been hoping for a bountiful harvest at the end of January, but that dream has been swept away along with the fruit. ""The 10m- (32ft-) high mango trees had almost sunk when we were leaving, I couldn't see anything standing on my land,"" Mr Abdirahin said. One part of the city, which is on higher ground, has been spared, but it has become inaccessible by road without the bridge. It is a vital lifeline for all those that have lost their homes as the district has food stores and a health care centre. People have to use small boats to reach there. ""We wait more than four hours for those boats to go and get for us something to eat,"" Mr Abdirahin said. Somalia's fragile, UN-backed government has been trying to provide emergency relief, but it says it cannot cover all the affected areas. ""For the last five days, we have supplied many materials for those in need - the current situation has overwhelmed the government capabilities,"" Somalia's Deputy Prime Minister Salah Jama told the BBC. Another problem is that some areas are not in the hands of the government and are controlled by the al-Qaeda-linked group al-Shabab. The Somali Disaster Management Agency (Sodma) says it has been receiving regular calls from people living in al-Shabab territory, but it is not able to help as it would be too dangerous for officials to venture there. In some cities people whose houses are still standing have been told to take in those who have been made homeless - and some communities have been clubbing together to cook meals for one another. When the long-awaited rainy season arrives in Somalia - it is usually a time for celebration, symbolising prosperity to come, especially when the country has been increasingly experiencing droughts. People often venture outdoors to explore the ponds and watering holes that fill up and sometimes even go swimming. The niece and daughter of Anab Deerow, who lives in El-Wak west of Bardere on the border with Kenya, went out to have fun after a heavy downpour. Ms Deerow said the two girls had been so excited as they had just finished their exams and it was the first day of their holidays before starting senior school next year. The cousins had been playing outside for a few hours, taking selfies and had just clambered down to see a pool in a small valley outside the town when a torrent of water swept them away. Ms Deerow's eight-year-old daughter witnessed it and came screaming home to tell her. The girls' lifeless bodies were found later following a long search after the water had subsided. ""They had returned from school a day before they died. I'm at a loss for words. It seems the angel of death called them out,"" Ms Deerow told the BBC. The heavy rainfall and floods are expected to continue until the end of November, according to Sodma. As well as those who have had to leave their homes, 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million acres) of farmland could potentially be destroyed, the UN warns. The thought of more rain falling is terrifying for many people already struggling to find food and clean water. Mr Abdirahin and his family of 12 now find themselves sleeping in the dense bush land outside Bardere, where they have been for more than a week. ""We are totally lost in the bushes,"" he said, becoming overwhelmed with emotion. ""We are just alive for no reason. We are terrified. Just waiting for help from God.""

And at first glance, everything appears the way it may have looked all those years back. A herder watches attentively as a horse gave birth on a cold spring morning. Families look for pastures for their animals to graze. Gers — traditional insulated tents made with wooden frames — still face east and the rising sun, as they have for nomads since the days of Genghis Khan. But climate change is altering everything: Since 1940, the country’s government says, average temperatures have risen 2.2 degrees Celsius (nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit). With the increase comes the threat of pastures being eaten away by an encroaching desert and water sources drying out. And dzuds — natural disasters unique to Mongolia caused by droughts and severe, snowy winters — have grown harsher and more frequent. “We need more rain,” said Lkhaebum, who like other Mongolians uses only his given name and has been herding for decades. Lkhaebum and other nomads of Mongolia have adapted, once again, adding new technologies to their arsenal of traditional knowledge to negotiate an increasingly unreliable climate. Motorbikes mean they can zip through dust storms to look for lost sheep. Solar energy means they can keep their phones charged and access the internet to exchange information with neighbors about newer pastures, and keep their freezers going to preserve meat for lean days. The ability to deal with climate change will also impact those who live in cities, including the capital, Ulaanbaatar. The 1.6 million people of the city constitute nearly half of the country's population, and more people are moving in every day. Construction is booming to provide housing, skyscrapers dot the skyline, and roads are snarled with large cars. And every day, trucks arrive in urban markets with animals raised in the countryside to feed city inhabitants. Sukhbaatar Square, where protesters had rallied in 1990 to demand freedom from a weakening Soviet Union, now has young boys playingbasketballin the evening. Many don't see a future in herding, but they admit the importance that nomads and their animals have in their culture. ___ EDITORS’ NOTE — This story is part of The Protein Problem, an AP series that examines the question: Can we feed this growing world without starving the planet?

Nonetheless, the tree’s reddish bark, swooping branches and thick, conical base identify it as the Pacific Northwest’s iconic western red cedar. Christine Buhl, a forest health specialist for the Oregon Department of Forestry, plunges a tool called an increment borer into the dead tree’s trunk. Twisting the handle of the corkscrew-like borer, Buhl extracts a long, thin sample of the tree’s inner growth rings. The rings become thinner over time, indicating the tree’s growth slowed before the tree finally died, a sign that this red cedar, like thousands of others in Oregon and Washington, died from drought. “That’s why it’s the canary,” says Buhl. “Any tree that’s less drought tolerant is going to be the canary in the coal mine. They’re going to start bailing (out).” For thousands of years, people have used red cedar to make everything from canoes to clothing. Red cedar’s many uses have earned the species endearing names, including the “Tree of Life.” More recently, scientists have started calling this water-loving relative of redwoods by a less flattering name: “the climate canary.” Last year, Buhl and colleagues reported that red cedars were dying throughout the tree’s growing range not because of a fungus or insect attack, but due to the region’s “climate change-induced drought.” Red cedars aren’t alone. In recent years, at least 15 native Pacific Northwest tree species have experienced growth declines and die-offs, 10 of which have been linked to drought and warming temperatures, according to recent studies and reports. Many researchers, Buhl included, are now arguing that these drought-driven die-offs are the beginning of a much larger and long-predicted shift in tree growing ranges due to climate change. ___ EDITOR’S NOTE: This story is part of a collaboration between The Associated Press and Columbia Insight, exploring the impact of climate on trees in the Pacific Northwest. ___ Trees, and plants generally, have growing ranges that are largely determined by climate factors, namely moisture and temperature. For decades, scientists have argued that as atmospheric warming continues, growing ranges in the Northern Hemisphere will shift upslope in elevation and farther north, leaving many trees stranded in a warmer, drier world. As climate mismatch sets in, trees are expected to die-off and not grow back, according to predictions. Daniel DePinte, Forest Service aerial survey program manager, suspects range changes are driving “Firmageddon.” A term coined by researchers, including DePinte, “Firmageddon” refers to the more than 1,875 square-mile (4,856-square-kilometer) die-off of five fir species in Oregon, Washington and northern California. “The forests are moving uphill,” said DePinte. DePinte and colleagues first identified and named the massive, drought-driven fir “mortality event” last year while surveying area forests via airplane. According to tree-range predictions, climate-induced die-offs are expected to start at the edges of growing ranges, including at lower-elevation locations that are predicted to become too warm and dry for many species. DePinte’s survey revealed that the largest die-offs associated with Firmageddon are occurring at lower-elevation sites. Buhl and colleagues found a similar pattern with western red cedar. Mortality was greatest at sites less than about 650 feet (200 meters) in elevation west of the Cascade Range, according to their analysis. Scientists have also observed a similar pattern for Douglas fir, the region’s leading commercial timber species. Douglas fir is currently experiencing a 720-square-mile (1,865-square-kilometer) die-off, the majority in the Klamath Mountains near the southern Oregon cities of Ashland and Medford. The die-off is limited to the lower elevations but is likely to move uphill as temperatures warm in the coming decades, according to a study in the Journal of Forestry. “Our analysis concluded that if climate change continues as predicted, we could see increased Douglas fir mortality at higher elevations,” said study coauthor, David Shaw, a professor and forest health specialist at Oregon State University. Shaw called the die-off “consistent with predictions for climate change.” But whereas red cedar is believed to be dying from drought alone, the Firmageddon and Douglas fir die-offs have been linked to a combination of drought weakening trees and insect pests moving in for the kill. “These insects are not normally tree killers,” said DePinte. “This is evidence that the forests are reacting to climate change and droughts.” Douglas fir is not considered a true fir and is not officially part of Firmageddon, according to DePinte. The combination of drought-induced stress and pests, said Patrick Tobin, associate professor of disturbance ecology at the University of Washington, is analogous to a person with a weakened immune system dying from the flu. “Drought-stress opens a window for biotic agents that might otherwise not be able to overcome a healthy, well-defended tree,” said Tobin. Tobin is a coauthor of a 2021 study in the journal Forest Ecology and Management on the widespread decline of big leaf maples in western Washington. Tobin’s study was unable to determine whether drought alone or drought in combination with disease-causing fungi was killing the native maples. As for the climate canary, Buhl believes red cedar is unlikely to disappear from the landscape entirely but probably won’t grow back in areas where it’s dying off. “Unless we turn back climate change, there is no reason to hope western red cedar is going to make a comeback,” said Buhl. ___ Nathan Gilles is a science writer and journalist based in Vancouver, Washington. ___ Columbia Insight is an Oregon-based nonprofit news website covering environmental issues affecting the Pacific Northwest. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Nonetheless, the tree's reddish bark, swooping branches and thick, conical base identify it as the Pacific Northwest's iconic western red cedar.Christine Buhl, a forest health specialist for the Oregon Department of Forestry, plunges a tool called an increment borer into the dead tree's trunk. Twisting the handle of the corkscrew-like borer, Buhl extracts a long, thin sample of the tree's inner growth rings.The rings become thinner over time, indicating the tree's growth slowed before the tree finally died, a sign that this red cedar, like thousands of others in Oregon and Washington, died from drought.""That's why it's the canary,"" says Buhl. ""Any tree that's less drought tolerant is going to be the canary in the coal mine. They're going to start bailing (out).""For thousands of years, people have used red cedar to make everything from canoes to clothing.Red cedar's many uses have earned the species endearing names, including the ""Tree of Life."" More recently, scientists have started calling this water-loving relative of redwoods by a less flattering name: ""the climate canary.""Last year, Buhl and colleaguesreported that red cedars were dyingthroughout the tree's growing range not because of a fungus or insect attack, but due to the region's ""climate change-induced drought.""Red cedars aren't alone.In recent years, at least15 native Pacific Northwest tree specieshave experienced growth declines and die-offs, 10 of which have been linked to drought and warming temperatures, according torecent studies and reports.Many researchers, Buhl included, are now arguing that these drought-driven die-offs are the beginning of a much larger and long-predicted shift in tree growing ranges due to climate change.Trees, and plants generally, have growing ranges that are largely determined by climate factors, namely moisture and temperature.For decades, scientists have argued that as atmospheric warming continues, growing ranges in the Northern Hemisphere will shift upslope in elevation and farther north, leaving many trees stranded in a warmer, drier world.As climate mismatch sets in, trees are expected to die-off and not grow back, according to predictions.Daniel DePinte, Forest Service aerial survey program manager, suspects range changes are driving ""Firmageddon."" A term coined by researchers, including DePinte, ""Firmageddon"" refers to the more than 1,875 square-mile (4,856-square-kilometer) die-off of five fir species in Oregon, Washington and northern California.""The forests are moving uphill,"" said DePinte.DePinte and colleagues first identified and named the massive, drought-driven fir ""mortality event"" last year while surveying area forests via airplane.According to tree-range predictions, climate-induced die-offs are expected to start at the edges of growing ranges, including at lower-elevation locations that are predicted to become too warm and dry for many species.DePinte's survey revealed that the largest die-offs associated with Firmageddon are occurring at lower-elevation sites.Buhl and colleagues found a similar pattern with western red cedar. Mortality was greatest at sites less than about 650 feet (200 meters) in elevation west of the Cascade Range, according to their analysis.Scientists have also observed a similar pattern for Douglas fir, the region's leading commercial timber species. Douglas fir is currently experiencing a 720-square-mile (1,865-square-kilometer) die-off, the majority in the Klamath Mountains near the southern Oregon cities of Ashland and Medford.The die-off is limited to the lower elevations but is likely to move uphill as temperatures warm in the coming decades, according to a study in theJournal of Forestry.""Our analysis concluded that if climate change continues as predicted, we could see increased Douglas fir mortality at higher elevations,"" said study co-author, David Shaw, a professor and forest health specialist at Oregon State University.Shaw called the die-off ""consistent with predictions for climate change.""But whereas red cedar is believed to be dying from drought alone, the Firmageddon and Douglas fir die-offs have been linked to a combination of drought weakening trees and insect pests moving in for the kill.""These insects are not normally tree killers,"" said DePinte. ""This is evidence that the forests are reacting to climate change and droughts.""Douglas fir is not considered a true fir and is not officially part of Firmageddon, according to DePinte.The combination of drought-induced stress and pests, said Patrick Tobin, associate professor of disturbance ecology at the University of Washington, is analogous to a person with a weakened immune system dying from the flu.""Drought-stress opens a window for biotic agents that might otherwise not be able to overcome a healthy, well-defended tree,"" said Tobin.Tobin is a co-author of a 2021 study in the journal Forest Ecology and Management on the widespread decline of big leaf maples in western Washington. Tobin's study was unable to determine whether drought alone or drought in combination with disease-causing fungi was killing the native maples.As for the climate canary, Buhl believes red cedar is unlikely to disappear from the landscape entirely but probably won't grow back in areas where it's dying off.""Unless we turn back climate change, there is no reason to hope western red cedar is going to make a comeback,"" said Buhl.Journal information:Forest Ecology and Management© 2023 The Associated Press.

These impacts are unequal, disproportionately affecting the most frontline populations in the United States.""Climate change will manifest through profound changes to the movement, amounts, and timing of water,"" said CU Boulder's Liz Payton, a water resources specialist in the CIRES-based Western Water Assessment, and lead author of the water chapter. ""The water chapter offers a big-picture understanding of the magnitude of these changes and the challenges ahead.""Payton worked closely with a team of 11 authors from around the country who brought expertise inclimate science, hydrology, groundwater,water management, water quality, and Tribal water issues.The NCA is a Congressionally mandated report released every four years by the U.S. Global Change Research Program. It synthesizes scientific knowledge about current and projected trends inglobal change, both human-induced and natural, for the recent past and the next 25 to 100 years.The water chapter, one of 32 chapters in the NCA5, explores the nexus of climate change and water, such as how increasingly heavy rainfall events threaten people and infrastructure in U.S. cities andrural communities.Overall,climate change impactson water are dire; but the authors explained that science advances are increasingly helping to shape decisions. For example, the report cites international collaboration among two Canadian provinces, eight U.S. states, and several sovereign Tribes and First Nations to manage the water in the Great Lakes collaboratively and equitably, addressing both flooding and coastal wetland health.By contrast, there has been little to no progress in many areas, the chapter notes, for example, in managing the country's agingwater infrastructure. ""More than 1,000 community water systems—primarily servingolder adultsand people who are economically disadvantaged, rural, Indigenous, or with less education—are already providing poor-quality water and are not prepared to cope with climate change-driven flooding, drought, and waterborne diseases,"" the authors wrote.""Water is critical to all communities,"" said Heather Tanana, co-author and Visiting Professor at the University of California, Irvine. ""Although climate impacts to water vary across the United States, the NCA5 provides important information on how water cycle changes disproportionately affect certain communities, including Tribes. The report is a valuable tool to understand and address these inequities.""Imtiaz Rangwala, a co-author on the water chapter added that the report details many other examples of how climate change is and will impact bothwater qualityand water availability in challenging ways.""Stories of climate change are largely stories of water, whether we are talking about droughts, desertification, wildfire, or floods,"" said Rangwala, the lead climate scientist at the North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center (NC CASC).In the NCA5 Overview, the US Global Change Research Program highlighted reasons for hope: ""U.S. emissions have decreased, while the economy and population have grown,"" the report states. And ""Efforts to adapt to climate change and reduce net greenhouse gas emissions are underway in every U.S. region and have expanded since 2018.""Today, the NCA5 is in the hands of Congress and decision-makers so they can understand the current implications of climate change, including impacts on water, and what the country can expect in the future. Payton and the lead authors of other chapters are in Washington D.C. for the unveiling of the report, and they will spend the next few weeks and months discussing findings with various stakeholders and the general public in online webinars and regional workshops.""There are few, if any, benign consequences fromclimate change, and the impacts will be felt largely through changes in water,"" said Payton. ""But there is momentum in the water resources community to prepare and adapt for the changes we're seeing now and expect to experience in the future.""","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'nc']",gb,False,False

Heavy rainfall and flash flooding are having ""devastating"" consequences for 3.8 million people already displaced within Somalia. The rain comes in the wake of intersecting crises; three decades of conflict coupled with the worst drought in 40 years has led tounprecedented levelsof mass displacement and overcrowding in informal camps. ""Many areas have been left completely cut off, with bridges and roads destroyed,"" said Abdulkadir Ibrahim, director of communications at the Somali Red Crescent Society (SRCS). He told ABC News that the situation in the country's central city of Beledweyne is critical. ""90% of the population and the outlying villages have been displaced, whilst the remaining 10% are under siege. The latrine and shallow wells have been destroyed."" Videos filmed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) show residents in Beledweyne wading through waist-deep water and clinging to bridges to escape floodwater that Ibrahim (SRCS) confirms is contaminated. The intensity and volume of rainfall this Deyr rainy season, which usually runs from October to December, has been exacerbated by two weather phenomena occurring simultaneously: El Niño and the Indian Ocean Dipole, both linked to sea surface temperatures, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said. ""It would be very, very difficult, even in normal circumstances, to deal with the impacts of these floods"", said Nazanine Moshiri, senior climate and security analyst at conflict resolution thinktank Crisis Group, speaking to ABC News from Nairobi. ""Somalia's just come out of two and a half years of drought, you have deforestation and an al-Shabab militant insurgency, which is affecting and hampering humanitarian aid and pushing displacement,"" Moshiri said. ""All of this has hampered any kind of resilience building in Somalia."" Baidoa, a large southwestern city, has seen an influx of some 6,000 people since the beginning of October. Many have arrived after fleeing drought, conflict or flooding. The city now has one of Somalia's largest displaced populations, estimated at about 650,000 by the IOM. Many people moving to Baidoa have lost animals or farmland and fled to the city in the hope of accessing NGO and government support, Aliow Mohamed, Islamic Relief's country director in Somalia, told ABC News from Mogadishu. ""People are just left with nothing,"" Mohamed said. About 250,00 people living in Baidoa's informal settlements had been impacted by the flash floods as of Nov. 6, IOM said. Mohamed said the makeshift camps have been destroyed. ""It's a flat city, there is no higher ground for people to move to, there is no way for the water to be drained, it's only a matter of time before we start seeing cases of malaria and waterborne diseases,"" Mohamed said. According to the University of Notre Dame's Country Ranking on vulnerability, Somalia is the second most vulnerable country in the world to climate change. Moshiri told ABC News that more research is needed before the ""hugely complex links"" between the recent flooding and human-induced climate change are confirmed. ""What we can say for sure, is that climate change made drought in Somalia more likely, and because of the drought, the impacts of the flooding are much more pronounced,"" she said. A World Weather Attribution report found human-induced climate change made the drought in the Horn of Africa stronger and '100 times more likely'. Moshiri predicts Somalia's drought-flood cycles will become more extreme if nothing is done to reduce global emissions. ""It'll be very difficult to live in a country where 80% of people survive on rain fed agriculture,"" Moshiri said. Somalia's Disaster Management Agency (SoDMA) scaled up preparedness efforts in anticipation of the El Nino rains. A new early warning system plays a recorded flood warning message from SoDMA when any telephone number is dialed regardless of whether the call is made in an area controlled by al-Shabab or without internet. Despite early warning efforts, the U.N. predicts 3.7 million acres of farmland could be destroyed this rainy season. Samer Jarjouhi, who oversees ICRC's programs in Somalia, told ABC News that floods impact will be hard felt as it coincides with planting season. ""The farmers I have spoken to are apprehensive that their crops may be swept away. If this plays out, it will only deepen the country's already dire food insecurity problem,"" Jarjouhi said. Abdullahi Hassan, a farmer from Beledweyne, a flood-prone town in the central Hirshabelle region of Somalia, told ICRC: ""Your livelihood is swept away, and you must start from scratch"". ""You come back to bare soil. My whole family is dependent on this farm,"" he said.","['unitedkingdom', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'ecuador', 'kenya', 'mexico']",us,False,False

The World Bank said that the number of poor people in Kenya could increase by 1.1 million by 2050 if there is ""inaction against climate change"".""Furthermore, death and illness due to malaria and water borne diseases are expected to increase by 56 percent and 10 percent respectively by 2050,"" the Washington-based lender said.

Why will I want to be a goalkeeper as short as I was?What made you pursue music?I have always been music inclined, ever since I can remember, but when I decided to say ‘yes, I want to do music’ was when I entered university, because I did not want to be a 9-5 person, I didn’t want to be thinking after school, what’s next? So I had to think about it for a long time so when I left, I decided to do it professionally. That whole thought process in school was what helped me know that music is what I wanted to do, and since my 100level in University till now, music is what I have been doing.What are some of the biggest things you’ve accomplished as a musician and producer?I would say the biggest thing I have accomplished is seeing people from different races singing my music. That was a very big thing for me to accomplish, let’s just say people accepting what I created in my bedroom. I would go outside at times and see people dancing to my music, that is the biggest achievement among other things I have achieved, even though this is just the beginning.Who would you say are some of the biggest names you’ve worked with, and what are some of the biggest things that you are hoping to work with?Well, of course CKay because he was the first, then Davido, Mayorkun, Ayra Starr, and for those I still want to work with, names like Drake, Ed Sheeran, Travis Scott, and more big names like that.Do you watch the Super Eagles?Sometimes, and I am a fan of them when they are doing great things, like when they beat Sao Tome 10-0.We have one of the best attacks now in Africa heading into the AFCON next year, what do you make of the Super Eagles chances of winning a fourth AFCON title in Tunisia?Well, I know many people don’t like to count on the Super Eagles but Victor Osimhen is there and if he is fit, I know I can count on Osimhen. He is a wonderful player, and I can give them a chance of winning the Africa Cup of Nations if he is there, as long as Osimhen is there, they have a good chance.What football club do you support?I am a Manchester United fan.Ever since Sir Alex Ferguson left, Man United have not achieved success similar to his time, do you think the glory days are over?Obviously not, and I personally don’t think that Erik Ten Hag is the right man to coach the club. However, I believe that Man United is just in their drought season and every club has to pass through that drought season in one period or other. I know this is the tenth year since we last won the Premier League title, but I want you to believe this, when Man United is coming back, we will come back stronger. We just need to structure some things, both the management and everything. It may take another ten years of drought, but we will still come back stronger. Trust the process.In your opinion, who do you think is the greatest man United player that ever ?Related NewsGovernorship Election Live UpdatesMessi celebrates Ballon d'Or with MLS fans but Miami fall in friendlyLord, have Messi on Fury and bless Ngannou (2)Osimhen ranked eighth, Messi claims eight Ballon d’OrFor me, it is a tough choice between David Beckham or Cristiano Ronaldo, I did not really watch Beckham for that long in Man United, he had moved on to Madrid then, but I know he did a lot of very great things at the club. For Ronaldo, I know I watched him a lot, so based on who I watched the most, I would say Cristiano ‘ororo’ Ronaldo, just a very amazing player all around.Was he the one who made you fall in love with United?Yes, it was Cristiano Ronaldo. I think I started watching him in 2008 and in that Champions League that year, he was just so amazing. He also scored in the final against Chelsea, although he missed the penalty, but I was very glad that they could win that UCL trophy. It was a very good season for us and I was so happy then.Who is your favourite Nigerian player?It can only be Victor Osimhen o. I mean, he is their best player, who else? It is very obvious he is their best, when he does not play, you can see the difference in the team. I mean he was ranked 8th on the Balon d’Or list this year, no one else can compare right now.Do you think he can win the Balon d’Or one day?Yes, I think he can, nothing is impossible. He is a very good footballer, there are many good footballers right now but if he keeps on going at this pace, and gives his all, he can win it. I don’t think it is impossible for him.Osimhen is your favourite, but in your opinion, who do you think is our greatest Nigerian player ever?It’s between Nwankwo Kanu and Jay-Jay Okocha. They both brought very different things to the Super Eagles but the end result was always scoring goals. For Okocha, a lot of footballers around the world talk about how he inspired them even Ronaldinho who is one of the greatest payers every. Kanu represented Nigeria well at home and abroad, everyone seems to be able to relate with his ‘grass to grace’ story. He is up there, the two of them are up there among the very best Africa has ever seen.What do you think that Nigeria needs to do to the level of Morocco who got to the World Cup semi-final in Qatar?We already have the players that are on their level, if you ask me. I don’t think it’s the players, I think it’s the government. If they are not giving the players the support they need, they won’t play at their best. The players need to be in the right state of mind to play the football in a way that the country will be proud of them.If you had a chance to go on a date with any female sports person, who would it be?I would go with Michelle Alozie.Speaking of Alozie, what do you think of what the Falcons achieved at the Women’s World Cup?I was very proud of them, I know Alozie even missed a penalty but I was very proud of her and the girls. They locked England down and could have won that game. I am sure they will do better in future tournaments. They look like they have it better figured out than the Eagles.If your child is interested in playing football, are you going to encourage him?Why not? I think I already have plans to do my own ‘Project Mbappe’ actually. If my child can play like Kylian Mbappe, I will go and register him in a football academy very fast.Who do you think is the GOAT, Ronaldo or Lionel Messi?It’s Messi. I know I said Ronaldo inspired me to like Man United and I think he is their greatest player but that is at a fan level and I have to be honest with myself. Messi has just done a lot of things that you cannot say he is not the GOAT. Everything is just pointing to him being the greatest player of all time. And I can relate to Messi’s story, aside us being around the same height, his drive and heart and just to see the fact that he doesn’t do any other thing than focus on the football. It is very great to see.

Since the beginning of November, more than 795,000 displacements have been recorded in Somalia. Many of the affected, particularly in the southern and central parts of the country, were already internally displaced due to conflict and drought. Homes have been extensively damaged or destroyed and, in some locations, people are sheltering under trees on higher ground. There are also tragic reports of drownings. In Ethiopia's Somali Region, authorities estimate more than 20 people have died, while over half a million people have been affected by flash floods. Close to 40,000 families, or around 240,000 people, including those seeking safety from ongoing conflict in Somalia, have been displaced, more than half of them in the Dollo Ado and Bokolmayo districts. Across five settlements, 213,000 refugees have also suffered the effects of the flooding. Clean and safe drinking water is scarce, accessing health services is difficult and nearly 1,000 families have lost their shelters. In spite of such hardships, many refugees have made generous contributions to support members of the host communities who have also been impacted by the heavy rains. Nearly 25,000 people in Kenya's Dadaab refugee camps have been affected by the floods, with many seeking refuge in schools within the camps as well as in nearby communities. Some refugees have also opened up their homes to host the newly displaced, leading to overcrowding in many households. Flooded roads have hindered the movement of people, making it particularly difficult for vulnerable people to access services, including for pregnant women to reach hospitals. In Kakuma camp, 100 families were forced to move to safer areas due to massive soil erosion from the rains. Beyond displacement, people's livelihoods have been gravely affected. In one location in southern Ethiopia, over 65 percent of the land is reportedly covered by flood waters. Meanwhile, over 1,000 livestock have died, and another 1,000 hectares of crops have been wiped out in the Somali Region, risking the worsening of an already dire food situation. The sanitation situation is greatly concerning as hundreds of communal latrines have been damaged, putting people at risk of infectious diseases, including cholera. In addition, many roads have been ruined, impacting people's access to critical services such as health. People's most immediate needs are for food, emergency shelter, kitchen sets, blankets and other relief items, clean water and hygiene services. Families living in flood-prone areas also need urgent support to relocate to higher grounds. UNHCR and partners are distributing relief items to the newly displaced, as well as dignity kits to affected women and girls. Families are also receiving cash assistance to buy local building materials to repair or reinforce shelters and meet other urgent needs. Sandbags have been provided to protect people from flood waters. Urgent donor support is needed to deliver assistance and protection and to save lives as the rains continue, and as the impact of climate change is felt by the most vulnerable. The floods come barely months after the longest and most severe drought on record, the impacts of which are still being felt by millions of people in the East and Horn of Africa.","['ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia']",us,False,False

Among the greatest needs are food, emergency shelter, kitchen sets, blankets, clean water and hygiene services. Families living in flood-prone areas also require urgent support to relocate to higher ground. Damage, destruction and drownings More than 795,000 displacements have been recorded in Somalia alone, where many of those uprooted had already been forced to flee conflict and drought. ""Homes have been extensively damaged or destroyed and, in some locations, people are sheltering under trees on higher ground. There are also tragic reports of drownings,"" said UNHCR Spokesperson William Spindler, speaking in Geneva. Flash floods in Ethiopia's Somali Region have affected more than half a million people, and upwards of 20 have died, according to the authorities. Close to 40,000 families, including those seeking safety from the ongoing conflict in neighbouring Somalia, are also on the run. A helping hand Mr. Spindler said 213,000 refugees across five settlements have also suffered. Nearly 1,000 families have lost their shelter, he added, noting that both clean and safe drinking water is scarce. Access to health services has also been impeded. ""In spite of such hardships, many refugees have made generous contributions to support members of the host communities who have also been impacted by the heavy rains,"" he said. Meanwhile, some 25,000 people at the Dadaab refugee camps in northeast Kenya have also been impacted, with many seeking shelter in schools at the complex or in nearby communities. Some refugees are also hosting the newly displaced in their homes, leading to overcrowding. ""Flooded roads have hindered the movement of people, making it particularly difficult for vulnerable people to access services, including for pregnant women to reach hospitals,"" said Mr. Spindler. Another 100 families at the Kakuma camp in northwest Kenya also were forced to move due to massive soil erosion from the rains. Livestock and incomes lost Mr. Spindler noted that livelihoods also have been ""gravely affected"" by the flooding. He gave the example of one location in southern Ethiopia, where over 65 per cent of the land is now reportedly under water. ""Meanwhile, over 1,000 livestock have died, and another 1,000 hectares of crops have been wiped out in the Somali Region, risking the worsening of an already dire food situation,"" he added.

Kadam, who did his MTech in Civil Engineering from the Sangli-based Rajarambapu Institute of Technology, eventually decided to close his construction business and join hands with Deshmukh to develop and commercialise onion seeders and transplanters. The firm went on to win the government’s RAFAR grant and now exports these machines. Currently, they aim to bring about complete mechanisation in the farming of onions – a crop known for its intense labour requirement. Traditionally, Kadam’s family grew cane on their nearly 30 acres of land in Ahmednagar district’s Rahuri tehsil. “Maharashtra went through a series of droughts between 2013 and 2015. With water becoming scarce, we had to look for a crop that grew in a shorter period and was commercially viable. Onion was the first choice given it grew in just three to four months,” he said. Onion was a new crop in Rahuri and the first thing that struck them was the labour-intensive nature it demanded. Kadam and Deshmukh were part of the Shetkariraja Male Self-Help Group (SHG) which was active in the region. Before long, the topic of discussion turned to onions and the problems faced by those growing it. “Labour was a problem and so was the manner in which farmers used to plant the crop. Seed companies advocated the usage of 3 kg of seed per acre but that was because the farmers relied on the broadcast method of plantation (throwing seeds on the soil surface). This resulted in losses and precision was less,” he said. Kadam decided to take matters into his hands and devised a machine that managed to reduce both the amount of seeds required as well as the labour involved. The mechanical seeder was easy to use and could be operated manually. “Onion seeds are very delicate so the seeders available in the market could not be used. Our machine took care of this aspect as it was manually operated,” he explained. The first machine was manufactured by the duo in 2015 and they have since managed to sell around 300 such machines annually. In 2019, Kadam and Deshmukh decided to float a company when they realised the larger potential of their innovation and the market for it. In 2020, the firm was recognised under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY)’s Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sector Rejuvenation (RAFAR). This saw the company get an investment of Rs 15 lakh as well as incubation facilities at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) in Kashipur, Uttarakhand. “Though the training was imparted online during theCOVID-19pandemic, it was of great use to us and helped us clarify our vision,” he added. Onion – especially the rabi crop grown in winter – has to be transplanted, and thus the next innovation from the company was a transplanter. The machine is mounted on a tractor and helps in precise transplantation of the onion saplings. “Transplantation is a very labour-intensive job. Our machine manages to cut down the labour cost and increase precision. Thus farmers are able to get better returns,” he pointed out. As things turned out, it is the transplanter that has caught the fancy of international buyers. “Soon after it was launched last year, we started getting queries from other onion-growing nations. The first machine was exported to Morocco in April 2023 which was followed by one to Tanzania. Our last export was to Palestine just before the present war erupted,” he said. At present, the company is bootstrapped with extensive research being carried out to make the transplanter more user-friendly “Our business is linked to the realisation of the commodity. Hence the current downturn in prices has not augured well with us. Our main aim now is to work on end-to-end mechanisation in onion farming – something which has never been attempted before,” he said.","['bhutan', 'bhutan', 'bhutan', 'bhutan', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'morocco', 'tanzania', 'palestinianterritories']",in,True,True

They're accustomed to using their four semi-trucks to take the harvest from a total of about 800 acres each of corn, soybeans and wheat to market. What they're not used to are the distances they've had to drive the past couple years, a consequence of bad weather that's only expected to increase in their area as a result of climate change. They used to take advantage of a grain elevator in Mayfield, Kentucky — a massive facility that bought and stored millions of bushels of grain from farmers. But it was destroyed in the 2021 tornado outbreak that killed dozens of people and leveled entire parts of the town, and the company that ran it shut down. Now, instead of driving ten minutes, they sometimes travel an hour or more. “The swings in the weather events that we have ... that’s kind of scary,” he said, especially for those with smaller farms. “If you’ve got a larger farm operation, your acreage is spread out over a larger area, so the risks are probably minimized more because they’re spread out more.” Farmers and experts echo Ralph and say that larger farms have more ways to manage risk, but smaller to midsize farmers struggle when extreme weather hits. Human-caused climate change is only anticipated to amplify the number and intensity of those extreme events, from flash droughts to increased rainfall. And as the planet warms, scientists say the country will see more tornado- and hail-spawning storms and that those deadly events will strike more frequently in populous mid-Southern states a big issue for everyone living in those areas and especially for those trying to hold onto small family farms. That's already a reality for the area around Mayfield, which is in a flat coastal plain region in the western part of the state and which has been hit by extreme weather in more ways than one. In addition to the 2021 tornado outbreak, this summer they were hit by flooding that surpassed 10 inches in some areas, submerging crops. Keith Lowry, another farmer near Mayfield, woke up one morning this summer to eight inches of rain, and by dinner time, when the deluge finally stopped, knew he had a problem. Lowry found fields of half-submerged corn, soybeans that had disappeared under the flooding almost entirely and rapids rushing from their spillway like a waterfall. Now, at harvest time, he estimates that they lost between five and 10% of their crop this year. What’s more, they had to deal with the debris that had washed into their fields, a nuisance that gets in the way of heavy machinery. Lowry has a relatively big operation — 3,000 acres, mostly in corn and soybeans, along with another 2,000 acres his son farms. Although he took some losses, he says that he and other farmers are used to dealing with uncooperative weather. “That’s the nature of the beast,” he said. But without the grain elevator or on-farm storage and with limitedtransportationoptions, Lowry explained that his neighbors would have been stuck with soybeans in their fields. That's why a cloudy day this November found him helping out on a much smaller parcel of land, to bring in a harvest from about 250 acres. While farmers and town residents have leaned on each other to be resilient, the compounding effect of those natural disasters has had lasting impacts on a community where agriculture is at the heart of commerce. “Because we have such a big county that’s really heavily populated with grain farmers, the loss of (the grain elevator) has forced them to move to surrounding counties, oftentimes 40 or 50 miles away to transport their grain,” said Miranda Rudolph, the University of Kentucky's cooperative extension agent for Graves County. She said that fuel costs have risen, adding to the strain. Hans Schmitz, a conservation agronomist with Purdue's extension agency, said that large farms tend to have a wider range of options to balance out their risk, including crop insurance, which often costs less per acre when applied to larger areas. Jed Clark, for example, who farms about 3,000 acres of grain near Mayfield, said that he relies on crop insurance and also tries to spread out his crop rotations strategically, betting that crops in a low-lying area will do well in a dry year and that crops on higher ground will outlast the ones that are washed out when it floods. On smaller farms, if farmers are forced to put everything in a low-lying area that floods, an entire crop can be affected, Schmitz said. Farmers with less land therefore sometimes look toward specialty crops like watermelon or tomato to try to increase profits with the acreage they have, but those crops are not as easily insured. Schmitz said he thinks that climate change is contributing to the consolidation of farmland — that is, large farms getting larger. It’s relatively easy for a very small farm to get started, but harder to stay afloat. “What concerns me is the hollowing out of the middle,” he said. The capability of a smaller farm to survive also has to do with infrastructure, said Adam Kough, another Kentucky farmer who has a mostly family-run 1200 acres of corn, soybeans and wheat (as well as two swine barns and 100 sheep) between Mayfield and Murray. He thinks the farmers who were hurt the most after the tornado were those who didn't have grain storage on their land. Kough said he has noticed changes in the weather over the years, but he thinks a corporate mentality has more to do with why big farms will always get bigger. “People have changed more than the weather has,” he said. “The morals have changed in the last 20 years ... I call it cutthroat."" Still, the weather impacts are undeniable. Schmitz, who also farms about 1200 acres of corn, soybeans and wheat in Indiana, says that he's seen increasing summertime humidity foster diseases of wheat, barley and oats in the Midwest. He's seen higher nighttime temperatures induce more heat stress on most crops. And he said that while some farmers turn to irrigation to get them through sudden and intense droughts — he's seen those same irrigation pivots end up in standing water after intense and sudden floods. “It goes back to the old saying that in the Midwest, ‘if you don’t like the weather, wait 5 minutes.' We certainly always have had the capacity for pretty significant changes in weather over a short period of time,” he said. “But to see climate change exacerbating those potential extremes both ways within a short period of time is disconcerting.” ___ Associated Press journalist Joshua Bickel contributed to this report. ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Melina Walling on X, formerly known as Twitter: @MelinaWalling. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Ustrell is one of scores of European winemakers struggling to grow enough grapes asextreme and unseasonable weatherbecomes more commonplace. High input costs and declining consumption are adding to the woes of small, independent wineries. According to the International Organisation for Vine and Wine (OIV), an industry group, global wine production isset to fallto its lowest level since 1961 this year, hit by soaring temperatures and extraordinary flooding. Fueling that decline are expected drops of 12% and 14% in output in Italy and Spain, the world’s biggest and third-biggest producers in 2022, respectively. Climate change is having a “tremendous” impact on wine production, Giogio Delgrosso, head ﻿of statistics at the OIV, told CNN. Delgrosso said that, in the past, extreme weather would strike every few years to interrupt long stretches of healthy, abundant harvests. “Now extreme climate events are always happening. Every year there’s something.” This year, heavy rainfall has helped mold spread through vineyards in central and southern Italy, while a severe drought and soaring temperatures have blighted vineyards in Spain. Other major wine producers, including Australia, South Africa and Chile, are expected to suffer drops of between 10% and 24% in output this year, according to OIV data, as floods, wildfires, droughts, and fungal disease have hammered vineyards. The changing climate is helping others, however. Output in the United States, the world’s fourth-largest producer, is forecast to grow 12% this year. Greg Jones, a climatologist and chief executive of Abacela, an Oregon-based winery, told CNN that, half a century ago, the state couldn’t grow grapes. Now, he said, rising temperatures have made Oregon “one of the top producing regions in the country.” Ust﻿rell in Spain has come to live with the unpredictable weather. For about two years now, it has hardly rained in Gratallops, which lies about 90 miles west of Barcelona. That has put serious stress on Ustrell’s vines. And snow, which seeps into the deepest layers of the soil, providing moisture for the vines during the dry summer months, hasn’t fallen once in that time. It’s little surprise, then, that Ustrell’s harvest of Cabernet Sauvignon — a variety of red wine grapes traditionally grown in France’s Bordeaux region, where conditions are more humid — was the first to, as he put it, “collapse” this year. Vineyards in Gratallops are so parched, he added, that 26 of its 28 wineries, including Celler Devinssi, have recently formed an association to lobby local authorities for funding to improve the water supply for irrigation, even if that means delivering huge vats of water into the town via truck. Celler Devinssi is not at risk of closure, but the 23-year-old firm’s bank account will almost certainly “be in the red” this year, according to Ustrell. Across the border, French winemakers are grappling with the opposite problem: Too much wine﻿. France is on track to pip Italy to become the world’s biggest producer this year, according to OIV data, up from second place in 2022. The country maintained the same level of production as last year thanks to more favorable weather. But the burgeoning supply of wine has exceeded waning demand in France and abroad, pushing down prices. The mismatch prompted French and European Union authorities toannouncea joint €200 million ($217 million) buyback scheme this summer, allowing French winemakers to sell their excess stock to distilleries for recycling into other alcoholic products like hand sanitizer. Falling prices have coincided with rising input costs. Over the past two years, a mix of soaring inflation and historically highenergy priceshas jacked up the cost of inputs like fertilizer, bottles and transportation fuel. Add to that higher interest rates, which have made borrowing to invest much costlier, and many winemakers’ already-narrow profit margins have all but disappeared. French winemakers struggling to sell their own produce have taken out their anger on imports from Spain. Hundreds of them descended on a major cross-border highway last month and stormed trucks transporting Spanish wine into France. The protestors smashed crates and emptied gallons of imported wine onto the road. Frédéric Rouanet, who organized the demonstration, explained to CNN that Spain makes many lower-priced wines and said the message to merchants was clear: “If you want to get cheap wine from Spain, you’ll have to buy our wine from us first.” Otherwise, said Rouanet, who runs an association of winemakers in Aude in France, the region’swineries simply “can’t get by.” Meanwhile, people around the world are drinking less wine than in previous years, opting for beer or spir﻿its instead, or ditching alcohol altogether. Globally, wine consumption has fallen about 6% between 2017 and 2022, OIV data shows, as consumers have changed their drinking habits andinflation has erodedtheir disposable income. That means nearly 1.9 billionfewer wine bottles were drunk last year than in 2017. Estimates for this year,citedby the European Commission in June, show even steeper declines across European countries, suggesting the trend may be accelerating. The multiplepressures have forced some vineyards to close their doors. Michael Baynes, co-founder of Vineyards-Bordeaux Christie’s International Real Estate, an investment advisory specializing in vineyards, said the number of winemakers selling up, while still a tiny fraction of all Bordeaux producers, had “dramatically increased” this year. “It’s a bloodbath,” he told CNN. “We’re seeing some very sad stories at the moment. A lot of multigeneration families are losing estates that they’ve nurtured for many years.” Their problems started 20 years ago, Baynes said, when Bordeaux’s lower-priced wines were forced into competition with “New World” wines — such as those from Chile, Argentina and Australia — that were rising in popularity. Surviving family-run wineries, and larger wineries selling into the lower end of the market, are in a precarious position, Baynes said. A bad harvest, a newexport tariff, anotherinterest rate hikecan be all it takes for a generations-old winery to shut for good. And “jittery and nervous” lenders aren’t coming to the rescue of wineries they suspect would struggle to repay expensiveloans, he added. “They are turning off the tap of lending.” “The families, the generations, the blood, sweat and toil that has gone into creating a lovely product may be lost forever.” Climate change was the reason John Mitra sold the Bordeaux vineyard he owned with his wife, Penelope, last year as it made predicting each year’s harvest too difficult. “It’s just too risky,” he told CNN. “Some years you would get 3,000 bottles off a hectare. Other years, you’d end up with 50. Unless you have substantial financial backing behind you, you can’t operate.” The couple have since moved 340 miles east to establish The Burgundy Wine Company, a merchant specializing in wines produced by small, independent vineyards. They chose the Burgundy region because it is very small, and so the wine produced there — less available, more coveted — fetches higher prices than wine ﻿from many other places. More and more of Mitra’s suppliers and friends in the industry are deciding to sell their vineyards, or taking advantage of a French government subsidy to uproot their vines and replant the land with new crops, or to simply turn it over to woodland. Some have replaced their vines with olive trees and kiwi plants, he said, because they are more resistant to drought. Mitra misses his previous occupation. For 12 months, through “rain or freezing cold,” he and his wife would tend to their vines. The two or three days spent harvesting the grapes each year made it all worthwhile, he said. Still, Mitra is happy to have chartered a new path in an industry he adores, and feels lucky to still be living among France’s fabled vineyards. “Now I just walk my dog in the vines, rather than own them.”","['spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'australia', 'australia', 'southafrica', 'chile', 'chile', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'argentina']",us,True,False

[+] Palestinian targets in the northern Gaza Strip January 1, 2009 as seen from Israel's border. (Photo by David Silverman/Getty Images) First, it is important to acknowledge that in the case of ongoing conflicts such as the one between Israel and Hamas, the war in Ukraine and the coup in Niger, wounds are still fresh and complexities of the human cost grow each day. But it’s also important to consider the environmental impacts of conflicts around the world, which could take generations to reverse. The conflict in Ukraine, since 2014 and especially with Russia's invasion in 2022, has resulted in casualties, refugees and economic turmoil. It has also caused air, water, land and soil pollution, damaging ecosystems and posing hazards to neighboring countries. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute noted more than 2,000 instances of what would qualify as environmental crimes under Ukraine’s criminal code. This is particularly disturbing because Drs. Jiayi Zhou and Ian Anthony published findings that Ukraine is home to 35% of Europe’s biodiversity. Hundreds of protected areas are currently or have been under occupation. That includes roughly 23 national parks as well as nature and biosphere reserves. Being under occupation means the areas are exposed to waste and pollution associated with military equipment and supplies. Explosions and chemicals used in warfare have contaminated soil and water, causing what the European Parliament estimates to be more than $55 billion in environmental damage. Meanwhile, the fallout from the July coup in Niger continues. The conflict’s roots in resentment against France over resource extraction (Uranium, oil, gas) combine with the land degradation associated with conflict to create a political and climate crisis. The International Rescue Committee reports that drought-flood cycles have led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. Tensions around the military junta have made humanitarian assistance extremely limited and climate remediation impossible. This highlights the idea that the combined effects of climate change and armed conflict are leading to increased humanitarian needs, displacement and food insecurity. Aid agencies have called for additional support from the international community to help them deliver food aid and other assistance in Niger. Then there is the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Similar to Ukraine and Niger, the conflict has led to catastrophic destruction of critical infrastructure, leaving Gaza without energy resources and water at points. The dense nature of the area made the human impact of the situation more acute. Included in the cascading impacts of the conflict are the environmental damage and public health crises. The continued damage to wastewater infrastructure in Gaza due to attacks and explosive weapons use is of concern now, but it was already suffering from the impacts of decades of conflict. The results are poor water, sanitation and hygiene provisions, alongside uncontrolled discharge of untreated wastewater. Long term, these can cause sickness and increase the rate of chronic illness. Agriculture and water access will also be affected. The bombings and missile attacks also contribute to the environmental threat. Munitions generally contain heavy metals and other “forever chemicals” that can remain a threat to the health of both humans and ecosystems for decades after the end of any conflict. These chemicals impact air and soil quality as well as water quality. Because of the repeated waves of conflict in the area, there is damage to the built environment and natural systems like fauna and tree cover. This makes Gaza and nearby areas prone to drought-flood cycles. With the latest climate change projections indicating potential increases in extreme rainfall, this situation will only worsen. In addition to a growing list of troubles, all of Israel will have to contend with reduced climate resilience. Similar to Ukraine and Niger, continual armed conflict hinders opportunities for remediation and investment. The conflict and the continued use of explosive weapons reduce Gaza's climate resilience, given existing infrastructure constraints. Peter Schwartzstein of the Wilson Center writes about the importance of environmental peace-building, “You cannot disconnect the environment and natural resources like water from a conflict’s wider dynamics,” which means both past wins in addressing climate change and present opportunities are lost. There are options, even in times of conflict, to address some of these issues. Under international law, the Geneva Conventions specifically, there are provisions for different kinds of protected areas or “zones.” Demilitarized zones, safety zones and humanitarian corridors are some examples of areas where either no military activity is allowed or temporarily suspended. Several international organizations have called for humanitarian corridors to be opened for allowing emergency food, medicine and evacuation of vulnerable groups. These corridors can also be used for emergency infrastructure repair and water treatment. Demilitarized zones could be created near priority areas for environmental protection, but to preserve critical ecosystems and to create safe areas for the population. Similar concepts have been suggested by the International Committee of the Red Cross. These examples illustrate how wars and armed conflicts not only cause immediate human suffering but also have severe and lasting environmental consequences. The existence of conflict and suggestions for solutions highlight the interconnectedness of environmental, humanitarian and geopolitical issues in conflict zones. For a sustainable future, addressing these topics in and out of times of conflict is essential.","['israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'niger', 'niger', 'niger', 'niger', 'russia', 'france']",us,False,False

Given that many efforts to promote peace have grown increasingly frustrated, to some observers this seems an inauspicious time to award one of humanity’s most coveted accolades. “There’s not a lot of peace around at the moment, so it’s not clear that there’s an outstanding peacemaker to give the award to,” Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), told CNN. But the peace prize can serve as a beacon of hope in fraught and fractured times. “I think it’s precisely in a situation like this that the peace prize becomes particularly important. It’s necessary to point to achievements and to contributions that are important and happen everywhere in the world,” Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), told CNN. The Nobel prizes are notoriously difficult to predict. The Nobel committee announces the number of nominees, but keeps their names closely guarded and does not release a shortlist. But experts have picked out a series of potential frontrunners – while stressing that the committee seems to delight in making surprise choices. This year – as last – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sits atop many bookmakers’ list of laureates-in-waiting. But Nobel specialists have been quick to dismiss such speculation, saying it is rare for the peace award to go to a wartime leader. “It would be like saying in 1941 that (then-British Prime Minister) Winston Churchill should get the Nobel Peace Prize. What he was doing at the time was trying to win a war. That’s what Zelensky is trying to do now,” Smith, of SIPRI, said. “My view is, if and when he gets the chance to lead his country into peace, then he will probably get the award and be widely seen as a very worthy winner,” Smith added. Urdal said that many bookmakers were cynically tipping Zelensky for the award simply because “he’s a well-known name.” “Bookmakers here are trying to find candidates that people are willing to put money on – well, lose money on,” Urdal continued. “I don’t consider that to reflect any real information about the likelihood of him getting the prize.” While the prospect of a wartime leader winning the award appear remote, the war in Ukraine has spurred peacemaking efforts from a number of international organizations who stand a chance of clinching Friday’s honor. Nobel Prize in physics won by trio who created rapid flashes of light to 'capture the shortest of moments' In his annual much-coveted shortlist of frontrunners for the prize, Urdal included the International Court of Justice (ICJ) as a potential candidate, for its efforts to promote peace “through international law, akin to promoting peace congresses, another achievement highlighted in Alfred Nobel’s will (the document that established the Nobel prizes in 1895).” Shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, the ICJ ordered Russia to “immediately suspend military operations.” A related – but potentially more explosive – choice would be the International Criminal Court (ICC), which in March issued anarrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putinfor an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. Signatories to the ICC’s Rome Statute are obliged to arrest Putin if he sets foot in their countries. But while Urdal has tipped both bodies as worthy winners, both they and Zelensky may be overlooked because the past two peace prizes were awarded to advocates and organizations from the same part of the world. The 2022 prize was awarded to human rights groups from Russia and Ukraine – Memorial and the Center for Civil Liberties – and the jailed Belarusian advocateAles Bialiatski. The year before, Russian journalistDmitry Muratovalso shared the award for his efforts to safeguard freedom of expression. Bialiatski remains in prison, while Muratov has been branded a “foreign agent” by a Russian law attempting to limit the freedom of the press. “There have been two prizes in a row now that have pointed to Ukraine specifically and to Russia. I think the committee would likely want to try to point to other geographic areas,” Urdal added. While the award will be announced Friday, recipients do not receive their prizes until an official ceremony in December. By this time, Smith pointed out, the world will be going through an“El Niño” winter– when ocean temperatures are warmer than normal for an extended period. For Smith, El Niño is set to round off a year in which the climate disaster has become clear to all. “I think the hunger stones (which mark historic droughts) appearing in the rivers last year, the most serious drought in China while records have been kept, flooding of 35% of Pakistan – that was 2022,” he said. This year, there have been “wildfires in Canada which producedsmog in New York. Thesargassum(seaweed) that is washing up on the beaches of Mexico in record amounts. Thehottest temperatures everin this place, that place and the other… And as yet El Niño hasn’t kicked in.” Both Smith and Urdal said that climate is likely to be high on the committee’s agenda this year, and suggested that it could be tied to another prominent issue – the rights of indigenous peoples. “Climate change is also threatening the ways of life for many of these indigenous groups,” Urdal said. Awarding a prize to the representative of indigenous groups could be “a good way to connect human rights and group rights to climate change and to environmental issues more broadly.” The rights of indigenous peoples are likely to be “weighing on the committee’s mind,” Urdal continued, because the announcement comes shortly after Norway launched a report on truth and reconciliation in Norwegian society with the country’s indigenous Sami people. In his shortlist, Urdal named Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, a Filipino activist and former chair of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, and Juan Carlos Jintiach, the Ecuadorian leader of the federation representing indigenous organizations in the Amazon basin, as potential winners. Smith also tipped Chief Raoni Metuktire, leader of the Kayapo People in the Brazilian Amazon, who recently spoke at the Amazonia summit convened by Brazil President Lula da Silva, for the award. “We need to be listening a little bit more to indigenous people whose rights can all too easily get trampled over,” Smith added.","['norway', 'norway', 'russia', 'russia', 'russia', 'russia', 'russia', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'china', 'pakistan', 'canada', 'mexico', 'brazil']",us,True,False

A flood that ... [+] started in a glacial lake destroyed a 1,200 megawatt hydropower dam and then washed away homes and bridges, forcing thousands to flee. (Photo by Biplov Bhuyan) Last week, a flood on the Teetsa River swept through villages in the Himalayan mountains of India, taking out bridges and homes. At least 40 people were killed, with more than a hundred people still missing. The root of the disaster appeared to be a natural one, as an avalanche sent ice and boulders tumbling into a large glacial lake, causing it to overflow as a wall of water that surged downstream. But, as with most disasters, it’s hard to call this one strictly “natural” because human-caused climate change has made this type of event—a “glacial lake outburst flood”—more likely. As the massive wave swept downstream, it obliterated the Teetsa-3 dam, a 1200 megawatt hydropower dam that was only a decade old and cost 1.5 billion USD to construct. This sudden loss of major infrastructure underscores another risk that climate change is amplifying: the vulnerability of hydropower and other dams to damage or destruction from floods that will continue to grow in magnitude. South Lhonak Glacial Lake (upper red box and upper right photo) and the Teetsa III Hydropower Dam ... [+] (lower red box and lower right photo). A ""glacial lake outburst flood"" from South Lhonak destroyed the 1,200 MW Teetsa III dam and also killed at least 40 people. Beyond the loss of expensive infrastructure, this rising flood risk to dams can pose real danger to people living downstream, as was tragically demonstrated last month in Libya when more than 10,000 people were killed the flood unleashed by the collapse of two dams on the Wadi Derna during record-breaking precipitation (note that these were not hydropower dams and the structures had not been maintained in the war-torn country). Left side: The Mansour Dam, before and after it and another upstream dam failed (on September 11, ... [+] 2023). Right side: The city of Derna Libya, before and after the dam-collapse floods devastated the city. These are not isolated incidents, as examples can be found around the world. In 2017, California’s Oroville Dam, the tallest dam in North America, came close to failing—unleashing what would have been a disastrous flood for hundreds of thousands of people living downstream—due to record-breaking precipitation and runoff. Floods damaged hydropower dams and triggered downstream evacuations in Puerto Rico in 2017 and Colombia in 2018. In May of 2020, between four and seven inches of rain drenched central Michigan over a two-day period, resulting in flooding that led to the collapse of two hydropower dams and the evacuation of more than 10,000 people downstream as downtown Midland, Michigan was inundated by nearly 10 feet of water.

[+] the lower part of downtown Midland (MI) on May 20, 2020 following the upstream failure of two hydropower dams. (Photo by Gregory Shamus) While Oroville was a near miss and, due to warnings and evacuations, the Michigan floods were not deadly, a much greater catastrophe occurred in Laos in 2018, when heavy rains led to the collapse of a portion of a hydropower dam, releasing a flash flood with a volume half that of the Mississippi River. The flood rapidly inundated nearly 20 square miles, displacing 6,000 people and killing at least 36 people. These recent events are happening at a time when only 4% of all current hydropower dams are located within areas with the greatest risk of flooding – but that proportion will grow dramatically due to climate change over the next thirty years. I recently led research showing that, by 2050, the proportion of hydropower dams in regions with the highest flood risk will increase five times, to 20% of dams, due to projected climate change driving increases in flood magnitudes across much of the world. Distribution of existing hydropower dams with color indicating the projected change in relative ... [+] flood risk in 2050 under the pessimistic climate scenario. The size of the circle reflects the hydropower capacity of the dam. Further, proposed dams in the planning stage are disproportionately located in regions where flood risks will increase the most: only 2% of currently planned dams are located in regions that today are classified as having the highest flood risk. But by 2050, 40% of all planned dams will be in the regions with the highest risk. These numbers are based on the same set of planned dams; it’s the regions where they are located that are predicted to change over the next three decades. (See this interactive map to explore current and future flood risk for hydropower dams around the world.) The current and rising risk of floods to hydropower, and other, underscores three main points. First is the absolute necessity of minimizing climate change. Global flood losses (all river floods, not just dam-related) will increase quite a bit even if we successfully hit the most ambitious climate target (keeping warming below 1.5° C). With that level of warming, the number of people exposed to river flooding is projected to increase by 50–60% and flood damages are projected to increase by 160–240%. Warming of 2° C would result in a doubling of the people affected by floods and an increase in damages up to 520% compared to today. This is a surprisingly large increase in losses relative to warming of 1.5° C, underscoring that seemingly small differences in temperature can have major differences in disruption to people’s lives. Second is the need to dramatically increase investment in adaptation to climate change. As noted above, flood risk will still rise considerably even if we hold warming to 1.5° C – meaning considerable adaptation will still be needed. There are a number of steps we can take to reduce risks associated with dam failure, encompassing both engineering interventions and Nature-based Solutions. These include retrofitting spillways to safely pass larger floods, managing watersheds to reduce runoff, and integrating better monitoring and forecasting into dam operations. Countries can adapt to increasing flood risk by giving rivers more room to spread out, and avoiding new development in areas at risk of flooding. However, the financial challenge is stark. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that current investment in adaptation is only 5 – 10% of what is needed. Moreover, many countries aren’t even keeping up with the maintenance and rehabilitation needed for current levels of risk. For example, the American Society of Civil Engineers gives a letter grade of “D” to both dams and levees in the United States, noting that rehabilitating these structures to maintain their safety will require more than $100 billion in investment. Removal of aging and obsolete dams is gaining increasing attention as a solution for improving safety - while simultaneously being one of the most dramatic ways to restore river ecosystems (see this earlier post). In the United States, this synergy underpins the collaborative efforts of the hydropower sector, river conservation organizations and Tribes to secure funding for upgrading some dams while removing others, resulting in $2.3 billion in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill for these actions. Beyond climate mitigation and adaptation, the rising flood risk to dams underscores the need to change how we plan future infrastructure. Such planning needs to be based on comprehensive assessments of both current and future risks. In addition to rising flood risk, hydropower dams also face increasing risk from water scarcity that will result in reduced generation, generally during times of greatest demand for electricity, such as during heat waves that spike demand for air conditioning. This needed evolution in planning has implications for project-level development, as future dams should be planned and designed for the hydrological conditions they are likely to experience, not those of even the recent past. But even more importantly, the planning of infrastructure systems should fully consider a range of alternative solutions to these risks, such as land-use planning and reconnecting floodplains to reduce flood risk and diversifying generation technologies to reduce climate-driven risks to energy. For example, solar panels and wind turbines are generally not vulnerable to floods and solar panels operate near their peak capacity during hot, sunny drought periods when other generation sources are stressed (aside from hydropower dams, nuclear and thermal plants also can see generation curtailed during droughts due to depletion of cooling water sources). The recent disasters in India and Nepal are warnings that climate change will drive considerable increased risk to people and energy infrastructure. But we have a range of solutions for reducing that risk while also restoring and protecting nature.","['india', 'india', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'puertorico', 'colombia', 'laos', 'australia', 'nepal']",us,True,True

Known for its lush landscapes and vibrant wildlife, including jaguars, caimans, macaws and monkeys, the Pantanal is home to the world’s biggest tropical wetlands and, in normal times, a thriving eco-tourism industry. But in recent weeks, it has been ravaged by fires that are threatening its iconic wildlife as Brazil suffers through a Southern Hemisphere spring of droughts and record heat. There were 2,387 fires in the Pantanal in the first 13 days of November, an increase of more than 1,000 percent from the entire month of November last year, according to satellite monitoring by Brazilian space research agency INPE. “The situation is completely out of control. And between the heatwave and the wind, it’s only going to get worse,” says biologist Gustavo Figueiroa, 31, head of the environmental group SOS Pantanal. “The Pantanal is a region that’s used to fires. Normally, it regenerates naturally. But this many fires isn’t normal.” It has been hit hard by drought this year, with normally flooded areas reduced to shrivelled ponds. At one such spot along the dirt highway across the region, the 150km (93-mile) Transpantaneira, a small group of caimans can be seen trying to swim in the shallow water. Nearby, the corpse of another sits rotting on the bank. Elsewhere, a dead porcupine lays on a carpet of ash in the charred remains of what was once a forest. “It probably died of smoke inhalation,” says veterinarian Aracelli Hammann, who is volunteering with a wildlife rescue group. They made the grim find in the Encontro das Aguas park, home to the world’s largest jaguar population. Nearly one-third of the park has been hit by fires in the past month, according to environmental group ICV. Follow Al Jazeera English:","['brazil', 'brazil']",us,False,False

Due to the surge in prices, one-litre bottles of extra-virgin olive oil are now being sold for as much as 14.5 euros ($15.77) in some supermarkets. This has led retailers to place security tags on olive oil bottles, alongside items like spirits, cosmetics, and appliances to prevent shop-lilting and thefts, according to a Reuters report. The price of olive oil has risen by 150% over the past two years, mainly due to a scorching drought in south Europe, which is a major producer. Apart from Spain, other major olive oil producers include Italy, Greece, and Portugal. Households relying on the oil have been feeling the price pinch. Spain is the world's top olive oil producer, supplying about 40% of the world's output. ""We are witnessing a significant increase in shoplifting,"" said Ruben Navarro, CEO of Tu Super, a supermarket chain operating in Spain's Andalucia region told Reuters. ""Olive oil has become an attractive product for thieves to steal."" In an effort to combat theft, Tu Super has resorted to chaining large 5-litre bottles of olive oil together and padlocking them to shelves since September. The outlook for olive oil is also worrisome Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, predicts that olive oil prices in Spain will remain at record levels until at least June due to the consecutive droughts in the southern part of the country. News reports have reported that many Carrefour and Auchan supermarkets in Spain are fitting security tags with one litre bottles of olive oil that require staff intervention for removal. Spanish police have also reported instances of olive oil theft from mills. In Spain, thefts of items worth less than 400 euros are not punished unless it is a repeat offence.

Pathak, 44, migrated from his village in eastern Bihar state over two decades ago to work in the big city on the other side of the country, hoping to supplement his family's income reliant on wheat and rice from their 1.5-acre (0.6-hectare) farm. His decision to leave paid off. Pathak's steady salary from the city job kept his family afloat even as crop yields dropped consistently due to the droughts and floods ravaging his farm. ""It either doesn't rain or it rains so much that it floods. We get just one yield every year. It wasn't like this when I was growing up,"" Pathak told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Now he leases his field to villagers who share half of any profit with him. But he would like to go back to his land if a push towards eco-friendly agriculture helps farmers cope with worsening climate pressures and pays off financially. Agriculture is India's biggest employer, supporting the livelihoods of 250 million farmers and informal labourers - but their work is getting harder as climate change makes living off farming difficult, pushing up debt, migration and suicides. Worries over falling yields have driven up the use of chemical fertilisers that are stripping the soil of nutrients and fuelling agricultural emissions on a warming planet. In response, green farming projects have taken root in India, where staple crops include rice, wheat, maize, sugarcane, cotton and groundnut. But experts say the scale and success hinges on how well the approach protects poor farmers' incomes. ""If you want to sustain agriculture as the biggest employer, and want to bring in sustainable farming, first bring living income to farmers,"" said Devinder Sharma, an independent expert on agricultural policy. ""As a nation, we need to move towards agro-ecology but these (sustainable farming projects) will only bring about cosmetic changes until you provide farmers an assured income,"" he added. A government-backed guaranteed price for natural produce, subsidies to cover losses and stronger marketing channels would all help, he said. A TALE OF TWO FARMERS Worldwide, rice is a staple food for more than 3 billion people while flooded paddy fields account for 12% of humanity's methane emissions - equivalent to 1.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions - according to the Asian Development Bank. Asia-Pacific accounts for the highest emissions from agriculture, partly because of the region's rising use of synthetic fertilisers in rice cultivation, the bank says. Farmers' incomes in India, the second-largest producer of rice globally after China, are wedded to paddy yields. That makes them reluctant to shift away from conventional methods of pumping fertilisers onto fields to raise production. But farmer Jitendra Singh in northern India has made the switch from high fertiliser use, incentivised by the prospect of extra income from generating carbon credits through lower-emitting methods, which can be traded on international markets. He no longer transplants paddy seedlings into flooded fields, but directly sows them into the soil. Besides reducing methane emissions, that has cut water use, time needed for sowing and the use of chemical herbicides and fertilisers. On a rice farm in eastern Odisha state, however, Gurcharan Mahanta seems uninterested in a regional project to promote millet, a long-forgotten crop making a comeback because it is resilient to droughts fuelled by climate change. Mahanta, 54, said his high-yielding hybrid rice variety fetched him a good price, which millet would not with a small consumer base. Growing paddy is also less labour-intensive. ""I go by the market demand,"" he said. FINANCIAL PROBLEMS CURB GREEN SHIFT More than 80% of farmers in India own less than five acres - and many keep spending on fertilisers and pesticides, hoping for good yields even though they face a crushing burden of debt. Nearly 11,000 farmers, cultivators and agricultural labourers took their own lives in 2021, averaging about 30 deaths a day, with bankruptcy the leading cause, according to government data. In a bid to support these smallholders and make farming more climate-friendly, India is promoting organic and natural farming, encouraging diversification to cut dependence on one major crop and incentivising solar-powered water pumps for irrigation to reduce the use of fossil fuel power. At a meeting of G20 agriculture ministers this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the disproportionate impact of climate change on agriculture in the Global South and said Indian farmers are taking up natural farming to revive the soil. ""Our policy is a fusion of back to basics and march to the future. We are promoting natural farming as well as technology-enabled farming,"" he said in a speech. Yet agricultural scientists estimate that fewer than 5% of Indian farmers have switched to sustainable farming methods, even though many are aware of the threat of global warming and the rising costs of conventional practices. ""Farmers understand climate change. They worry about rain and droughts. But they will not understand sustainable agriculture until their problems are first understood,"" said Vikram Singh, joint secretary of the All India Agricultural Workers' Union. TRADITIONAL TIES TO THE LAND Despite the challenges, sustainable farming has brought some success stories, including young people who have given up city careers in tech or pharmaceuticals to return to family farms. But the wins are patchy - and, in some cases, the eco-friendly switch has added to farmers' stress. In the southern Indian state of Telangana, for instance, millers are turning away from genetically modified BT cotton in response to rising global demand for sustainable organic cotton. But organic seeds are rare in India where BT dominates and cotton-processing infrastructure is designed for large volumes. Addressing issues like these - and ensuring that sustainable methods boost crop yields and incomes - will be key to bringing would-be farmers like Pathak back to the land they love. Wrapping up his day driving through the manic Mumbai traffic, Pathak said he pined for the clean air of his village, his jute bed and the farm-fresh gooseberries he enjoys on his annual vacation back home. He hopes to return to that traditional rural life if the economics stack up and local markets for naturally grown produce thrive. He suggested farmers could find other income sources too like selling milk to dairies with village networks, helping them earn between harvests and protecting them from climate extremes. Shiraz Wajih, president of the nonprofit Gorakhpur Environmental Action Group, urged farmers and agricultural scientists to work together to create solutions on the ground. Local production of inputs for natural farming can cut costs and dependence on outside markets while creating jobs, he said. And fine-tuning farm processes suited to each region's ecology would boost acceptance of greener methods, he added. Wajih said most farmers do not want to leave their land, as seen during COVID-19 lockdowns when migrant factory workers returned to their farms to keep them going in tough times. ""People are aware of job options that can pay them better. But land is always the permanent address of farmers,"" he said.

Notwithstanding these commi… [+6219 chars]",Weather,"At therecent G20 summit in New Delhi,world leaders reiterated their commitment to addressing climate change challenges by building sustainable and appropriate solutions. Notwithstanding these commitments, climate-induced loss and damage are taking place in different parts of the world. With an extensive coastline of around 7,517 kilometres, India is among the most vulnerable countries, with exposure to rising sea levels, floods and droughts. The marginalised communities living in the coastal belt are particularly vulnerable to these extreme weather events, which cost the country over 17,000 lives between 2012 and 2021 alone. Extreme climate events have a significant impact on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services as droughts, floods, and cyclones can damage toilets, water supplies, and sewerage infrastructure, affecting the quality of water supply and sewage spillage. This has disastrous health impacts on the communities living in the slum settlements of urban cities. Water was mentioned for the first time in the final declaration adopted at the UN Conference of the Parties (COP27) held at Sharm el-Sheikh in November 2022. Building on the resolutions and commitments made at COP27, countries have to make serious efforts to find effective solutions to address the climate impact on WASH at the forthcoming COP28 in Dubai. The responsibility for providing drinking water supply and sanitation services falls under the purview of state governments, as outlined in the State List of the Seventh Schedule. The 74th Amendment to the Constitution mandated the devolution of these services to the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). Despite India having the policy framework for WASH-related policies in flagship missions such as the Swachh Bharat and Jal Jeevan missions, the country still struggles with developing a climate-resilient WASH infrastructure and sustainable practices. Understanding and improving resilience requires reliable data that offers insights into urban dynamics and the potential challenges faced by the poor living in these settlements. In this context, the risk and vulnerability assessment that the Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) did, supported by the Water for Women initiative of the Australian government, to identify the potential climatic risks and their impact on WASH infrastructure in the slum areas of Jaipur and Bhubaneswar, provides important insights. For this, we selected households in 19 wards and 24 wards in Bhubaneswar and Jaipur respectively. As the spatial locations of slums play a significant role in designing appropriate local actions for the resilience of the marginalised groups, we selected slum settlements which are susceptible to climate change impacts. For example, in Bhubaneswar, 48.6 per cent of settlements were situated near drains and canal roads, exposing them to potential flooding during heavy rains. The consequences are evident when considering the 2011 Census data for a total of 67 wards in Bhubaneswar and 77 wards in Jaipur; it reveals that 52 per cent and 16 per cent of the wards, respectively, face high vulnerability due to multiple indicators, including illiteracy, lack of access to electricity and mobile phones, and the significant presence of marginalised communities, particularly Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. These factors, when combined with the three critical WASH indicators (lack of latrine facilities, wastewater treatment and access to treated drinking water), compound the vulnerabilities and significantly impact the overall resilience of these populations. The pressing question is whether programmes like the Swachh Bharat Mission and AMRUT scheme, which have diligently worked to improve WASH infrastructure in informal settlements, have adequately addressed climate preparedness on both small and large scales. Our study emphasises the consequences of climate events on water and sanitation services. While tap connections have improved to 92 per cent in Bhubaneswar and 72 per cent in Jaipur, these figures drop, respectively, to 77 per cent and 25 per cent during adverse climate events, forcing people to resort to government and private tankers. Similarly, access to latrine facilities declined during these events, leading to a surge in open defecation, from 6 per cent to 18 per cent in Bhubaneswar and 11 per cent to 80 per cent in Jaipur. People are aware of the need for raised pit latrines in flood-prone areas, but financial constraints and the low-lying location of households hinder their construction. Additionally, while public/mobile toilets have increased to 11 per cent in Bhubaneswar and 6.4 per cent in Jaipur, they are often submerged and unclean after heavy rains, emphasising the need for climate-resilient WASH infrastructure and community preparedness; this is particularly vital due to the high prevalence of vector- and water-borne diseases. Therefore, the spread of diseases adds another layer of challenges, with 80 per cent of slum residents in Bhubaneswar and 63 per cent in Jaipur reporting fever, skin infections, malaria, dengue and typhoid, loss of livelihood, with economic instability and increased healthcare costs. Women and girls suffered the most, grappling with menstrual hygiene challenges and facing harassment while relieving themselves due to the lack of home toilets. Despite facing a series of challenges, the silver lining is that the people are adaptive and not ready to give up. People across slums and wards continuously find and experiment with ways to address these challenges. To combat the spread of waterborne diseases, they regularly test water quality in various wards, such as 16, 18, 30, and 49 in Bhubaneswar, and 7, 84, 93, and 99 in Jaipur; they also monitor places prone to waterlogging independently. Moreover, they take it upon themselves to get defunct water sources, like hand-pumps, repaired and have prepared alternative water sources in wards such as 5, 18, 19, and 46 in Bhubaneswar and ward 84 and 99 in Jaipur. Governments can further strengthen people’s initiatives by strengthening their capacity to sustain safe sanitation and incentivising them to revive alternative water sources, store water to cope with supply irregularities, and conduct regular water testing for a resilient and sustainable future.

As districts in eastern Rajasthan reel from water scarcity for both household and irrigation purposes, the Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project ( ERCP ) to divert surplus monsoon water from the Chambal basin has gained political currency. The project has been mired in political wrangling for years. While the Congress has accused the Centre of deliberately not allowing national status to the ERCP, the BJP alleged that the ruling party in the state is doing politics instead of taking constructive steps for implementing the scheme. The ERCP was originally proposed by the previous BJP dispensation as a permanent solution to the irrigation and drinking water problems of residents in the region's 13 districts. The Congress has raised the pitch for national status to the ERCP in a bid to woo voters in the 83 assembly seats in the region. Setting the tone, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot launched a ""yatra against the betrayal of the Centre over the ERCP"" in October from Baran and covering other eastern districts. #Elections With Assembly Election News All Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan Telangana Chhattisgarh Mizoram UP: Preparations underway in Mathura ahead of PM Modi's visit on Nov 23 Rajasthan: It's polling time, parties compete to offer freebies In Amer, BJP's Satish Poonia banks on local gatherings Battle for Jat crown in Rajasthan seat: Laxmangarh Since the formation of the Congress government in Rajasthan in 2018, Gehlot has been trying to corner the BJP-led Centre, demanding national status for the ERCP. Of the 83 assembly seats in the region's 13 districts, the Congress had bagged 49 while the BJP won 25 in the 2018 elections. Independent candidates won eight seats while the Rashtriya Lok Dal secured victory in the other. ""I will vote for the person who can solve our water issue but they do nothing once they win,"" says Usha, who lives with her parents and works as a house help. Residents in even posh areas complained of water shortage, with some claiming they get a supply every three days. ""We are dependent on tankers. I have friends in Scheme 8 who are unable to go out anywhere in the evenings because they get the water supply for just 15 minutes every couple of days. Things are bad in every area,"" says Geet, a resident of Manu Marg. Congress candidate from Alwar (rural) Tikaram Jully, who was also a cabinet minister in the Ashok Gehlot government, said that the water crisis in the area was a key issue and he has promised the citizens that he would bring water supply via ERCP to Alwar. ""I am mainly focusing on the issue of water here. This problem persists in all villages. ""As an MLA, I had set up tube wells in several villages earlier and even approved several schemes to provide them relief. However, due to lack of groundwater, the schemes aren't working well. We even brought a scheme a few years ago through which we sanctioned Chambal's water here but then the pandemic happened,"" Jully told PTI. ""I even got my constituency added in the ERCP and have promised the citizens that I would bring water to Alwar via that project,"" he added. Jully said that the project could have been ""easily implemented"" as Rajasthan has BJP MPs in Lok Sabha from all 25 seats and accused the Centre of ""deliberately halting it"". Refuting his statement, BJP candidate from Alwar (rural) Jairam Jatav said that the Centre ""never refused to provide funds"" for the ERCP. Jatav said that if voted to power, the BJP would take up the matter in the first session of the state assembly. ""Ashok Gehlot said that PM Modi is not issuing funds for the project, whereas the Centre has never refused any funds. ""If a state government seeks funds for an important project, why will the Centre neglect it? Be it Rajasthan or any other state, it is the central government that issues funds. If voted to power, we will take it up in the first assembly session,"" Jatav told PTI. Ashok Verma, who hails from Parsa Ka Bas village and is a BJP member, said the drinking water problem is mostly in urban areas while the rural areas are not getting water for irrigation due to a drop in the water table. ""The state government could have worked on alternative local projects like diverting water from Siliserh Lake but instead of doing that they are making noise to divert attention from issues of illegal mining and rampant land grabbing in Alwar,"" he alleged. The Congress candidate, however, said the prime minister had announced in Jaipur and Ajmer that ERCP would be implemented ""but nothing happened"". ""Rajasthan has given 25 MPs in Lok Sabha yet they did not do anything about the ERCP. ""Congress will complete the project in the next two to three years if voted to power,"" he said. The project, which is estimated to cost more than Rs 40,000 crore, will help augment irrigation facilities on 2 lakh hectares in the 13 districts. Eastern Rajasthan covers Jhalawar, Baran, Kota, Bundi, Sawai Madhopur, Ajmer, Tonk, Ajmer, Dausa, Karauli, Alwar, Bharatpur and the Dholpur districts. The Congress is also targeting the sitting BJP MP, who is now a candidate from Tijara assembly constituency Baba Balaknath, on the ERCP issue. ""People of Tijara should give him a befitting reply and ask what he has done as an MP from Alwar. Has he ever reminded the Centre about the ERCP project that is important for Alwar? He hasn't done anything for the people here and hence, he is bringing a communal angle to this election fight now,"" general secretary and media in-charge of Rajasthan Congress Swadim Chaturvedi said. Minister of State for Jal Shakti Bishweswar Tudu had, in a written reply in Rajya Sabha, said that a detailed project report (DPR) of the ERCP was submitted by the state government to the Central Water Commission in November 2017. ""However, appraisal of the project could not move further as the project is planned on 50 per cent dependable yield against the established norm of 75 per cent dependability. Thus, the ERCP does not fulfil the criteria laid down for inclusion under the National Projects scheme of this Ministry,"" the reply said. However, the Special Committee for Interlinking of Rivers has in December 2022 approved the proposal of considering the modified Parbati-Kalisindh-Chambal (PKC) link project integrated with ERCP, as a part of the National Perspective Plan, and declared the phase-I of the project as a priority interlinking project, it said. Assembly polls in Rajasthan will be held on November 25 while the votes will be counted on December 3.

It spews water so fresh that people here call it nectar. Workers inside a small plant ferry sleek glass bottles along a conveyer. The bottles, filled with a whoosh of this natural mineral water, are labeled, packed into cases and placed inside a truck for a long ride. Ganesh Iyer, who heads the operation, watches like a nervous dad, later pulling out his phone, as any proud parent might, to show the underground cavern the waters have formed in this pristine kingdom, the world’s last Shangri-La. This is no ordinary water. It will travel hundreds of miles to some of India’s luxury hotels, restaurants and richest families, who pay about $6 per bottle, roughly a day’s wage for an Indian laborer. Millions of people worldwide don’t have clean water to drink, even though the United Nations deemed water a basic human right more than a decade ago. Yet, even as extreme heat dries up more aquifers and wells and leaves more people thirsty, luxury water has become fashionable among the world’s privileged, who uncap and taste it like fine wine. This “fine water"" is drawn from volcanic rock in Hawaii, from icebergs that have fallen from melting glaciers in Norway, or from droplets of morning mist in Tasmania. Connoisseurs, some who study to become water sommeliers, insist this trend isn’t about snobbishness. They appreciate the purest of the pure. “Water is not just water,” says Michael Mascha, a founder of the Fine Water Society, a consortium of small bottlers and distributors worldwide. He likens consumers of high-end water tofoodies who’d drive miles to find heirloom tomatoes or a rare salt. Some drink fine water instead of alcohol. “Having the right stemware, drinking at the right temperature, pairing it with food, celebrating with water – all those kinds of things are important.” ___ As a truck rolls out of the Bhutanese bottling plant, operated by Veen Waters India, the 40-some line workers take a tea break along a short row of employee housing. They check their mobile phones and chat, while birds chirp in the background. Laundry hung out to dry flaps in a subtle breeze. It’s a steamy day, even at this higher elevation. Up a hillside behind them is a mineral spring, once a source of fresh water for nearby villagers, who used bamboo rods as pipes to help funnel some of the steadily flowing clear current into buckets they carried home. Now that source, which Veen purchased from the previous owner more than a decade ago, is kept behind a locked gate for safekeeping. Veen’s business slowed to a trickle during the pandemic, says Iyer, Veen’s managing partner. But now the company is exporting about 20,000 cases — or 240,000 bottles — of the water into India each month, minus the occasional few that break on their bumpy multiple-day trek. He figures they’ve tapped only about 10% of the potential market so far. After crossing into India, the trucks carrying the bottled water run through lush green Darjeeling tea plantations, past road signs marking elephant crossings and the occasional cluster of teenage boys cooling off in a rain catchment next to rural villages dotted with banana trees. Eventually, the cases are delivered to luxury hotels and restaurants many hundreds of miles away in cities like New Delhi, Pune and Mumbai, where Veen is headquartered. A few wealthy families get weekly shipments. Iyer jokes that the richest of the rich buy so much that they “probably bathe in it.” Market reports predict even greater demand for premium water worldwide in years to come. In India — now the most populous country in the world, with a rising standard of living and growing concerns about water quality — Veen is poised to help satisfy that demand. For many Indians, however, the story of water is very different, including in Mumbai’s Dharavi neighborhood, one of Asia's largest slums, jammed with working families. There, water arrives in municipal pipelines just once a day, from about 6 to 9 a.m., setting off a flurry of activity as the day’s crushing heat arrives in spring and summer. The three-hour window for water shapes the neighborhood's rituals. Men in shorts or underwear lather up in a bath area. Their upbeat banter is constant as they prepare for the day. Residents of this labyrinth of narrow alleyways and small homes brush their teeth while standing on front porches, spitting toothpaste into water that runs along the uneven blocks of concrete on the ground. They fill up buckets and reclaimed bottles to keep water at home. A few women wash aluminum pots and pans or briskly scrub T-shirts, scarves and other clothing. Still others are more desperate, such as Rekha Nagesh Pawar, who lives with her four children in a tent made out of blue plastic tarps along a busy Mumbai roadway. The water she gets from a neighbor, when he’s feeling charitable, has been siphoned illegally from a public system with a garden hose. She says her husband, a mason, died from a heart attack in 2021, leaving her to beg for money for food. She frets that there’s often not enough water to bathe her children or wash their clothes. “We have to live in filth,” the weary-eyed woman says. It’s hard for her to fathom that someone would pay a day's wages for a bottle of fancy water. ___ Veen is far from the most expensive in the fine water category. The rarest of all, often bottled in collectable glass, sell for hundreds of dollars apiece. This scene was on full display when members of the Fine Water Society gathered in April at a swanky hotel in Athens, Greece, for their annual international tasting competition and symposium. With bottles and glasses lined up before them, judges from several countries sampled various brands, swishing gulps of water and sometimes spitting mouthfuls into canisters, as wine tasters do. Spectators seated before them watched intently. Many were bottlers who’d come to compete. The judges flipped cards to indicate their scores for each entrant: 92, 98, and so on. “Who wins here? It’s really sometimes very hard to predict,” says Mascha, who served as a judge. “There’s always a sleeper.” Twenty years ago, people mocked his fascination with water, which grew from his doctor’s insistence that he quit drinking alcohol. He searched for alternatives that might enrapture him the same way a complex bottle of cabernet once had. As he tried more waters from small batch bottlers, he discovered like-minded water devotees. That group has only grown. They discuss “virginality,” or purity. They learn about “terroir,” the environment in which water originates. They compare the total dissolved solids, or TDS. Waters with low TDS are more like rainwater that hasn’t touched the earth. Those with high TDS — such as Vichy mineral water from thermal springs in France and Catalan — have robust mineral content that may include calcium, magnesium, potassium or sodium, among others. A few restaurants in countries such as Spain and the United States now have menus that pair food with particular types of fine water. A bolder mineral water, for instance, might be suggested as a companion for a charbroiled steak. More subtle rainwater might be paired with fish. This year’s champions in each category, from still water to sparkling and super-low minerality to high, came from Austria, New Zealand, Panama, Scandinavia and other parts of the world. Awards, however, do not guarantee success in what can be a very competitive business, especially for the mom-and-pop bottlers. “Every brand has to find its unique selling point,” says Jamal Qureshi, founder of the now-defunct Svalbardi Polar Iceberg Water, based on the far-north Norwegian island of Svalbard. “If it’s just like, ‘Oh, you know, we’re a special water from wherever,’ it’s hard to stand out.” His company, once a rising star in the fine water scene and winner of awards, sold melted Arctic icebergs, bottled in fancy glass containers, online. The idea was to harvest small floating remnants of glaciers to tell the story of climate change, the proliferation of greenhouse gases and its direct impact on the disappearing Arctic landscape. People paid $100 (US) for a bottle of Svalbardi. Often, the company sold out. Then in late 2020, a shipment of 15,000 empty bottles from a supplier arrived broken and scratched, forcing the fledgling company to close down. Without its opulent packaging, the average consumer might fail to taste the difference in these waters. Even sommeliers say it can take months of practice to determine the subtleties. “Please smell my water and tell me how good or bad it is,” people sometimes tease Iyer, of Veen, when they learn he’s a certified water sommelier — India’s first, he says. He takes no offense. But Mascha, of the Fine Water Society, is quick to differentiate fine water from “mega-corporations that exploit water.” Water sold in clear plastic bottles that are ubiquitous the world over is often simply filtered municipal water that’s distilled and bottled from any number of sources. In many instances, Mascha says, a water filter on your tap would produce the same result, with far less impact on the environment. When it comes to fine water, he says natural spring water, for instance, must come from a single source and be bottled near that source. He calls the bottlers in his society small “water farmers.” ___ Solutions to the world’s water problems won’t come easily. That is the reality of life in water-stressed countries like India, a country that has 18% of the world’s population, but only 4% of its water, according to the World Bank. Water shortages have sparked protests and conflict. Last year, a man was stabbed and killed in a fight over water in the town of Aurangabad, north of Mumbai. The Indian government has promised that every household will soon have plumbing and running water — a goal set for this year that has yet to be reached. “But just because we spend money and put the pipes in, doesn’t mean that people will actually have water in their taps,” says Veena Srinivasan, executive director of WELL Labs, a research institution in Bengaluru, India, that studies water sustainability. Climate change has only worsened droughts and heatwaves and put more pressure on India's underground aquifers, as well as rivers that also are polluted by industry, farming and sewage. India is among many countries that have built huge plants to desalinate sea water. Others, including Singapore, are collecting and cleaning up storm and wastewater to try to solve their water woes. But solutions like those are in their infancy in many countries, if they exist at all. That means the commodification of water, and those who profit from it, are likely to become more contentious. Fine water is certainly a commodity too, though its connoisseurs and those who bottle often speak of the importance of respecting and conserving an increasingly precious resource. Even for them, luxury water is often just that – a luxury. Iyer only drinks Veen when out at a restaurant. At home, he and his wife consume tap water after boiling it. As many do, he likes to store it in a matka, an Indian red clay pot that is a water cooler. He also still bathes with a bucket, while sitting on a stool, a common Indian custom that also saves water. “On one hand, we consider water to be holy and divine,” Iyer says. “But we take it for granted. We believe water will always be there.” ___ In Bhutan, Buddhist prayer flags are a common sight -- squares of five colors, strung along bridges and at meditation stops next to scenic mountain roadways. Blue represents space. Red is for fire; yellow is earth; white is air. Green symbolizes water, a revered resource in a country known for its environmental stewardship. It is a common custom to place the purest spring water in bowls as a sacred offering in a home or a temple. Water also has economic benefits for the kingdom, where an abundance of rivers and a small population of about 700,000 mean there is a surplus of hydroelectricity to export, much of it to neighboring India. Here, water is both pure, and powerful. Tshering Bumpa, the longtime manager of the Veen bottling facility, understands the significance. “We are so proud of our water,” says Bumpa, who has dressed in colorful Bhutanese traditional garments to welcome rare visitors to this remote spot in the jungle. There is enough water to share. At least for now. ___ AP’s Theodora Tongas in Athens, Greece; Rajanish Kakade in Mumbai, India; and Sheikh Saaliq in New Delhi contributed to this report. ___ Martha Irvine, an AP national writer and visual journalist, can be reached at mirvine@ap.org or at http://twitter.com/irvineap","['bhutan', 'bhutan', 'bhutan', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'norway', 'australia', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'france', 'mexico', 'spain', 'austria', 'newzealand', 'panama', 'us', 'singapore', 'china', 'china', 'not found']",us,True,False

The only possible difference was that the chicks had been exposed to unidentified microbes on their journey from the hatchery in the Spanish region of Catalonia, according to Gilbert, a geneticist at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.The microbes that the chicks ingested would have been part of the vast array of microorganisms—including bacteria, fungi and viruses—that exist in the environment, people and animals and that are collectively called the microbiome.""This gave us an extremely interesting insight into how very small differences in the microbiome in the early stages of life can have big knock-on effects on an animal's development and big consequences for farming,"" Gilbert said.The research carried out by his team was part of a project that received EU funding to investigate the impact of feed and supplements on the microbiome and, ultimately, the health of chickens and salmon.CalledHoloFood, the project ended in April 2023 after almost four and a half years.How animals' genetics and their microbiome interact is a rapidly growing area of research known as hologenomics. The word comes from the term ""holobiont,"" which describes ahost speciesand the collection of microbes and other species living in or around it in a mini ecosystem.Microbes present in the environment colonize the gut of an animal as soon as it is born, creating a community teeming with trillions of both beneficial and potentially harmful bacteria, viruses and fungi.The microbiome of a person or an animal has a big influence on health, affecting growth and immune responses and regulating nutrient intake. It is even thought to affecthuman behavior, including social interaction. Meanwhile, microbes in plants and soil affect crop growth and resilience.Greener gutsFinding ways to optimize the microbiome could be one route to ensuring healthier food for a growing global population.It could also ease the environmental impact of farming by reducing the need for fertilizers, antibiotics and other chemicals.Research in this area is part of Europe'sFood 2030initiative, which aims to spur a transition towards greener, healthier and more accessible diets.The science of exactly how microbes could be harnessed to enhance the health, productivity and quality of agricultural production is still in the early stages.Helped by advances in DNA sequencing that shed greater light on microbial communities, HoloFood laid the ground for a better understanding of the impact of food substances and supplements on the microbiome and—ultimately—on animal health.This type of research could eventually aid the development of sustainable food production.In trials, fish fed on seaweed and mussels—more sustainable additives and protein alternatives to traditional feed—turned out to be just as healthy and grew just as well.""That's actually a big win because it means you can replace foodstuffs like imported soy,"" Gilbert said.Homegrown answersAnother EU-funded project,SIMBA, produced some similar findings during its five-year run until the end of October 2023.The researchers found that part of traditional soy-based fish feed can be replaced with a mix of more sustainable, locally sourced rapeseed meal and seaweed with no negative effect on the gut microbiome.This offers the promise of developing aquaculture sources in the EU rather than importing large amounts of soy from the Americas, according to Dr. Anne Pihlanto, a food and bioproducts researcher at the Natural Resources Institute Finland in Helsinki.""The fish grew well with the alternative feed, suggesting that some of the soy can be replaced with materials that are available here in Europe,"" said Pihlanto, who led SIMBA.Understandingmicrobial communitiescould help make other forms of food production—such as the cultivation of crops—more sustainable too.The researchers investigated how microbes affect growth and resistance to certain diseases or environmental conditions like drought. The repercussions are potentially enormous.""If we can find the right microbes, they could help at least partly replace fertilizers, improving resilience in the food system,"" said Pihlanto.Plant resilienceThe researchers found that inoculating Arabidopsis plants—often used as model organisms—with a mix of four particular microbe speciesresulted in increased drought tolerance. This hints at a potential to improve resistance in other crops too.They identified further microbial mixes that aided the growth of wheat—perhaps through enhancing the uptake of nitrogen—and that improved the yield of potatoes grown in salt marshes.The implications for harnessing seawater for irrigation in areas of the world unsuitable for cultivation are potentially significant.Projects like HoloFood and SIMBA have opened up the field for future research into how microbes can make food production healthier and better for the planet.The knowledge generated by both projects is available on theHoloFood Data Portaland the SIMBAopen-access database, adding to information about the microbiome also emerging from other EU-funded research initiatives including3D-omicsandFindingPheno.""I hope knowledge will keep improving so we know what kinds of microbes we should use in different places,"" said Pihlanto.

Despite the benefits such as disease resistance, drought tolerance, and improved fruit quality, the environmental factors still predominantly dictate grapevine traits.Wood anatomy and hydraulic conductivity are significantly influenced by grafting, with implications for drought resistance and overall plant health. However, the complexity of interactions between grafted components and their environment is not fully understood. The precise role of grafting in shaping wood anatomy and its subsequent impact on vine physiology and productivity, particularly howrootstock-scion compatibility and alignment affect secondary growth, represents a critical area for future research.In October 2022,Horticulture Researchpublished a perspective titled ""X-ray imaging of 30 year old wine grape wood reveals cumulative impacts of rootstocks on scion secondary growth and Ravaz index.""In this study, X-ray computed tomography was employed to investigate how 15 different rootstocks affect the secondary growth of 30-year-old Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon grapevines.First, researchers applied a model that incorporated scion and rootstock variables to predict the scion trunk radius. This model revealed that scion accounted for 46.53% of the variation, rootstock for 16.57%, and their interaction for just 2.42%. Additionally, within the same scion type, rootstock significantly altered the scion trunk radius range, with a notable 143% and 129% difference between the widest and narrowest trunk radii conferred by specific rootstocks in Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon respectively.In addition, the study utilized a negative exponential model to explore how scion and rootstock influence ring width across the scion trunk. Changes in the model parameters (A, B, and k) indicated that A influenced overall ring width, B the early rings' width, and k the rate at which ring width approached the asymptote.Notably, Cabernet Sauvignon consistently had wider ring widths compared to Chardonnay. The significance of the scion and rootstock on these parameters varied, with rootstock showing a significant effect on the decay parameter k, explaining 22.68% of the variation. The study correlated various traits with ring features, using a large dataset that spanned different years.The Ravaz index and juice pH were found to be robustly correlated with ring and trunk widths. The Ravaz index, in particular, was negatively correlated with scion trunk radius, suggesting that larger trunks correspond to lower yields relative to pruning weight.Finally, the study measured physiological traits, including assimilation rate, transpiration rate, and water use efficiency (WUEi), across different rootstocks to determine the effect of scion trunk radius on vine physiology. The findings suggested that vines with wider trunks had higher rates of assimilation and transpiration but decreased water use efficiency. Leaf temperature, however, did not show a significant correlation with scion trunk radius.In conclusion, this study demonstrates that rootstocks play a critical role in the vine's adaptation to genetic andenvironmental factors. The ability to modulate vegetative growth and yield through rootstock choice holds the potential for advancing grape cultivation, informing vineyard management practices, and optimizing fruit and wine quality in woody perennial crop species.",[],gb,False,False

Studies also suggests that women are more affected by climate anxiety than men. The rise of wildfires, floods and droughts around the world are just some of the highly visible signs of climate change. What is reported less is the impact of climate change on human minds. Climate anxiety - defined as feelings of distress about the impacts of climate change - has been reported globally, particularly among children and young people. Data from Google Trends shows that search queries related to ""climate anxiety"" have increased dramatically. Search queries in English around ""climate anxiety"" in the first 10 months of 2023 are 27 times higher than the same period in 2017. There have been surges related to climate anxiety in other world languages over the same period. These are not the languages with the most commonly searched queries around climate anxiety but are just some of the world languages the BBC asked Google to look at. Searches may be higher among speakers of languages with greater awareness of climate anxiety, or among those who use Google most often and do not necessarily suggest that people in countries with bigger shares of search queries are more prone to experiencing climate anxiety. The Google Trends data combines search queries for ""climate anxiety"" and ""eco-anxiety"", terms which are often used in the same way but which have slightly different meanings. Climate anxiety is anxiety specifically associated with awareness of climate change. Eco-anxiety is a more general anxiety associated with awareness of threats to environmental health, including pollution and loss of biodiversity. Google Trends does not simply measure the total volume of searches but looks at a sample of searches to identify trends around the world. It uses a measure called ""search interest"", to look at the relative popularity of search queries over time. Nordic countries had the biggest share of global search queries related to climate anxiety over the past five years. In fact, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway accounted for more than 40% of search queries related to ""climate anxiety"". Google says that its data is adjusted to account for differences in overall search volume, which allows it to compare countries of various population sizes. That's why smaller countries may top the ranking instead of more populated ones. Countries in the Global South - such as Chile, the Philippines and South Africa - represented smaller shares of search queries. Countries with low search volumes have been excluded from the analysis. Google says it has also noted a global increase in search queries about the future of the planet together with queries about the environment in the last 12 months. ""When you look at the kind of queries people are searching for, it's evident that they are seeking understanding, but also wanting to take action,"" a spokesperson said. ""For example, 'how to solve climate change' was one of the trending queries about climate change worldwide in the last two years."" Google data shows a rise in queries about the future together with climate change (up 120%), adaptation (up 120%), sustainability (up 40%) and greenhouse gas emissions (up 120%) in the last 12 months. Trending queries worldwide about climate change include Spanish language searches such as ""cuales son los riesgos del cambio climático?"" or ""what are the risks of climate change?"" (up 150%). Google did not release data on the gender of people searching for queries related to ""climate anxiety"" but research has indicated that women are more predisposed to climate anxiety than men. Findings from a 2023 study published in the academic journal Sustainability, for example, showed that female respondents around the world reported ""greater levels of concern and negative emotions"" about climate change. Male respondents, on the other hand, were ""more optimistic and expressed greater faith in government"". The study was based on an online survey of 10,000 people aged 16 to 25 across 10 countries carried out in 2021. Analysis of more than 44,000 respondents from the European Social Survey in 2019 also concluded that women registered greater concern about climate change than men. Professor Susan Clayton, who co-authored the Sustainability study, has some possible explanations for this. She says that one reason women consistently report higher levels of concern is that they are more open to discussing emotions. ""Women are in general more willing, and may be able to acknowledge their own emotional response [to climate change]. So they seem to think about their emotions, and they are more willing to talk about them, compared to men in general,"" she says. But she also says that some women may worry more about climate change because they are at greater risk than men of experiencing some of the real-life impacts. ""After an extreme weather event you frequently find increased levels of domestic violence, and when people are involuntarily displaced, due to climate change, that opens women to the threat of sexual violence or trafficking,"" she says. ""Also, women are often physiologically vulnerable to climate change. So high temperatures and air pollution can have an impact during pregnancy and the ways pregnancy affects a woman's body may make it more difficult for her to escape extreme climate conditions."" There is some research which suggests women are more likely than men to die in climate change-related disasters. For example, a study looking at cyclones in Bangladesh between 1983 and 2009 suggested that women had an increased mortality risk compared to the general adult population. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says it's likely that humans have contributed to the increased intensity of some cyclones. Professor Clayton says that gender-based inequalities mean that some women in poorer countries may lack access to information following a climate change event. They are less likely to be able to travel to a place of safety, and may have caring responsibilities that mean they prioritise the safety of others over themselves. Indirect and longer-term impacts of climate change can also be detrimental to the wellbeing of women and girls. ""Some studies have shown that girls are married earlier when the family is facing economic pressures associated with the changing conditions of climate change. ""For example, maybe agriculture is threatened by droughts or floods and so because of their economic constraints families want to marry off their daughters, so they don't have to feed the daughters themselves,"" Professor Clayton adds. In 2022, the IPCC reported on the mental health impacts of climate change for the first time. This year's COP28 in Dubai will also feature several discussions about mental health. Just as the physical impacts of climate change are on the rise, so too is the attention paid to its impacts on the mind.

At a camp for internally displaced people on the outskirts of Baidoa city in southwest Somalia, Halima Abdi, 57, walks through the flooded compound to access her makeshift house. It is partly submerged in the water, which had forced her to leave the previous day. Most of her neighbours have left to seek shelter in Baidoa and, as she stands in the almost-empty camp of scattered shanty houses, she checks to see what is left after the flood swept away her belongings. “We were forced to flee after three days of heavy rain that almost took our lives,” Abdi, a single mother of seven children told Al Jazeera. “We are left with nothing but just the pillars of the house, and the floods swept away all our goods including the utensils, mattress and clothes. I have rescued my children and taken them to a different house in the town.” Early last year, Abdi sought refuge at the camp to get aid after a severe drought destroyed their maize farm in Manaas village, about 45km (28 miles) south of Baidoa and could barely get anything to feed her children. It was the worst drought the Horn of Africa had experienced in four decades. Since then, she has been dependent on aid in the form of food and medicine to survive. Today, her fortunes have been dampened again. “We couldn’t plant anything due to the failed rainfall in four consecutive seasons and that is why we come to the camp looking for a better life. Now it has rained heavily and my makeshift house isn’t there any more and I literally have to swim back when accessing the main road,” she added. Climate change has upended lives and livelihoods across the region in the last two years. The United Nations has said 4.3 million people, a quarter of Somalia’s population, are at risk of “crisis-level hunger or worse” this year due to drought and floods. Kevin Mackey, Somalia country director of the NGO World Vision, has said children are among the most affected groups and are now “at increased risk of illness”. With these floods following right after the dry spell, the most vulnerable people in Somalia have been hit once again by the latest shocks in a continuing climate crisis. In Dolow town, approximately 250km (155 miles) from where Abdi lives, Heyba Shirar and her four children live in her relative’s house with nowhere else to go. “I have nothing to feed my children with, I used to run a small restaurant but it’s no longer operational due to the floods and the cost of living is very high since the roads are impassable.” Shirar, 28, told Al Jazeera. “No clean water to drink and all the water storage is destroyed. Also, all the sewage system is ruined and the number of people falling sick is increasing. I also got sick and I was diagnosed with malaria, we are suffering, we kindly ask for help.” Many Somalis attribute floods and drought to God’s action but analysts have said the unusually heavy rains were triggered by the El Nino phenomenon, the periodic warming of surface waters in the Pacific. According to the country’s disaster management agency SoDMA, the torrential rains have affected nearly 1.5 million people in South-Central and caused the death of at least50 people. Its data shows that 687,235 people in the Gedo, Hiraan, Bay and Bakool regions were forced to flee their houses, as floodwaters swept away key bridges and destroyed up to 6,000 houses. More rain is forecast between November 21-24 and is expected to cause more destruction. The government says it has made efforts to address the current crisis and delivered humanitarian aid to some affected areas. Somali government spokesperson Farhan Mohamed Jimale told Al Jazeera that food aid, mosquito nets and other relief materials have been delivered to 4,500 families displaced by the rains. “We have also initiated lifesaving programmes which includes deployment of dozens of boats where bridges are destroyed,” he said, adding that there are ongoing partnerships with aid organisations who are also responding as the situation unfolds. However, the effects of the climate crisis remain widespread across Somalia. In Beledweyne, an agricultural town about 350km (217 miles) northwest of the capital Mogadishu, the downpour ruined countless hectares of farmlands, some of which are still flooded. The flash floods from the river also displaced thousands of families who are now surviving on anything they can find. “The water level is reaching my chest and all over the residential [area] is flooded and inaccessible. I was forced to flee with my children and took them to higher ground. Literally, my children are sleeping on the ground [during] this cold and raining period.” Abdikadir Abdullahi Mohamed, 60, a father of three in Beledeweyne told Al Jazeera. “I had a grocery store and a farm and all was swept away by the floods,” he added. “I have lost about $2,000 and still continue to count the loss; we are suffering. It’s just now that we were hoping to plant and harvest given the drought over the years but it’s over.” According to the United Nations, countries like Somalia – which contributes 0.03 percent of total global emissions – are being disproportionately affected by climate change. It is a topic that was debated at the Africa Climate Summit in Kenya in September and is expected to again be discussed as world leaders gather in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for COP28, the UN Climate Change Conference, from November 30 – December 12. Meanwhile, the Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) – a body tasked with climate forecasts – of the regional bloc IGAD has warned that the effects of climate change are becoming more severe, frequent and widespread with far-reaching consequences for the region. The centre says the region lacks an active multi-stakeholder coordination mechanism for the preparation of resources based on climate data and tools for early warning, alerts and disaster triggers. “At an average global warming level of above 1.1 degree Celsius – and the region warms faster than this average – more climate change impacts are likely,” Guleid Artan, the director at ICPAC told Al Jazeera. Artan added that for resilience during recurrent and severe climate-related hazards, people need early warning information from real-time monitoring by government agencies. That is missing and could take time to put into place. “There is [the] need to build back better and not resettle people in lowlands and flood-prone areas,” he said. “An integrated approach on land and environmental restoration and rehabilitating degraded landscapes including tree planting will help to reduce disasters in the medium and long run.” For now, Abdi, despite the situation around her, is still hopeful. “There is nothing we can do, I hope and pray that we overcome this, return to our farming activities and recover from the disaster,” she said.

[+] to come? For Americans across the globe, Thanksgiving is synonymous with turkey dinners, family gatherings, and a celebration of harvest and gratitude. While most families give plenty of thought to the size, temperature, and fixings surrounding the turkey platter on Thanksgiving, few consider the ecological toll it took to get it there. So this Thanksgiving, it might be worthwhile to carve out a moment to ponder the ecological footprint of bringing the turkey from farm to your table. Most turkeys in the United States are reared on factory farms where they live on a diet of crops grown specifically to feed animals. As much as 50% of a large poultry bird’s feed in the United States consists of corn. With rising temperatures impacting corn production and concerns about the land needed to meet the demands for feed-crop production, it’s unclear whether American households will have turkey in a few decades time. How Climate Affects Corn Production If global warming were to exceed 2 degrees Celsius, corn production in the central belt of the United States, where it is predominantly grown, can be adversely affected, say scientists. NASA reports that average global crop yields for corn may decrease by a quarter by late century if current climate change trends continue. There are also studies showing that today’s corn belt could become unsuitable for production, driven by climate impacts such as droughts. For instance, the Midwest drought in 2012 drove up the price of corn to almost $8 per bushel, three times the usual price. As feed supply shortages increase with rising temperatures, the upward trend in the price can be expected to stay. A recent study shows that the livestock industry could face operating losses to the tune of $24.7 billion by 2030 mainly due to climate-change impacts on feed. Decrease in maize yields at end of the century The Trade-Off Between Using Land For Feed Crop Versus Directly For Food It's not just the decrease in corn yields that is of concern. Many question whether U.S. land used for corn production is the best use of that land and if it would be better allocated for other food production. More than half of the almost 300 million hectares of U.S. farm land is used for corn and soymeal production. The actual farmed area used to produce food for human consumption is much smaller—about the size of Indiana, Illinois and half of Iowa combined. If the land currently used to feed livestock were used to grow food directly for human consumption—such as vegetables—it could increase available food calories by as much as 70%, potentially feeding an additional 4 billion people, according to scientists at the University of Minnesota. Corn follows the practice of monocropping in the U.S., a method in which large amounts of land are used for producing only one type of crop, year after year. Ecologists warn against this practice due to its adverse consequences on soil biodiversity, which means it can deplete the soil of its nutrients and species variety. This monocropping culture has been supported by subsidies. Corn is the most subsidized crop in the country. With growing concerns over climate change and the associated issues of food security and scarcity, economists and ecologists have been questioning these subsidies, which harm the environment. They express concerns over whether the expansion of corn cultivation is truly the best use of land. Environmental Hazards Of Poultry Production Phosphorus, a chemical found in the manure of poultry birds such as turkey and chicken, is a pollutant that poses a threat to water bodies. The waste from poultry farms is spread as fertilizer on nearby areas, as the general belief is manure is a good source of nutrients for the soil. However, phosphorus, which leaks out of these fertilizers, is a key nutrient also for algae growth in water bodies. Leakage of this chemical destroys water clarity and depletes dissolved oxygen. Poultry giants such as Cargill and Tyson have repeatedly found themselves in lawsuits for polluting local water supplies due to improper manure treatment. For instance, earlier this year, after 18 years, Oklahoma won its lawsuit against Arkansas poultry producers over the pollution of the Illinois River, which runs between the two states, according to a recent court ruling. Such lawsuits can be reputational risks for the survival of these firms. This Thanksgiving, as Americans around the world express gratitude for their blessings, let the turkey centerpiece also prompt a moment of reflection on the trail of environmental challenges and the fact that the world is taking action. As the public, companies and investors become more aware of these issues, they’re holding each other accountable, and in this process, striving for a better planet.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'us', 'us']",us,True,True

The Horn of Africa has had five failed rainy seasons since 2019, according to the UN. The US and UN suspended aid earlier this year after allegations of theft, worsening the humanitarian crisis. Tigray is recovering from a two-year civil war which ended a year ago, while a conflict has erupted in Amhara. About 46 people died in the town of Yechila in Tigray, while six died in the neighbouring Amhara region of Wag Hemra, because of food shortages, the officials said. Over 4,000 cattle have died because of severe drought. As northern Ethiopia battles drought, the country's southern and eastern regions have been deluged by flash floods. In a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, the UN said that more than 370,000 people had fled their homes because of the floods. At least 43 people have been killed by the flooding and landslides in the eastern Somali region. During the war in Tigray, the region was cut off from humanitarian aid, leading to an unknown number of deaths. But it has been estimated that about 500,000 people may have died as a result of war, lack of medical supplies and hunger amid what were described as ""famine-like conditions"". The conflict ended after the Ethiopian government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) signed a peace deal brokered by the African Union (AU). After the conflict ended, there was a steady flow of aid until June, when the US and UN paused humanitarian assistance, staying it had been systematically stolen by corrupt officials. The US says widespread food deliveries will be resumed in December after significant reforms had been made to ensure that the supplies reached those who needed it most. Across East Africa, heavy rains and flash flooding have killed 130 people in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia in recent weeks, according to the Associated Press. The UN has described them as a ""once-in-a-century event"". In a statement, Fati N'Zi-Hassane, Oxfam in Africa Director said, the region was ""going from one disaster to the next as climatic shocks become more frequent and intense"". Somalia has been especially hit hard by the floods, after suffering from catastrophic droughts in recent years. The worst hit town is Beledweyne, where the Shabelle River burst its banks. The El Nino phenomenon has greatly affected East Africa. It is caused by warming in the Pacific Ocean and is linked to flooding, cyclones, drought and wildfires. Not all droughts or floods are due to climate change, but excess heat in the atmosphere is drawing more moisture out of the earth and making droughts worse, while a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.","['ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'sweden', 'sweden', 'kenya', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia']",gb,False,False

The researchers hypothesize that a rapid sea level rise in the North Sea flooded the area with salt water, causing the vast woodlands to disappear.The climate and environmental information these trees contain could be a valuable clue in determining whether this climate event could be related to other events that happened elsewhere in the world at the same time, including a megadrought in the Middle East that may have been a factor in the collapse of ancient Egypt's Old Kingdom. The researchers have published their findings inQuaternary Science Reviews.Credit: Tatiana BebchukYew trees (Taxus baccata) are one of the longest-lived species in Europe, and can reach up to 20 meters in height. While these trees are fairly common in Cambridge College gardens and churchyards across southern England, they are absent in the Fens, the low-lying marshy region of eastern England. Much of the Fens was a wetland until it was drained between the 17th and 19th centuries using artificial drainage and flood protection. Today, the area is some of the most productive farmland in the U.K., thanks to its rich peat soil.While the area is great for farming and does have its own charms, few people would describe the Fens as spectacular: for the most part, the area is extremely flat and dominated by fields of potatoes, sugar beet, wheat and other crops. But 5,000 years ago, the area was a huge forest.""A common annoyance for Fenland farmers is getting their equipment caught on big pieces of wood buried in the soil, which can often happen when planting potatoes, since they are planted a little deeper than other crops,"" said lead author Tatiana Bebchuk, a Ph.D. student from Cambridge's Department of Geography. ""This wood is often pulled up and piled at the edge of fields: it's a pretty common sight to see these huge piles of logs when driving through the area.""For farmers, these logs are a nuisance. But for Bebchuk and her colleagues, they are buried treasure. The Cambridge team approached several Fenland farmers and took samples of hundreds of logs that had been dug up and discarded, to find out what secrets they might hold.Inner part of the pile of subfossil yew trunks. Note fresh chain-saw cuts after sampling cross-sectional disks. Credit: Tatiana Bebchuk""I remember when I first saw this enormous pile of abandoned trees, it was incredible just how many there were,"" said Bebchuk. ""But when we got them back to lab, we were even more surprised: these trees were so well-preserved, it looked as if they were cut down just yesterday.""To put current anthropogenic climate change in a long-term context of natural variability, scientists need accurate evidence from the past, and trees are some of the best recorders of past conditions: their annual growth rings contain information about temperature and hydroclimate for every growing season they witnessed. ""But the further back in time we go, the less reliable evidence we have, since very old trees and well-preserved wood materials are extremely rare,"" said Professor Ulf Büntgen, the senior author of the study.However, analysis by the Cambridge Tree-Ring Unit (TRU) showed that the yew trees dug up from Fenland fields were very old indeed: some of these ancient trees were 400 years old when they died. The new find provides unique climate information for over a millennium from around 5,200 years ago until about 4,200 years ago, when much of the Fens was a woodland of yew and oak: completely different than it looks today.""Finding these veryold treesin the Fens is completely unexpected—it would be like turning a corner in rural Cambridgeshire and seeing an Egyptian pyramid—you just wouldn't expect it,"" said Bebchuk. ""It's the same with nature—wood rots and decomposes easily, so you just don't expect a tree that died 5,000 or 4,000 years ago to last so long.""Cross-section of a subfossil yew trunk after surface preparation. The disk contains 380 tree-rings, which means the tree was at least 380 years old when it died. Credit: Tatiana BebchukGiven that most of the Fens are barely above sea level, about 4,200 years ago, a sudden rise in sea level most likely killed the Fen woodlands. The period that the Fen woodlands died coincided with major climatic changes elsewhere in the world: at roughly the same time, a megadrought in China and the Middle East was a possible trigger of the collapse of several civilizations, including Egypt's Old Kingdom and the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia.""We want to know if there is any link between these climatic events,"" said Bebchuk. ""Are the megadroughts in Asia and the Middle East possibly related to the rapid sea level rise in northern Europe? Was this a global climate event, or was it a series of unrelated regional changes? We don't yet know what could have caused these climate events, but these trees could be an important part of solving this detective story.""""This is such a unique climate and environmental archive that will provide lots of opportunities for future studies, and it's right from Cambridge's own backyard,"" said Büntgen. ""We often travel all over the world to collect ice cores or ancient trees, but it's really special to find such a unique archive so close to the office.""","['unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'australia', 'australia', 'uk', 'finland', 'not found', 'not found', 'china', 'iraq']",gb,True,True

According to ADB, this move is expected to play a pivotal role in elevating urban living standards, ensuring clean water access, and bolstering climate resilience. Kochi, often referred to as the commercial capital of Kerala, has witnessed rapid urbanization, making it one of India 's fastest-growing urban centres. Despite nearly universal coverage, water availability in the city is characterized by intermittent supply, ranging from 5 to 24 hours a day, depending on the locality. This has led to the common sight of tanker trucks delivering water to areas facing low water pressure and inadequate supply. ADB's intervention comes against the backdrop of Kerala experiencing severe dry spells and droughts, notably in 2016, which severely impacted water availability. As climate projections indicate increased variability in rainfall frequency and rising temperatures, ensuring reliable and safe water services is deemed a critical climate adaptation strategy. Senior Urban Development Specialist Hikaru Shoji emphasizes the importance of providing quality water, highlighting its role in inclusive development, particularly impacting the health and well-being of vulnerable communities. Shoji said, ""Kerala has experienced severe dry spells and droughts, with the latest and most distressing one in 2016 that affected the availability of water. As climate projections point to varying frequency of rainfall and rising temperature, provision of reliable and safe water services is a critical climate adaptation strategy"". Shoji added, ""Access to quality water is a prerequisite for inclusive development as it affects the health and well-being of the population, especially in disadvantaged communities. Women, who are usually responsible for domestic work and care of family members, are directly affected by poor water access."" The project aims to mitigate these challenges and enhance access to quality water, a vital element of inclusive development. The ambitious project involves the rehabilitation and upgrade of five existing water treatment plants with a cumulative production capacity of 325 million litres per day (MLD). Additionally, a new plant with a capacity of 190 MLD will be constructed. To minimize treated water loss during distribution, around 700 kilometres of pipes will be replaced, accompanied by the introduction of a real-time monitoring system. Furthermore, approximately 146,000 water meters will be upgraded to high-quality and reliable meters. One of the distinctive features of this initiative is the introduction of preventive maintenance and asset management practices through a long-term performance-based contract. This encompasses the operation and maintenance of water distribution infrastructure, as well as rehabilitation and upgrading activities. Recognizing the importance of institutional capacity, the project seeks to strengthen the Kerala Water Authority (KWA). This involves the introduction of a mobile app for improved billing and collection, the development of a geographic information system-based maintenance management system, and the upgrading of the laboratory information system. Technical and managerial staff at KWA will undergo comprehensive training to enhance their expertise in various aspects of water supply services. In a bid to promote female employment in the construction, operation, and maintenance of water supply systems, the project places a special focus on training initiatives. Additionally, community awareness programs, involving active participation from women (50 per cent), will be conducted to improve knowledge on household supply, water audits, water quality, and hygiene. Topics such as menstrual hygiene and waterborne diseases will be addressed to ensure a holistic approach to community engagement. The Asian Development Bank, established in 1966 and owned by 68 members, has consistently championed the cause of sustainable development in the Asia-Pacific region. With a commitment to eradicating extreme poverty, ADB's endorsement of the Kochi water modernization project aligns with its broader goals of fostering prosperity, inclusivity, resilience, and sustainability. As the city of Kochi embarks on this transformative journey towards water infrastructure modernization, the ADB-backed initiative emerges as a beacon of hope for improved living conditions, climate adaptation, and sustainable urban development.

Global Seawater and Brackish Water Desalination Market to Reach $25.7 Billion by 2028 The need for sustainable sources of water is becoming increasingly evident in the face of growing populations and rising demands in agriculture and energy sectors. Population growth is a key factor driving water demand, and it is estimated that over half of the world's population will reside in water-stressed regions by 2050, as reported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This pressing issue extends to the risk of floods, which currently threatens 1.6 billion people. The German Federal Environment Agency predicts that by 2050, a quarter of the global population will grapple with chronic or regular water shortages. In fact, the World Economic Forum has identified water crises as the most concerning global risk over the next decade. Coastal regions, where a significant portion of the world's population resides, play a pivotal role in addressing water scarcity. Surprisingly, despite 40% of people living within 100 kilometers (62 miles) of a coastline, many still rely on water transported from inland or groundwater sources. However, desalination, the process of producing freshwater from saltwater, is on the rise. According to the United Nations World Water Development Report, as of 2022, approximately 1% of the world's water supply is generated through desalination. It takes about 1.5 liters of extracted water to produce 1 liter of desalinated water. The desalination capacity is swiftly expanding, with over 22,800 desalination plants providing around 110 million cubic meters of fresh water per day (m3/d) by the end of 2022, compared to 18,000 plants supplying 97 million m3/d in 2017. This capacity is projected to double by 2050. Amidst increasing demand, another challenge is the misuse and overuse of water resources. Freshwater sources are depleting at a faster rate due to environmental contamination and excessive extraction from non-renewable sources. Climate change, characterized by severe droughts, is exacerbating water scarcity issues in numerous regions. The ""Seawater and Brackish Water Desalination"" report addresses these critical water challenges. Covering more than 85% of the desalination industry, the report distinguishes between seawater and brackish water, which differ in their total dissolved solids (TDS) content. Each water source necessitates distinct treatment methods, with brackish water having a lower salt concentration than seawater. Desalination plants vary in size, ranging from small-scale to large industrial or municipal facilities. The report examines the global water resource scenario and the widening gap between freshwater availability and the water requirements of all sectors. It delves into the factors fueling the growth of the desalination equipment market and the hurdles it faces. The report provides a technical overview of the primary desalination technologies, focusing on both membrane-based and thermal-based methods. It also discusses novel desalination approaches. Additionally, the updated version incorporates an analysis of the industrial segment, encompassing industries such as oil and gas, chemicals, dairy, food and beverages, paper and pulp, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, power generation, and refineries. The report offers insights into the hypothetical unit cost of water production through various technologies and the sensitivity of this cost to economic variables. Furthermore, sustainability takes center stage in this report, with a dedicated chapter on the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) performance of companies involved in seawater and brackish water desalination. The market size, estimations, and forecasts are presented in terms of value ($ millions), with 2022 as the base year and projections extending from 2023 to 2028. The report also furnishes regional-level market data categorized by technology and application. In summary, the global seawater and brackish water desalination market is not only addressing water scarcity but also presenting opportunities for growth and innovation in the quest for sustainable water solutions.

International … [+7031 chars]",COVID,"Communities around the world faceincreasingly severeandfrequent impactsfrom climate change. They are on the ""frontlines"" of droughts, flooding, desertification and sea level rise.International climate finance is supposed to help. In the 2015 Paris Agreement, the world's wealthiest countries pledgedUS$50 billion annuallyto supportclimate adaptationamong those ""particularly vulnerable"" toclimate change. Climate adaptation is the adjustments humans make to reduce exposure to climate risk.Eight years later, it is clear that this money is failing to reach vulnerable ""frontline communities"", especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Recently, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi, South Sudan and Niger have been among thetop ten most affected countries.The host country of the upcoming annual United Nations climate negotiations (COP28), the United Arab Emirates, has announced it is focused on ""fixing climate finance"".I am a researcher who has studied international climate finance for seven years, both at the annual COPs and through research inMadagascar, Mauritius andNamibia. My work explores how to make climate finance more equitable and accessible for vulnerable communities.It's my view that the countries that contribute the bulk of the funding for climate adaptation can ensure more money reaches those who need it most. To do that they must first understand why financing isn't reaching frontline communities. Otherwise money will continue to fall well short of need.Why funding isn't reaching vulnerable communitiesThe clearest reason why adaptation finance does not reach these communities is that there is simply not enough of it. Wealthy countries haveconsistently failedto deliver on the US$50 billion commitment. Every year the gap between needs and support grows. The latestAdaptation Gap Reportestimates that international adaptation finance is 10–18 times below need.Beyond this shortfall, the current structure of climate finance prevents frontline communities from accessing support.Studies showthat the poorest and most vulnerable countries receive less than their fair share of adaptation finance. Support for sub-Saharan African countries is as little as US$5 per person per year.Two key barriers explain this disconnect. The first is the overlap of climate vulnerability with conflict andpolitical instability.Twelve of the 20 countriesmost vulnerable to climate change are also affected by conflict. Vulnerable countries are also prone to political turmoil, frequent changes in government, and high levels of government corruption.UN climate funds and other major funders like the World Bank see these countries as less ""ready"" for adaptation projects.My researchhas also found thatwealthy countriesworry their taxpayers' money will be lost to corruption.The second barrier is the finance application process. Proposals for UN climate funds, such as theGreen Climate Fund, can number hundreds of pages. Application requirements differ from fund to fund. It can take years to develop a proposal and to receive the money.Reaching frontline communitiesEven when vulnerable countries receive international support, further barriers can prevent it from reaching frontline communities. Currently, only17% of adaptation finance has reached local levels. My research inMadagascar and Mauritiusfound both administrative and political barriers.National governments consume resources administering grants, often hiring expensive foreign consultants to plan, implement and monitor projects. These costs eat into the money intended for local communities. The focus on large, individual projects tends to concentrate funding in one area, limiting how far benefits can reach.Funds also require clear evidence of success. Governments might invest in projects they know will succeed rather than take innovative approaches or choose riskier areas.National governments also make decisions for political reasons. They tend to distribute resources—including money for adaptation—based on what will help them stay in power. They are more likely to fund political supporters than opponents. Communities are often vulnerable precisely because they are politically marginalized.Finally, studies show that adaptation finance, like development funding, can be lost to corruption and mismanagement. Wealthy and powerful elites can""capture"" the benefitsof internationally financed projects, such as adisproportionate share of rice seedsfor a project to build the resilience of agriculture in Madagascar.How to fix itIt is not too late to change how adaptation finance flows to ensure more of it reaches vulnerable communities. The first step is to increase funding for adaptation. Support for adaptationactually declined in 2021, the most recent year for which we have data. Wealthy countries must meet the commitments they made in the Paris Agreement.The second step is for UN funds, the World Bank and wealthy countries to dedicate a greater proportion of funding to the most vulnerable countries. They must do so regardless of whether these countries are affected by conflict, instability and corruption.For UN funds this can be accomplished by simplifying and standardizing application procedures. Funds can also dedicate more resources to help countries prepare proposals. They should focus less on demanding clear results and more on supporting adaptation that aligns with national and local priorities.Wealthy countries that contribute to climate funds need to give up some power over the money. They will have to accept imperfect governance and that some funding will be lost to mismanagement and corruption. They have tolerated such trade-offs before, such as during theCOVID pandemic, when urgency outweighed concerns over waste and fraud.But funders should also push for increased transparency around projects. They can encourage scrutiny by local civil society groups, for example, by publishing project information in local languages.The third step is to experiment. For example, the Green Climate Fund is currently experimenting with""decentralized"" adaptation financein Namibia. Rather than a single large project, the Namibian government broke the funds into 31 small grants for community-based organizations. Together with the University of Namibia, we areexamining whether and howthis approach helps more funding reach frontline communities. Early results are encouraging.Fixing climatefinanceis not simple, but it is urgent. Failing to do so means leaving the most vulnerable alone to face the increasing threats ofclimatechange.","['mozambique', 'zimbabwe', 'southsudan', 'niger', 'unitedstates', 'madagascar', 'namibia']",gb,False,False

For hundreds of years, people have shaped the world around them for their benefit: They drained lakes, deforested lands and mined for metals and minerals to grow wealth and economies. They dug up billions of tons of coal, and then oil and gas, to fuel empires and economies. The allure of exploiting nature and burning fossil fuels as a path to prosperity hopped from nation to nation, each eager to secure their own cheap energy. Over hundreds of years, that impulse has remade the planet's climate, too - and brought its inhabitants to the brink of catastrophe. Anya Zilberstein, a historian of climate science at Concordia University in Montreal, highlighted Europeans colonizing the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries as major factor of today's climate and environmental crises. ""They bring with them this idea that conquest and then the development of the cultivation of landscapes, like taking down trees, opening up lands to European-style agriculture, that the draining of swamps ... will also change the climate, usually for the better,"" Zilberstein said. Jan Golinski, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire, said Europeans of the time thought that their changes - cutting down forests, draining swamps, plowing land - would change the climate as well, to something closer to their homelands. He said they saw this engineering as positive. ""They believed that their society was making progress,"" Golinski said. That early modern period solidified notions of industry, progress, productivity and growth that make it harder to tackle the current climate crisis, Zilberstein said. Then, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the balance tipped dramatically in coal's favor as an energy source, through technological advances like steam power, new transportation routes like canals and later railroads, and a desire to better control how, when and where energy was used. Steam power made it easier for factory owners to control labour and nature than an economy based on water power, for example, because they could be set up anywhere and weren't vulnerable to floods or droughts said Andreas Malm, an associate professor of human ecology at Lund University in Sweden. The British then ""forcibly exported this model and integrated other countries such as India or Egypt or what became Nigeria into a kind of an economy that was dependent on fossil fuel"", said Malm. Other nations then began ""searching for fossil fuels in various places in the Ottoman Empire, in the Indian subcontinent and elsewhere"", said On Barak, a historian at Tel Aviv University and co-founder of the Laboratory for the History of Climate Change. Then came oil. Oil use grew in the late 19th century because it wasn't as labour-intensive as coal, whose workers now had strong unions in some Western nations, historians say. Like coal, oil was easy to store, it's more energy-rich than coal, and it's easier to move; as a liquid it can be shipped through pipes, as well as by trucks, tankers and railcars, said J.R. McNeill, a historian at Georgetown University. By the 20th century, the growth in oil helped fuel technologies like cars and air travel that became more affordable in many global north countries. Other nations such as China, Japan and India began assembling their own energy regimes based on fossil fuels. As Europe, the US and Japan built their energy systems around internal combustion engines, it made the global investment in an oil-dominated fossil fuel regime ""gigantic and harder, but not impossible, to reverse or replace"", McNeill said. Meanwhile, coal kept its place in the global economy. In China and Japan, growing consumption was a signal and barometer of developing economies, said Victor Seow, a historian of science at Harvard University. After the Communist Revolution in 1949, the Chinese government measured growth by its production of items like cloth, electricity, wheat, iron, steel - and coal, too. Japan studied Western mining to develop their own coal fields. China is now the world's current largest greenhouse gas emitter, although the United States still trumps it historically. India has also become a major coal-burning nation. Fredrik Albritton Jonsson, a historian at the University of Chicago, said humans can decide what kind of world they want to live in, and tailor their development within nature's boundaries. ""There are two kinds of boundaries to this economy,"" said Fredrik Albritton Jonsson, a historian at the University of Chicago. ""One is a sort of upper boundary of planetary limits"" of what our natural world can withstand, ""and then there's a lower boundary, that would guarantee minimum social needs, entitlements, the right to education, the right to clean water, the right to a steady income"".

Shukri Abdi Osman, a 34-year-old mother of three, is sheltering in a camp for the displaced in Dolow with her children, among around 700 families forced to flee as flash floods engulfed many parts of town. ""I have never seen such devastating floods before, everything happened quickly. When we realised the water was coming it was too late to collect all our belongings. We left our houses at midnight and all we were able to grab was our children,"" she told AFP. As the family breadwinner, Osman said she thought she had a bright future, with plans to expand her flourishing fruit and vegetable kiosk in the Garbolow neighbourhood of Dolow, which lies on the Juba River near the Ethiopia border. ""But I ended up here in this IDP settlement hopelessly waiting for the situation to change. My business is gone, my property is destroyed, and my house engulfed in water,"" she said, as she struggled to light firewood to cook a meal for her children. And now disease is posing a threat to her family. ""The toilets were destroyed and even the tap water is now mixed with the dirty flood water which includes leaking septic tanks,"" she said. ""The situation is very tough now in this camp with my daughter feeling unwell, she might have already contracted malaria and typhoid."" Somalia's government has declared a state of emergency over what the United Nations has called ""once-in-a-century"" flooding, with almost 100 lives lost across the country and 700,000 people made homeless. Torrential rains linked to the El Nino weather phenomenon have lashed the Horn of Africa on the heels of the worst drought in 40 years that drove millions to the brink of famine in Somalia. It is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, locked in a vicious cycle of drought and floods. But is particularly ill-equipped to cope with the crisis as it battles deep poverty and a deadly Islamist insurgency. In one of the worst El Nino episodes, in late 1997 and early 1998, at least 1,800 people died in Somalia alone when the Juba River burst its banks. The latest floods have washed away homes, schools, farmland, roads and bridges, leaving many without shelter, food or clean drinking water. Mohamed Dahir, water and sanitation officer with US charity Mercy Corps, told AFP that humanitarian agencies are now concerned about those vulnerable to disease. ""The possibility for malaria outbreak is high due to the mosquitos, and there are also concerns about watery diarrhoea breaking out due to the possible contamination of the water system."" ""We still don't know exactly the level of contamination but what we have seen is the leaked septic tanks and destroyed toilets of the affected neighbourhood which contaminate the water wells."" The UN humanitarian agency OCHA said in an update last week that 33 districts of Somalia had been deluged, with a significant increase in cases of Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) or cholera and a rise in malaria cases. It said there were concerns that contaminated stagnant water around schools poses a ""serious risk"" of waterborne diseases for school children. Sadia Sharif Hassan, a 40-year-old mother of seven, sits in a makeshift shelter in a Dolow IDP camp, begging her neighbour for a container so she can fetch water. ""The most important thing is to save the lives of our children,"" she told AFP, saying the family barely had enough food to eat each day. ""The mosquitos are relentless and several of my children are already feeling unwell, they are suffering from fever... all their bodies are covered with bites now."" In Garboolow, 70-year-old Owliyo Mohamed Abdirahman almost slipped and fell in the mud as she tried to rescue belongings from her damaged corrugated metal home but found everything had been swept away. ""This is what is left of my house in which I lived with my son who is sick now, his children and his wife,"" she said in despair. ""We ran away with our lives and carried nothing else."" She and her family are having to rely on the kindness of well-wishers who have provided food and clothing. Somalia has been locked in an endless cycle of drought and floods. In one of the worst El Nino episodes, in late 1997 and early 1998, at least 1,800 people died when the Juba River burst its banks.

For hundreds of years, people have shaped the world around them for their benefit: They drained lakes to protect infrastructure, wealth and people. They dug up billions of tons of coal, and then oil and gas, to fuel empires and economies. The allure of exploiting nature and burning fossil fuels as a path to prosperity hopped from nation to nation, each eager to secure their own energy. People who claimed the power to control nature and the energy resources around them saw theenvironmentas a tool to be used for progress, historians say. Over hundreds of years, that impulse has remade the planet's climate, too — and brought its inhabitants to the brink of catastrophe. Mexico City traces its roots to a settlement centuries ago on islands in the midst of Lake Texcoco. These days, most of the lake is gone, drained long ago to make room for the building and growth that today has more than 22 million people sprawling toward the edges of the Valley ofMexico. Getting water in the arid valley — a need that has spiked as droughts have worsened — relies on pumping from deep underground. The toll of centuries of such pumping can be seen in curbs that crumble and structures that tilt atop the resulting subsidence, with some areas sinking around 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) a year. At the same time, neighborhoods are at increased risk of severe flooding because of climate change-fueled extreme rain events and drainage systems that are less effective because of the subsidence. “Nature doesn’t create these huge problems,” said Luis Zambrano, professor of ecology at the National University Autónoma of Mexico. “Nature behaves as nature ... we are increasing our vulnerability by allowing the city to sink by pumping as much water as we possibly can from the aquifer."" Mexico City is just one example of people and empires altering their natural environments in ways they believe will benefit themselves and the land. Elsewhere, huge swathes of land have been deforested for agriculture or livestock grazing, or degraded and contaminated by quarrying and mining for metals and minerals. Tapping nature for its resources drove progress and productivity for some, but it's also been a major driver of emissions and environmental degradation. Anya Zilberstein, a historian of climate science at Concordia University in Montreal, highlighted the example of Europeans colonizing the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries as an early catalyst for modern-day climate and environmental crises. “They bring with them this idea that conquest and then the development of the cultivation of landscapes, like taking down trees, opening up lands to European style agriculture, that the draining of swamps ... will also change the climate, usually for the better,” Zilberstein said. The Aztecs built Tenochtitlán — what became Mexico City — on the lake's islands and chinampas — small, artificial fields. When the city later fell under Spain's rule, it was seen as the “most gorgeous jewel in the Spanish empire,"" with ornate palaces and commercial hubs, said Vera S. Candiani, a historian of Latin America at Princeton. Catastrophic flooding in the mid-16th century led the Spanish to pursue drainage projects that aimed to keep the city dry and prosperous, and stretched on for three centuries, Candiani said. But not everyone benefited equally. Candiani said that capital-owning elites got technicians, engineers and other professionals to implement a system of extracting resources and labor from the countryside to benefit the city in colonial Mexico, and more broadly from the colonies for the gain of the home country. Rural populations, who contributed the most to the project through coerced labor, didn't benefit. Jan Golinski, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire, said Europeans of the time thought that their changes — cutting down forests, draining swamps, plowing land — would change the climate as well, to something closer to their homelands. He said they saw this engineering as positive. “They believed that their society was making progress, that it was gaining greater control over nature, that they were becoming more civilized and were civilizing the environment around them,” Golinski said. It’s a belief that several historians say is rooted in feelings of racial and cultural superiority. “We hear echoes of these tropes"" in the present day, said Deborah Coen, a historian of science at Yale. Being more vulnerable to climate extremes is associated with populations of color, and at the same time, “we find white elites pursuing projects of climate adaptation that protect themselves at the expense of communities of color,” she said. For example, residents in areas that were deemed safer from extreme weather following wildfires in Maui this summer are now getting priced out of their own neighborhoods. The early modern period's ideas on race have “long tentacles into the present,” said Zilberstein, and also solidified notions of environmental control, productivity and growth as positive, making it harder to tackle the current climate crisis. “There are plenty of people who would say, yes, I believe climate change is real and I’ll go on a march, but I can’t accept de-growth,"" she said. “And I understand why businesses won’t commit to it and nations won’t commit to it. It’s sort of unfathomable. It goes against the deeply held ideology of progress.” While Mexico City was built over water, Britain was sitting on vast expanses of coal that would eventually help form the blanket of carbon dioxide emissions that now clogs the atmosphere. Coal had long been used in homes on the island for heating and cooking. It wasn't the only source of energy — timber, water and peat were in use as well — but the balance tipped dramatically in its favor through the late 18th and early 19th centuries through technological inventions like steam power, new transportation routes like canals and later railroads, and a desire to better control how, when and where energy was used. When the steam economy arrived — engines fueled by coal to heat water and make steam power — it made it easier for factory owners to control labor and nature than an economy based on water power, for example, said Andreas Malm, an associate professor of human ecology at Lund University in Sweden. “Steam engines were mobile in space, so you could erect them anywhere, and the great benefit of this was that you could concentrate steam factories in towns where there was access to cheap and disciplined labor power,” said Malm. Steam power was also less vulnerable to the droughts, floods and storms that could affect water power: “You could just turn it on at any point in the day, regardless of the weather outside.” It made coal the central energy-maker for British manufacturing and transport. “Britain forcibly exported this model and integrated other countries such as India or Egypt or what became Nigeria into a kind of an economy that was dependent on fossil fuel,” said Malm. By the mid-19th century, steam power was adopted in manufacturing, cotton mills, steam ships and locomotives around the world, turning coal into a global trade. On Barak, a historian at Tel Aviv University and co-founder of the Laboratory for the History of Climate Change, likened steam engines and coal to the British empire giving other states coffee machines and capsules. Nations consistently needed to buy new capsules, or coal, for their coffee machines, or steam engines, feeding an ongoing addiction. “This kickstarts ... searching for fossil fuels in various places in the Ottoman Empire, in the Indian subcontinent and elsewhere,” he said. And while it led to some discoveries, other empires and nations kept coming back to the more energy-rich British coal. Centuries later, the United Kingdom has nearly weaned itself off coal, with weeks or months at a stretch where the national grid gets no coal power. The U.K. plans to stop using coal for the production of electricity by the end of next year, although it’s still used in heavy industry like steel-making, with a new coal mine approved in Cumbria as late as 2022. But the country’s move away from coal wasn’t before its empire left its sooty footprint around the world. Its legacy can also be seen at home, where many of the mining and port towns in the north of England and parts of Wales and Scotland once buoyed by coal now languish, and abandoned mines and heaps of waste and debris scar the landscape. Previous centuries created the right conditions for human-caused climate change, but the last few generations made it a reality. In 1960, humans put about 9 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the air; in 2021, they produced more than four times that amount, according to the Global Carbon Project. Energy use skyrocketed as cars, air travel and technology became more affordable in many North American and European countries. Other nations such as China, Japan and India were assembling their own energy regimes based on fossil fuels. And this all happened amid growing understanding and concern about heat-trapping gases. Oil use grew in the late 19th century because it wasn't as labor-intensive as coal, an industry whose workers now had strong unions in some Western nations, historians say. Like coal, oil was easy to store. It is more energy-rich than coal, and it's easier to move; as a liquid it can be shipped through pipes, as well as by trucks, tankers and railcars, said J.R. McNeill, a historian at Georgetown University. The rise of automobiles in the 1920s led the U.S. to build its energy system and much of its technology around internal combustion engines that still dominate cars, ships and planes. And as Europe and Japan followed suit, it made the global investment in an oil-dominated fossil fuel regime “gigantic and harder, but not impossible, to reverse or replace,” McNeill said. Meanwhile, coal kept its place in the global economy. In China and Japan, growing consumption was a barometer of economic development by the early 20th century, said Harvard historian of science Victor Seow. After the Communist Revolution in 1949, the Chinese government measured growth by its production of items like cloth, electricity, wheat, iron, steel — and coal, too, which was key measure of growth. Japan studied Western mining to develop its own coal fields in both its home islands and empire. China is the world's current largest greenhouse gas emitter, although the United States still trumps it historically. In India, too, which was part of the British Empire until it gained independence in 1947, coal was used to further the country's development and help state governments win popular support, said Elizabeth Chatterjee, a historian at the University of Chicago. India set up state-owned coal-fired plants and started electrifying its cities and larger farms, with many other rural areas not coming online until the early 21st century. And they electrified while also understanding the environmental risks of coal, she said. “Indira Gandhi, as early as 1981, spoke publicly about climate change, for example, as a threat, but plowed on with this (coal) regardless,"" Chatterjee said. “If you're a country with few resources, what choice do you have?” In the United States, environmental issues started gaining traction in the 1960s and '70s, with the first Earth Day in 1970, said Joshua Howe, an environmental historian at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. He cited major legislation — to create the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Endangered Species Act — as “really big responses to that really big moment.” But tackling fossil fuels — what Howe called “the center of the global economy” — was more difficult. Yale's Coen described fear in the U.S. around discussing how to adapt to weather extremes caused by climate change that were already unavoidable in the late 20th century. Talking about adaptation was seen as a risk to detract from the will to slash emissions, she said. Howe also noted unwillingness to join international climate agreements, including a unanimous U.S. Senate vote in 1997 against signing any climate treaty that would mandate cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. That vote ""was, in my opinion, pretty much when optimism for a national-level commitment to climate mitigation — especially via international agreements — went up in smoke,” Howe said. But many historians agree, amid the gloom of spiraling concerns about the climate and environment, that radical shifts away from centuries-old ideas of progress can shape a better future. Fredrik Albritton Jonsson, a historian at the University of Chicago, said if humans rethink the need for persistent growth, societies can operate within the restrictions of finite resources and atmospheric limits. “There are two kinds of boundaries to this economy,” said Jonsson. “One is a sort of upper boundary of planetary limits” of what our natural world can withstand, “and then there’s a lower boundary, that would guarantee minimum social needs, entitlements, the right to education, the right to clean water, the right to a steady income.” ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

So also our street lights issues will soon become history,” adding, “While this project will be inaugurated on January 29, 2023, we are still on a similar project in Challawa Goje Dam, where we are generating six megawatts.”A senior government official in the know about the project but pleaded anonymity, confided inArewa PUNCHwhile corroborating the governor’s claim, that the project upon take-off would truly ensure the availability of drinking water for the huge Kano populace and reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases which had persistently plagued the town for decades due to lack of potable water.A resident, Hadjia Khadijat, who spoke with our correspondent, disclosed that most of the time, the residents, especially those from the eight local government metropolitan areas were left with no option but to source water from boreholes and other water vendors, thereby exposing themselves to unclean water that could cause cholera outbreak.According to her, the residents are also forced to pay the heavy price burden for water because water vendors, always take advantage of the absence of running water in a densely populated state like Kano, to make brisk business.However, several residents who are familiar with the development have identified the epileptic power supply as one major factor responsible for the acute water shortage in Kano State, while others put the blame on the growing population.Arewa PUNCHinvestigations further revealed that the Kano metropolitan areas alone would require at least 210 million litres of water from the Challawa complex daily, but yet, gets only about 50 million litres being pumped due to the ongoing expansion project in the area.An official at the state Water Board told our correspondent that once the project is completed, the Tamburawa treatment plant will produce 150 million litres of water, and the Challawa complex will produce 210 million litres, for a total of 360 million litres of water per day.Related NewsGovernorship Election Live UpdatesKano uncovers 13-year-old girl, corpers among ineligible workers collecting salariesN4bn fraud trial: Ex-Kano MD, son get bailKano detected 26,271 tuberculosis cases in 2022 – OfficialMeanwhile, in his bid to put an end to the predicaments, the former governor had equally announced that the 10-megawatt power plant was now ready for inauguration in a bid to make it pump water for the state and improve street lighting.In addition, stakeholders say they strongly expect that most of the industries that had cut down on production over lack of steady power supply would come alive and reabsorb their workers who were laid off due to inadequate power supply from the Kano Electricity Distribution Company.As a result, not a few observers and stakeholders insisted that the hydropower station would improve the socio-economic activities of the residents as well as enhance security at night as the street lights will be powered from the station.The power station they noted would have been one of the legacies the administration of former Governor Abdullahi Ganduje would have successfully bequeathed to Kano State if it had been commissioned and the project put to public use as promised.The Tiga Independent Power Plant project was initially awarded by the administration of the former governor of the state, Engr. Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso to generate 35MW, using Challawa and Tiga dams.However, when former governor, Abdullahi Ganduje came to power in 2015, he reviewed the project to 13.2MW, after observing that it could yield the desired result and vowed to commission the project before leaving office in May 2023, which he never did.Therefore, it was a big relief to the residents when Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf recently requested the State House of Assembly to approve and grant him access to a loan of N4bn from the Central Bank of Nigeria for the completion of the Tiga and Challawa Hydro-electric power projects, an approval which the House had since granted him.This is a project initiated by the administration of the former governor Rabi’u Kwankwaso, to generate 35MW, using Challawa and Tiga dams. Former Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, who came into power in 2015 and “pretended to be desirous of continuing with the project,” a source volunteered.He asked teasingly, “Is it not funny that there was no genuine sincerity on the part of the former administration over the project, otherwise how is it that, while Ganduje had before leaving office, claimed to have completed the project and was at the test-running stage, now Governor Kabir Yusuf is trying to access a N4bn loan from the Central Bank of Nigeria to complete it?”However, speaking on the issue, the State Commissioner of Works, Engr. Marwan Ahmad said the administration of former Governor Abdullahi Ganduje secured a N4bn loan from the Central Bank of Nigeria, and CBN released the money to Fidelity Bank.He said “But because the money was released to Fidelity Bank at the tail end of the Ganduje administration, the Bank refused to release the money to Ganduje’s government for fear of misappropriating the money by the outgoing government.“So, when this government came, it revalidated the loan and requested for the state Assembly’s approval to access the loan with a view to completing the project,” Ahmad clarified. The much-touted project was initiated as part of the renewed efforts to address the persistent energy challenges, which is responsible for the hiccups being experienced over the effective operation of water treatment plants and street lights in the state.Arewa PUNCHrecalls that a former governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, had shortly before leaving office announced that the Tiga 10 megawatts Hydro Power Station had been completed and would be inaugurated on January 29, 2023.He had also informed the residents that the project was already at the pre-launching test stage.Ganduje, who gave the assurance during a visit to the Tiga power plant and Tamburawa Water Treatment Plant, had stressed that the multi-billion naira hydropower station when fully operational would be deployed into the power Tamburawa Water Treatment Plant so as to ensure steady and uninterrupted water supply to the Kano metropolis as well as power the metropolitan street lights which will go a long way at improving security during the night.Ganduje had said, “With the way it was designed from the beginning of the process, the 10 megawatts generated from Tiga station will be used to take care of the Tamburawa Water Treatment Plant and the metropolitan street lights.”Continuing, the governor had also maintained that, “with this, our water issue will be dealt with decisively.

A senior government official in the know about the project but pleaded anonymity, confided inArewa PUNCHwhile corroborating the governor’s claim, that the project upon take-off would truly ensure the availability of drinking water for the huge Kano populace and reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases which had persistently plagued the town for decades due to lack of potable water.A resident, Hadjia Khadijat, who spoke with our correspondent, disclosed that most of the time, the residents, especially those from the eight local government metropolitan areas were left with no option but to source water from boreholes and other water vendors, thereby exposing themselves to unclean water that could cause cholera outbreak.According to her, the residents are also forced to pay the heavy price burden for water because water vendors, always take advantage of the absence of running water in a densely populated state like Kano, to make brisk business.However, several residents who are familiar with the development have identified the epileptic power supply as one major factor responsible for the acute water shortage in Kano State, while others put the blame on the growing population.Arewa PUNCHinvestigations further revealed that the Kano metropolitan areas alone would require at least 210 million litres of water from the Challawa complex daily, but yet, gets only about 50 million litres being pumped due to the ongoing expansion project in the area.An official at the state Water Board told our correspondent that once the project is completed, the Tamburawa treatment plant will produce 150 million litres of water, and the Challawa complex will produce 210 million litres, for a total of 360 million litres of water per day.Related NewsGovernorship Election Live UpdatesKano uncovers 13-year-old girl, corpers among ineligible workers collecting salariesN4bn fraud trial: Ex-Kano MD, son get bailKano detected 26,271 tuberculosis cases in 2022 – OfficialMeanwhile, in his bid to put an end to the predicaments, the former governor had equally announced that the 10-megawatt power plant was now ready for inauguration in a bid to make it pump water for the state and improve street lighting.In addition, stakeholders say they strongly expect that most of the industries that had cut down on production over lack of steady power supply would come alive and reabsorb their workers who were laid off due to inadequate power supply from the Kano Electricity Distribution Company.As a result, not a few observers and stakeholders insisted that the hydropower station would improve the socio-economic activities of the residents as well as enhance security at night as the street lights will be powered from the station.The power station they noted would have been one of the legacies the administration of former Governor Abdullahi Ganduje would have successfully bequeathed to Kano State if it had been commissioned and the project put to public use as promised.The Tiga Independent Power Plant project was initially awarded by the administration of the former governor of the state, Engr.
