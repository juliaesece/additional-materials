""The rooftops of the world are caving in,"" Guterres said on a visit to the Everest region in mountainous Nepal, adding that the country had lost nearly a third of its ice in just over three decades. ""Glaciers are icy reservoirs -- the ones here in the Himalayas supply fresh water to well over a billion people,"" he said. ""When they shrink, so do river flows."" Nepal's glaciers melted 65 percent faster in the last decade than in the previous one, said Guterres, who is on a four-day visit to Nepal. Glaciers in the wider Himalayan and Hindu Kush ranges are a crucial water source for around 240 million people in the mountainous regions, as well as for another 1.65 billion people in the South Asian and Southeast Asian river valleys below. The glaciers feed 10 of the world's most important river systems, including the Ganges, Indus, Yellow, Mekong and Irrawaddy, and directly or indirectly supply billions of people with food, energy, clean air and income. Scientists say they are melting faster than ever before due to climate change, exposing communities to unpredictable and costly disasters. ""I am here today to cry out from the rooftop of the world: stop the madness"", Guterres said, speaking from Syangboche village, with the icy peak of the world's highest mountain Everest towering behind him. ""The glaciers are retreating, but we cannot. We must end the fossil fuel age,"" he said. The world has warmed an average of nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius since the mid-1800s, unleashing a cascade of extreme weather, including more intense heatwaves, more severe droughts and storms made more ferocious by rising seas. Hardest hit are the most vulnerable people and the world's poorest countries, which have done little to contribute to the fossil fuel emissions that drive up temperatures. ""We must act now to protect people on the frontline, and to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, to avert the worst of climate chaos,"" Guterres said. ""The world can't wait."" In the first phase of climate change's effects, melting glaciers can trigger destructive floods. ""Melting glaciers mean swollen lakes and rivers flooding, sweeping away entire communities"", he added. But all too soon, glaciers will dry up if change is not made, he warned. ""In the future, major Himalayan rivers like the Indus, the Ganges and Brahmaputra could have massively reduced flows, he said. ""That spells catastrophe"".","['nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'sweden', 'laos']",us,False,False

The flash floods seem to have been triggered by a combination of factors. A cloud burst ripped apart the South Shonak Lake — a glacial body in the state’s northwest. According to Sikkim’s Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), the Teesta has inundated at least four districts in the state. The calamity was aggravated by the release of water from the Chungthang dam — initial reports suggest that the breach was caused by water rushing from the mountains. Disaster management authorities are also investigating the possibility of the event being triggered by an earthquake in Nepal on Tuesday. The probe is likely to throw more light on the immediate causes of the flash flood but one thing has long been clear — states in the Himalayan region must respect the fragile ecology of the mountains and put in adequate safeguards to mitigate the damage caused by increasingly frequent extreme rainfall events. For years, studies have red-flagged the South Shonak Lake’s expansion due to glacial melting and warned that the water body is susceptible to breaches. In 2021, for instance, a study by scientists from IIT Roorkee, Indian Institute of ScienceBangalore, University of Dayton, USA, University of Graz, Austria, and the Universities of Zurich and Geneva in Switzerland recommended regular monitoring of the lake’s growth and continuous assessment of the region’s slope stability. The National Disaster Management Authority guidelines also say that risk reduction has to begin with mapping such water bodies, taking structural measures to prevent their breach and establishing mechanisms that can alert people about glacial lake outbursts. The IMD has collaborated with the US National Weather Service to warn people about six to 24 hours before a flash flood. But the system doesn’t seem to have come to terms with the Himalayan region’s idiosyncrasies. The Northeast has a key place in the hydel power push of successive governments at the Centre. The Chungthang Dam is a part of the 1,200 MW Teesta Stage 3 Hydroelectric Project. The government claims that such projects are climate-friendly because of their low emissions intensity. Hydroelectric power is also a major source of revenue for Sikkim. Ecologists, however, caution against the adverse effects of dam construction — it increases the volatility of rocks in the Himalayan region. Wednesday’s disaster is a warning to take such caveats seriously and install robust safety mechanisms.","['india', 'india', 'nepal', 'unitedstates', 'austria', 'switzerland', 'switzerland', 'france']",in,True,True

Scientists are increasingly watching how climate change is impacting the environmentally fragile Himalayas, home to the planet's tallest peaks and the source of water for rivers that hundreds of millions of people depend on. Since the end of September, a Chinese team has set up five automatic weather stations on Cho Oyu, at altitudes from 4,950m to its summit at 8,201m, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Friday (Oct 6). Snow and ice samples at the summit had been collected for the first time, Xinhua reported. Initial research showed that the ice layer on Cho Oyu was the thickest among peaks above 8,000m, with a thickness of more than 70m being seen, Xinhua reported. The weather stations on Cho Oyu, which means ""Turquoise Goddess"" in Tibetan, expand a Chinese meteorological network in the Himalayas that includes monitoring of the 8,848m Everest, also on the border with Nepal, and the 8,013m Shishapangma in Tibet. Monitoring the effects of global warming has taken on urgency after one of the warmest summers in the northern hemisphere this year.Mont Blanc, Western Europe's highest peak, has lost more than 2m in height over two yearsbecause of its shrinking snowpack, researchers said on Thursday. Torrential rain in India's northeastern Sikkim state burst the banks of a glacial lake and triggered flash floodsthis week, killing at least 40 people in the latest example of extreme weather events in the mountain range that scientists have blamed on climate change. High-altitude surveillance was imperative to avoid disasters such as floods and ice avalanches as glaciers melt, Xinhua reported, citing Yang Wei, a researcher at the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research of Chinese Academy of Sciences.","['china', 'china', 'china', 'china', 'china', 'china', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'india']",sg,False,False

Violent flooding from glacier lakes dammed by loose rock has become more frequent as global temperatures rise and ice melts, with climate scientists warning it poses an increasing danger across the wider Himalayan mountain range. ""At least 10 people were killed and 102 others reported missing,"" Prabhakar Rai, director of the Sikkim state disaster management authority, told AFP a day after a wall of water rushed down the mountainous valley in northeastern India. Authorities said roads had been ""severely"" damaged and that 14 bridges had been washed away. Rescuers were battling to help those hit by the flood, with communications cut across large areas and roads blocked. ""Floodwaters have caused havoc in four districts of the state, sweeping away people, roads, bridges,"" Himanshu Tiwari, an Indian Army spokesman, told AFP. Twenty-two soldiers are among the missing, the army said. One previously missing soldier was rescued. The army was working to reestablish telephone connections and provide ""medical aid to tourists and locals stranded"", it said in a statement. The water surge came after intense rainfall burst the high-altitude Lhonak Lake, which sits at the base of a glacier in peaks surrounding the world's third-highest mountain, Kangchenjunga. Himalayan glaciers are melting faster than ever due to climate change, exposing communities to unpredictable and costly disasters, according to the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) research group. Water powered downstream, adding to a river already swollen by monsoon rains, damaging a dam, sweeping away houses and bridges, and causing ""serious destruction"", the Sikkim state government said. Damage was recorded more than 120 kilometres (75 miles) downstream, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised ""all possible support"" for those affected. Lhonak Lake shrunk by nearly two-thirds in size, an area roughly equivalent to about 150 football pitches (105 hectares), satellite photographs released by the Indian Space Research Organisation showed. ""Intense rain has led to this catastrophic situation in Sikkim where the rain has triggered a glacial lake outburst flood and damaged a dam, and caused loss of life,"" said Miriam Jackson, a scientist specialising in ice who monitors Himalayan regions with the Nepal-based ICIMOD. ""We observe that such extreme events increase in frequency as the climate continues to warm and takes us into unknown territory."" Earth's average surface temperature has risen nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times but high-mountain regions around the world have warmed at twice that pace, climate scientists say. Sikkim is close to India's border with Nepal and China and boasts a sizeable military presence. India has been wary of China's growing military assertiveness and their 3,500-kilometre (2,200-mile) shared frontier has been a perennial source of tension, with parts of Sikkim claimed by Beijing.","['india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'china', 'china', 'china']",us,False,False

Following days of torrential rain in the northeastern state of Sikkim, torrents of water swept down narrow river valleys from Lohnak Lake, in the northern part of the state, damaging a dam and wreaking destruction in villages and Rangpo town, about 50 km (30 miles) south of state capital Gangtok. Rescuers have found 25 bodies in the state and bodies of eight army personnel were found in the neighboring downstream state of West Bengal, Sikkim’s chief secretary Vijay Bhushan Pathak told Reuters. He said 101 people were still missing in the latest of a series of natural disasters caused by extreme weather events in the Himalayas. Fourteen army personnel were among the missing, a defense ministry statement said. The search for survivors was hampered by damaged roads, poor communications and bad weather, and residents were struggling to clear sludge and debris in the wake of one of the worst disasters in the remote region in more than 50 years. Parveen Shama, the top district official of Jalpaiguri in West Bengal, said 41 bodies were found in the district. Sikkim, a Buddhist state of 650,000 people wedged in the mountains between Nepal, Bhutan and China, received 101 millimeters (four inches) of rain in the first five days of October, more than double normal levels. Lhonak Lake is a large glacial bullet-shaped water body that sits at the foot of a melting glacier. An analysis of the images shows more than 60% of the water held in the lake drained out after the extreme rainstorm triggered aglacial lake outburst.This phenomenon happens when a glacial lake rises too high or the surrounding land or ice gives way and the lake bursts, sending water and debris rushing down mountains. Scientists have long studied Lhonak Lake, identifying it as one of the fastest swelling glacial lakes in the region with a high risk for a potential glacial outburst, according tomultiple studies. Mukesh Kumar, a 43-year-old migrant worker in Rangpo, described how he and his neighbors had barely 10 minutes to escape before the flash flood hit. “Had we not left for another two minutes, we might have drowned,” said Kumar, staring at the sludge and debris covering his lodgings. Residents told Reuters that many people whose dwellings were on the ground floor could not have survived. Baiju Sharma, 45, who ran a furniture business, surveyed the aftermath of the disaster. “Where you are standing is 15 feet (4.5 meters) higher than earlier. You are standing on his house,” Sharma said, pointing towards his neighbor. Government officials said about 2,000 tourists stuck in cut off areas of northern Sikkim were reported to be safe, and state authorities and the army had provided them with food and communication facilities to contact their families. Known as the rooftop of the world, the ecologically sensitive Himalayan region is prone to flash floods and landslides, and flooding is not unusual in Sikkim. But scientists are clear that extreme weather is becomingmore frequent and more intenseas the human-caused climate crisis accelerates.

Umesh Ganpat told AFP.“The river stretches up to 86 kilometres,” he added. “The search operation is continuing.”Among the dead are seven Indian army soldiers posted in Sikkim, which sits on India’s remote frontiers with Nepal and China and boasts a sizeable military presence.Sixteen soldiers are among the more than 100 people still missing.Related NewsIndia’s defence ministry said in a statement that the floods had washed away “firearms and explosives” from military camps.The army has “established lookout teams all along the river” to recover loose ordnance, the ministry added.Local media

The lake outburst also resulted in the breach of the Chungthang dam, which is the largest hydropower project in the state. This dam is part of the 1,200-megawatt (MW) Teesta Stage III Hydro Electric Project , in which the state government is the majority stakeholder. Satellite images released by the Hyderabad-based National Remote Sensing Centre showed that the area of south Lhonak lake reduced by over 100 hectares compared to its size on September 17. This suggests that the lake outburst caused a flash flood in the Teesta River basin in north Sikkim. Officials said at least eight people died and 69 more, including 22 army personnel, were missing. Scientists are exploring whether the earthquake that hit Nepal might be a cause of the flash floods in Sikkim. The lake was already vulnerable and covered an area of 168 hectares. Its area has now reduced to 60 hectares, indicating that about 100 hectares of water volume has breached the level, explained a senior official at the Central Water Commission (CWC) to PTI. The official stated that while it's difficult to determine right now, a cloud burst does not cause such results. Some experts who have visited the site believe that the earthquake may have triggered the floods there. The flood alerts were also shared with Bangladesh. The NRSC satellite imagery revealed that the lake covered approximately 162.7 hectares. Its area increased to 167.4 hectares on September 28 but drastically reduced to 60.3 hectares. In this satellite data, it is evident that the lake area has significantly reduced compared to the September 17, 2023, RISAT 1A MRS satellite data, read an NRSC report. The glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in portions of Lhonak Lake, Mangan district, which caused a rapid rise in water levels with very high velocities downstream along the Teesta River Basin in the early hours of October 4, has resulted in severe damage in Mangan, Gangtok, Pakyong, and Namchi districts, the State Disaster Management Authority said. The Chungthang NHPC dam and the bridge were washed away. Two bridges at Minshithang, one bridge at Zema, and Ritchu Bridge , including the Sangkhalang bridge, were washed away, the state government said in a statement. The SDMA's statement highlighted that following the lake outburst, the water level in the rivers rose at a speed of 15 meters per second. The lake outburst caused extensive damage to life and property, including the breakdown of road networks and communication. Several vital bridges connecting to the forward border areas with Sikkim have been washed away due to the flash floods in Mangan, Gangtok, Pakyong, and Namchi districts of Sikkim, according to Sikkim's Chief Secretary Vijay Bhushan Pathak . Arun B Shrestha , senior climate change specialist, the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), said: ""We're facing a devastating flash flood in the Teesta River. Information is fragmented, but it appears heavy rainfall from a Bay of Bengal low-pressure depression triggered the disaster. This seems like another unfortunate example of cascading hazards."" He said that the institute recorded exceedingly high precipitation, exceeding 100 mm within the last 24 hours in the vicinity . Miriam Jackson , senior cryosphere specialist, ICIMOD, said: ""Intense rain has led to this catastrophic situation in Sikkim where the rain has triggered a glacial lake outburst flood and damaged a dam and caused loss of life and caused further damage to roads and infrastructure. We observe that such extreme events increase in frequency as the climate continues to warm and takes us into unknown territory."" Sikkim has 733 glacial lakes, with 288 located above an altitude of 5,000 m, according to NRSC. According to the South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People, south Lhonak lake is a glacial-moraine-dammed lake, located in Sikkim's far northwestern region. It is one of the fastest expanding lakes in the Sikkim Himalaya region, and one of the 14 potentially dangerous lakes susceptible to GLOF. The lake is located at 5,200 m (17,100 ft) above sea level. It formed due to the melting of the Lhonak glacier. The lake is rapidly growing in size in an abnormally rapid manner due to the melting of the lake's associated South Lhonak glacier and additional melt water from the adjacent North Lhonak and main Lhonak glaciers. A study published in the journal Science Direct in 2021 stated that since these lakes are mainly situated in remote and unsettled mountain valleys, GLOFs could claim lives and damage assets tens of kilometers downstream. GLOFs occur when lakes formed by melting glaciers suddenly burst open. This can happen due to various reasons, such as too much water accumulating in the lake or triggers like earthquakes. When the lake bursts, it releases a massive amount of water all at once, causing flash floods downstream. These floods can be very destructive and dangerous to people and the environment in the area. Infrastructure exposed to GLOFs in the Teesta valley suggests that many settlements and assets along the river channel at Chungthang are potentially exposed to future GLOFs. This indicates the need for a comprehensive environmental impact assessment and potential GLOF risk mitigation measures. Some of the largest GLOF events have occurred in the Himalayas, such as the 2013 Chorabari lake outburst, known as the Kedarnath disaster in Uttarakhand. The swelling of the Jhelum river led to Kashmir floods in 2014, and Parechu river flash floods occurred in Himachal Pradesh in 2005. The Kedarnath disaster, caused by a multi-day cloudburst between June 16-17, 2013, became India's worst natural disaster since the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. The combination of melting from the Chorabari glacier and the eruption of the Mandakini river blocked the rivers, causing major overflow. More than 5,700 people were presumed dead. Destruction of bridges and roads trapped around 300,000 pilgrims and tourists in the valleys leading to three of the four Hindu Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites. A flash flood in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district on 7 February 2021 ravaged through the valleys of the Rishi Ganga, Dhauliganga and Alaknanda rivers, swept away the unfinished Tapovan Vishnugad Hydropower Project and inflicted substantial damage on the Rishi Ganga Hydropower Project. A study published in the journal Nature earlier this year stated that 15 million people worldwide are exposed to potential GLOF impacts. Populations in High Mountains Asia (HMA) are the most exposed, living closest to glacial lakes, with one million people living within 10 km of a glacial lake. More than half of the globally exposed population is found in just four countries: India, Pakistan, Peru, and China.

But this, too, is causing new problems, including waterlogged fields and loss of soil fertility.Across the globe, a ""climate adaptation industry"" sometimesimposes solutions that exacerbate the problemsthey aim to solve. Frequently, this comes at the cost of vulnerable communities.This storyplays out across the world, including in Aotearoa New Zealand, where top-down adaptation projects can increase climate vulnerability of communities. Our work seeks to fill a critical gap by establishing amonitoring and evaluation systemto identify the risk of maladaption.Maladaptation is a growing problemConcern about unforeseen consequences of climate adaptation has emerged as akey issue in the latest reportby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Authorsnotedthat:""Evidence of maladaptation is increasing in some sectors and systems, highlighting how inappropriate responses to climate change create long-term lock-in of vulnerability, exposure and risks that are difficult and costly to change and exacerbate existing inequalities for Indigenous peoples andvulnerable groups.""Maladaptation is usually understood as referring to the unintended consequences of well-meant measures to reduce climate vulnerability. But it also includes the fallout from decisions thatfavor technical fixesovermore holistic approaches.Climate adaptation isnot a neutral or apolitical process. It can perpetuate problematic approaches, including colonial land practices and the exclusion of Indigenous voices.This can createtenuous resource distribution,erode democratic governanceandcompromise Indigenous sovereignty, exacerbating vulnerabilities. It can alsosubvert community-driven bottom-up adaptation, instead focusing on national agendas caught up ininternational politics.Addressing these maladaptive strategies is pivotal for achieving climate justice.The situation in Aotearoa New ZealandIn New Zealand, climate change adaptation researchis still in its early stages.Most adaptation projects are being designed and implemented in three key categories: flood protection (stop banks and erosion control), nature-based solutions (tree plantings and wetland restoration) and coastal hazard prevention (managed retreat and sea walls).These efforts often follow a framework of ""dynamic adaptation policy pathways"" (DAPP). This means the planning process has to remain flexible to keep adjusting as new information comes to hand.However, a recentsymposiumon the ten-year stocktake of this approach raised several critical points, including:the need to involve Māori andlocal communitiesmore throughout the processshare governance across all levels of governmentaddress funding barriers for implementationand avoid investments that lock in problems for the future.Take for instance the stalledClifton to Tangoio coastal hazards strategyin the Hawke's Bay. This project aimed to identify the areas most at risk of coastal flooding and erosion.It washindered by policy ambiguity and funding issues. The region now faces decisions about managed retreat because land was classified as uninhabitable after Cyclone Gabrielle.Others have noted the lack of synergy between planned and community-driven climate adaptation activities. Council-planned measuresoften exacerbated climate vulnerability, especially for communities already living in disadvantaged areas.Addressing maladaptationWe came together as a group of Māori, Pasifika, Pākehā andtauiwischolars and practitioners to develop amaladaptation assessment toolfor New Zealand.Its aim is genuine sustainability and justice. It evaluates the risk of maladaptation and serves as the foundation for a national monitoring system with both regulatory and educational roles.Our goals are to illuminate and ideally correct overlooked social and ecological impacts of climate adaptation and to address the limitations of current audit systems. These often neglect local justice and well-being concerns in favor of centrally planned projects aimed at reducing risks identified by engineering and insurance industries.Our preliminary findings from the analysis of 79 adaptation projects show that managed retreat, structuralflood protectionand climate-resilient development projects are most at risk of maladaptation.To be just, climate adaptation requires a counter-intuitive approach. It should prioritize community well-being and examine the risks posed by both climate change and adaptation.This perspective doesn't diminish the reality of climate impacts. It contextualizes them within a complex history ofIndigenous displacement,forced landscape alterationand ongoing social crises.By addressing the threat of maladaptation, we hope to encourage thinking and planning that looksbeyond mere technological fixesand begins to repair our broken relationships with the planet and each other.","['unitedstates', 'fiji', 'bangladesh', 'newzealand', 'newzealand']",gb,False,False

More than 33 million people were directly affected, with a staggering 20.6 million requiring urgent humanitarian assistance. The consequences were dire – nearly eight million people were displaced and at least two million houses destroyed. Although the water has receded, a year later, the scars of the catastrophe remain fresh. At least 1.5 million people are still displaced. Basic necessities, such as food and shelter, continue to be out of reach for a large portion of the flood-affected population, with more than 40 percent of them relying on humanitarian aid for survival. While the immediate concerns of food, shelter and water have been largely addressed, climate anxiety among the flood-affected communities across Pakistan has failed to make headlines. Although climate anxiety is a newly coined term, it reflects a distress that has long been felt by these communities. Amid the increasing threat of climate change, floods in Pakistan have grown more frequent, resulting in some communities facing an unending cycle of displacement and despair. For these communities, the fatigue caused by climate-induced disasters has begun to take its toll. They are not only exhausted but also more anxious than ever about the potential threat of cascading disasters. Residents in these flood-affected areas are living in fear of an uncertain future. They grapple with the harsh reality that they lack the necessary preparations to face another flood, and they have no clear plans for shelter should their already fragile homes become uninhabitable. Despite contributing very little to the global climate crisis, Pakistan remains one of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. And climate anxiety will likely continue to rise in the country, especially among the most vulnerable populations.

Published … [+6072 chars]",Pakistan,"A new study by researchers at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory looks at some of the influences that could be driving the increasingly severe weather over Pakistan.Published innpj Climate and Atmospheric Science,the studyanalyzed more than 40 years of data and found that natural climatevariability, which includes factors such assea surface temperatureand jet stream anomalies, accounts for over 70% of observed monsoon variability and extremes in Pakistan during the 21st century—withclimate changepotentially adding to their severity.Pakistan is no stranger to floods and droughts. However, these events have become more frequent and severe in recent decades—unprecedented rainfall in 2010 and 2022 caused catastrophic floods and landslides, and a drought at the beginning of the 21st century caused widespread famine.Climate scientists must quantify the influence of natural climate variability on theseextreme weather eventsto understand how and the extent to which climate change has contributed to this increased volatility.The study, titled ""The influence of natural variability on extreme monsoons in Pakistan,"" focused on precipitation variability in West South Asia, a region that includes Pakistan and parts of India. The South Asian climate is commonly studied due to the area's high population and strong monsoon season, which can bring up to 70% of the annual rainfall in a few months.The region is strongly affected by the pattern of sea temperature changes in the Pacific Ocean known as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. However, the areas of Pakistan most recently impacted by extreme monsoons typically receive very little rain during the summer, as rain-producing low-pressure systems dissipate by the time they reach the region. The severity of monsoon flooding in Pakistan in 2010 and 2022 suggests that extraordinary atmospheric conditions beyond ENSO have influenced recent weather patterns.""We know that floods and droughts occur naturally in this region,"" said Moetasim Ashfaq, a computational climatologist at ORNL and lead author of the study. ""Our motivation was to understand what is causing the change in their intensity. Is it natural variability or climate change or both?""Visualization of specific humidity (0.0123 KgKg-1) in the atmosphere colored by zonal winds. The strongest colors represent magnitudes greater than ± 10 m/sec. Warm (cold) colors represent eastward (westward) flow. The animation runs from July 1 to Aug. 31, 2022. The convergence zone of the winds represents the position of the monsoon trough. Credit: Moetasim AshfaqTo explore this question, the research team analyzed detrended monthly monsoon precipitation data from West South Asia as well as global land and ocean surface temperatures. Detrending removes large data trends, such as those driven by increasing global temperatures, that may obscure additional factors contributing to changing cyclical patterns.The team's analysis identified a combination of oceanic and atmospheric factors that impact the precipitation in Pakistan—including ENSO andsea surface temperaturesin the western Pacific and northern Arabian Sea—and internal atmospheric variability related to jet stream meandering, which is largely responsible for weather systems moving farther west over Pakistan.The analysis showed that the influence of these climate factors has increased during the 21st century, which Ashfaq suggests is due to their increased strength, simultaneous occurrence (called co-occurrence) or a combination of both.The co-occurrence of forcings has a particularly strong influence on precipitation variability, Ashfaq said. For example, when a moderate ENSO occurs with other forcings, such as jet stream meandering, it can impact precipitation in West South Asia more significantly than when it occurs alone. This phenomenon could explain why ENSO was more influential during the 2010 and 2022 flooding events.Althoughnatural climate variabilitycan explain more than 70% of the precipitation variability over Pakistan, Ashfaq explained that climate change may still play an indirect role. The increased variabilities in jet stream and sea surface temperatures and co-occurrence of multiple forcings may be caused by climate change. Additionally, more atmospheric moisture caused by warmerglobal temperaturescan lead to heavier rainfall, especially when combined with other dynamic forcings. However, further research is necessary to fully understand theimpact of climate changeon monsoons in Pakistan.""The link between climate change and extreme weather should be carefully evaluated,"" Ashfaq said. ""Climate change may have an indirect role in shaping the changes in the characteristics of identified forcings, but they're all part of naturally occurring variability in the atmosphere and the oceans.""Some of the identified mechanisms related to the internal atmospheric variability that influences monsoon extremes over Pakistan are less predictable, so forecasts of such events may be limited, Ashfaq said. For example, seasonal forecasting systems predicted above-normal monsoon rains over West South Asia for 2022, but the actual rainfall significantly exceeded the predicted amounts. Nevertheless, the insights into the natural climate drivers that impact summer precipitation at the western margins of the South Asian monsoon region could help future investigations of surrounding regions and the development of better predictive models.","['pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'india']",gb,False,False

Damages to crops, infrastructure, industry, and livelihoods were estimated at $30 billion.In response to this, Stanford researchers from the Natural Capital Project (NatCap) and the Carnegie Institution for Science collaborated on a new way to quickly calculate the approximate depths of flooding in different areas and number of people affected.Their analysisoffers insights into potential options and costs for incorporating adaptation to future floods into rebuilding efforts, and shows that climate adaptation measures like these could have helped most, if not all, of the people affected by the flood.""With events of this scale, it's very poorly understood what the costs of climate adaptation would be,"" said Rafael Schmitt, lead author of the paper, published Oct. 25 inEnvironmental Research Letters, and a lead scientist with NatCap. He noted thatclimate adaptationhas been a second priority behind climate mitigation—a trend now called the adaptation gap. But clearly, climate change is here now.""We were motivated by these big floods that are happening now every year, to ask: How can we conduct a very high-level assessment of what it would cost to adapt livelihoods to a changing climate? This could help countries and international donors evaluate the cost-effectiveness of specific adaptation measures,"" Schmitt added, noting the default is often to build back to the status quo, resulting in lack of preparedness for future floods, much as rebuilding from Pakistan floods in 2010 did.A new climate adaptation decision-support toolThe researchers addressed two main options for adapting to future flooding in Pakistan, both of which have been widely implemented across Asia: ""moving up"" by building elevated structures, or ""moving over"" by temporarily relocating when floods occur. The depth of flooding—and how far away dry land is—areimportant factorsfor determining which response makes sense.Locations with shallow flood depths that are far from dry land would favor elevating buildings, while flood depths of greater than two meters make elevated structures impractical and too costly, based on experiences in nearby Bangladesh. Yet flood stage information (i.e., flood depth or severity) to help make this determination has been hard to come by.The team brought togethersatellite dataon where flooding occurred, which are readily available in nearlyreal-time; ground elevation data combined with simplified hydrologic principles (e.g., water flows downhill) to reveal depth; anddemographic dataon population density, housing, and other infrastructure. This produced their ""Floodplain Adaptation Strategies Testbed"" or ""FAST,"" a rapid overview of flood severity and exposure that shows how deep the flooding was in different locations, and how many people were exposed to those depths.Through FAST, the researchers estimated that 26.6 million people in Pakistan were exposed to low water levels (less than 1 meter), 7.4 million people were exposed to water levels between 1 and 2 meters, and 5.7 million people were exposed to more than 2 meters of flooding. Based on this and proximity to dry land, there were 27.5 million people in the ""move up or over"" category (in other words, either strategy could work), 5.1 million people in the ""move over"" category, 6.3 million people in the ""move up"" category, and half a million people in the retreat category (where the flood depths were greater than 2 meters and they're far from dry land).Focusing on the 7.4 million people who experienced 1-2 meters offlooddepth, the analysis estimated adaptation costs between $1.5–$3.6 billion, in addition to the $5.8 billion to rebuild housing to the status quo.Prioritizing equity and resilience in rebuilding effortsThis version of FAST looked only at housing but it could also be applied to other types of infrastructure, such as roads, schools, and hospitals. And in the future, its analyses could become even more detailed because of a new, more advanced NASA Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite, or SWOT.The researchers also recognize that there are other adaptation options besides ""moving up or moving over."" For example, local water agencies often rely on dikes, levees, and other ""hard"" infrastructure—which the researchers warn can promote development in areas prone to flooding, increasing the risk of catastrophic damages if infrastructure fails. Whatever the mix of responses is, FAST could help provide information, but it must be checked to see whether and how these options meet actual community needs.Without analyses like FAST, reconstruction funding can often be directed to those with the greatest influence, who perhaps need the least support.""The study speaks to the potential to incorporate science-informed adaptation measures into reconstruction and disaster response, helping in investment prioritization. This is particularly useful nowadays with the discussions on mechanisms to compensate countries of the Global South for climate-change-attributed damages,"" said Edgar Virgüez, postdoctoral research scientist and deputy group leader at the Carnegie Department of Global Ecology at Stanford and a co-author of the study. The FAST tool could offer a more data-driven and equitable approach to prioritization.""Countries of the Global South, like my native Colombia, would benefit from process-based model assessments at scale and in a timely manner that can guide the investments of scarce resources. Especially since many of these countries lack timely-generated data, which complicates strategic decision investments,"" said Virgüez.An important outcome of the United Nations Climate Conference last year (COP27) was a new Loss and Damage Fund to provide financial support for countries that are most vulnerable to climate change. In this paper, the team urged funders and governments to rebuild with adaptation in mind. To do that, they say, more science should also be directed toward understanding low-cost adaptation options.""Flood models are data-intensive, and you need specialized knowledge to run them,"" said Schmitt. ""We need adaptation research that is easier to use and act on. FAST is a step toward that goal.""","['pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'bangladesh', 'colombia']",gb,False,False

More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm. Some children, like 10-year-old Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim, are already on the move. Her family left their home in Somalia after dawn prayers on a Saturday morning five months ago. The worst drought in more than 50 years scorched the once-fertile pastures the family relied on, leaving them barren. So, bundling only a few clothes and some utensils into sacks, they moved to a camp in the capital Mogadishu, where Ibrahim, who dreams of being a doctor, is now going to school for the first time. That’s a plus, but the camp lacks proper shelter and sanitation, and food is scarce. “We need something that can protect us from the heat during the day and the cold at night,” Ibrahim said. Read more:U.N. Climate Warning Also Comes With Clear Steps To Cut Emissions The miseries of long, drawn-out disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report — more than half of them in Somalia — but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no pre-emptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide,climate changehas already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines; storms are battering megacities and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. “The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in (the) future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify,” said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the report's authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 2016-21 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. Floods displaced children more than 19 million times in places like India and China. Wildfires impacted children 810,000 times in the U.S. and Canada. Data tracking migrations because of weather extremes typically don't differentiate between children and adults. UNICEF worked with a Geneva-based nonprofit, the International Displacement Monitoring Center, to map where kids were most impacted. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. Those countries also have vast populations and strong systems to evacuate people, which makes it easier for them to record data. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring “overlapping crises” — where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. During unprecedented flooding of the Yamuna River in July in the Indian capital New Delhi, churning waters washed away the hut that was home to 10-year-old Garima Kumar’s family. The waters also took her school uniform and her school books. Kumar lived with her family on sidewalks of the megacity and missed a month of school. “Other students in the school teased me because my house had been flooded. Because we don’t have a permanent home,” Kumar said. The floodwaters have receded and the family began repairing their home last month — a process Garima’s mother Meera Devi said they are having to do over and over again as floods are becoming more common. Her father, Shiv Kumar, hasn’t had any work for over a month. The family's only income is the mother’s $2 daily earnings as a domestic helper. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnam-based expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasn’t involved with the report. “When you’re desperate, you do things that you normally wouldn’t do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they don’t have the ability to stand up for themselves,” she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become “shock-responsive, portable and inclusive,” to help children and their families better cope with disasters. This would mean considering children’s needs at different stages, from ensuring they have opportunities to study, that they can stay with their families and that eventually they can find work. “We have the tools. We have the knowledge. But we’re just not working fast enough,” Healy said.","['somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'philippines', 'philippines', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'china', 'china', 'us', 'canada', 'switzerland', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'vietnam', 'vietnam', 'bangladesh']",us,True,False

Hong Kong has closed schools and suspended trading on the stock exchange after a weakening Typhoon Koinu brought torrential rain and storm-force winds to the southern Chinese territory. More than 150mm of rain was recorded over most parts of Hong Kong from midnight into Monday morning, with rainfall exceeding 300mm in some areas, data showed. The Hong Kong Observatory issued a “black” rainstorm warning – its highest – for about six hours before it was downgraded at 10.30am (02:30 GMT), a month after the city was paralysed by theworst floods in 140 years. While Koinu, which killed one person in Taiwan last week, had weakened into a severe tropical storm, it still brought significant disruption. Schools and childcare centres were ordered to shut and the morning session at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was suspended. Trade was expected to resume at 2pm (06:00 GMT). Hundreds of passengers were stranded at Hong Kong’s airport overnight and underground metro stations as Koinu disrupted flights and transport, public broadcaster RTHK reported. In early September, Hong Kong was brought to a standstill by torrential rain that swamped streets andflooded shopping malls and metro stations. A “black” warning was also issued then. In China’s Guangdong province – where Koinu is expected to sweep past en route to Hainan island – the cities of Zhuhai and Jiangmen issued a Level III emergency response, according to the Xinhua news agency on Sunday. The alert meant more than 35,500 fishing boats had to return to port, while dozens of coastal scenic areas were temporarily closed. Southern China is frequently hit during the summer and autumn seasons by typhoons that form in the warm oceans east of the Philippines and then travel west. But climate change has made tropical storms more unpredictable while increasing their intensity – bringing more rain and stronger gusts that lead to flash floods and coastal damage, experts say.

The associated hurricane force winds are gradually departing from the seas south of Hong Kong,"" said the observatory, issuing a map that showed Koinu's path headed directly for China's island province of Hainan.It was about 70 kilometers (43 miles) south-southwest of Hong Kong around midnight and was forecast to edge closer to the western part of the Pearl River Estuary.Despite the storm downgrade to ""T8""—which will be in place until 11 am Monday—the observatory warned the public ""precautions should not yet be relaxed"", and said the gales generated by Koinu were expected to persist.The ""T8"" warning level is triggered when a storm's maximum sustained wind speed reaches 117 kilometers (72 miles) per hour.

More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released on Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm. The miseries of long, drawn-out disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report — more than half of them in Somalia — but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no pre-emptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide, climate change has already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines; storms are battering cities, and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. “The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in (the) future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify,” said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the report's authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 2016-21 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring “overlapping crises” — where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnam-based expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasn’t involved with the report. “When you’re desperate, you do things that you normally wouldn’t do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they don’t have the ability to stand up for themselves,” she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become “shock-responsive, portable and inclusive,” to help children and their families better cope with disasters. This would mean considering children’s needs at different stages, from ensuring they have opportunities to study, that they can stay with their families and that eventually they can find work. “We have the tools. We have the knowledge. But we’re just not working fast enough,” Healy said.","['somalia', 'philippines', 'philippines', 'india', 'india', 'china', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'vietnam', 'vietnam', 'bangladesh']",eu,False,False

That works out to 20,000 children displaced every single day due to extreme weather fueled by climate change. The researchers found that floods and storms caused 95% of all child displacements recorded, with the rest due to drought and wildfires. “It is terrifying for any child when a ferocious wildfire, storm or flood barrels into their community,” said UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell, in a statement. Thereportis the first of its kind, according to UNICEF. “Until now, children displaced by weather-related events have been statistically invisible,” the organization said in a statement. East Asia and the Pacific have been particularly affected. In 2020,Cyclone Amphanled to 1.5 million child displacements across India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Bhutan. In 2021,Typhoon Raicaused 1.5 million child displacements across the Philippines, Palau and Vietnam. By overall numbers of displacements, three countries dominated: the Philippines, India and China, where a total of 23 million children were forced from their homes and schools across the six-year period. The location and geography of these countries make them prone to floods and storms, which are set to worsen as the climate crisis intensifies. However, the report noted that all three countries implement preemptive evacuation plans, meaning children can be moved before a disaster hits, which may account for the higher numbers of displacements. A different picture emerges when looking at the number of children displaced relative to the size of each country’s population. Storms in the small Caribbean island country of Dominica, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017, displaced 76% of the child population over the six-year period. South Sudan and Somalia experienced the highest proportion of child displacement from flooding, with 11% and 12% of children having to flee their homes, the report found. Both countries implement far fewer evacuation plans, making children even more vulnerable, according to the report. Meanwhile drought, particularly in Somalia, Ethiopia and Afghanistan has contributed to over 1.3 million children having to leave their homes. However these statistics are likely to be conservative, as there is less data available for slow-onset disasters like drought, the reported noted. Wildfires in the US and Canada have also led to child displacement, and they are likely to cause larger-scale displacements in the future, the report found. “For those who are forced to flee, the fear and impact can be especially devastating, with worry of whether they will return home, resume school, or be forced to move again. Moving may have saved their lives, but it’s also very disruptive,” UNICEF’s Russell said. Whether short-lived or long-term, displacement can amplify risks of exploitation, child trafficking and abuse, while also exposing children to malnutrition, disease and inadequate immunization, the report found. The situation is poised to get worse. As the human-caused climate crisis accelerates, extreme weather is becoming more severe and more common. With every additional 1 degree Celsius of warming, the global risks of displacement from flooding are projected to rise by 50%, according to research cited in the report. “We have the tools and knowledge to respond to this escalating challenge for children, but we are acting far too slowly,” Russell said.","['india', 'india', 'bangladesh', 'myanmar', 'bhutan', 'philippines', 'philippines', 'palau', 'vietnam', 'china', 'dominica', 'southsudan', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'ethiopia', 'afghanistan', 'us', 'canada']",us,True,False

By Subel Rai Bhandari for RFA 2023.10.06 -- More than 43 million children were internally displaced over six years due to climate change-exacerbated, weather-related disasters, with China, India and the Philippines leading the chart in absolute numbers, a U.N. agency said in a new report. ""While the link between climate change and displacement is complex, it's clearer than ever that the climate is shifting patterns of displacement,"" UNICEF said Friday in a statement, releasing the report, ""Children displaced in a changing climate."" Between 2016 and 2021, the U.N. Children's Fund said 43.1 million youngsters - or about 20,000 child displacements a day - across 44 countries were displaced in the most common weather-related hazards, including floods, storms, droughts and wildfires. Floods and storms drove 95% of recorded child displacements. It was unclear how many of the 43 million children were, in fact, preemptive evacuees, as opposed to displaced for the short or long term. ""It is terrifying for any child when a ferocious wildfire, storm or flood barrels into their community,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. ""For those who are forced to flee, the fear and impact can be especially devastating, with worry of whether they will return home, resume school, or be forced to move again. Moving may have saved their lives, but it's also very disruptive."" ""As the impacts of climate change escalate, so too will climate-driven movement."" The report said 9.7 million child displacements in the Philippines alone, 6.7 million in India, and 6.4 million in China were due to all four hazards combined. The numbers were high due to geographic locations, exposure to extreme weather, large child populations, and progress made on early warning and evacuation capacities. Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Vietnam came fourth, eighth, and ninth in the top-10 ranking based on absolute numbers, with 3.3 million, 960,000, and 930,000 children respectively displaced between 2016 and 2021. Relative to the size of their child population, Dominica (76%) experienced the largest number of child displacements from all four disasters. The list included Vanuatu, the Philippines, and Fiji. Between 2016 and 2021, floods displaced roughly 19.7 million children globally. India (3.9 million), China (3.7 million), and the Philippines (1.3 million) were hardest hit. Similarly, storms led to the displacement of about 21 million children, with the highest numbers in the Philippines (8.3 million), India (2.8 million) and China (2.6 million). Asia and the Pacific frequently experience storms, leading to mass evacuations. In 2020, Cyclone Amphan displaced 1.5 million children in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Bhutan, while Typhoon Rai (Odette) displaced 1.5 million children in the Philippines, Palau, and Vietnam in 2021. Droughts caused over 1.3 million child displacements in 15 countries, with 730,000 in Somalia, 340,000 in Ethiopia, and 190,000 in Afghanistan. Wildfires, which primarily affected the Americas, displaced 810,000 children between 2016 and 2021, with the United States, Canada, and Israel seeing the highest child displacements at 610,000, 47,000, and 31,000, respectively. Using a disaster displacement risk model, the UNICEF report predicted that riverine floods may displace an average of 3.2 million children annually, totaling 96 million over 30 years. Cyclonic winds follow, potentially displacing over 10.3 million children, while storm surges might account for 7.2 million displacements in the same three-decade span. ""Given their large population, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Philippines and China are the five countries with the most predicted future displacements of children owing to all hazards combined (riverine flood, cyclones and storm surges),"" the report said.

Yes, they're surrounded by oozing mud.But looks can be deceiving. These remarkable shrubs and trees are nurseries for many species of fish, shellfish and crabs. They protect our coastlines from erosion, storm surges, wind and floods. And that mud? It's one of the best biological ways we know of to store carbon.Theseecosystem servicesare extremely valuable—but people often don't notice what they offer until they're lost to aquaculture, firewood or settlement.Conservingmangrovesby declaring parks and other protected areas seems like a logical solution. But often, nations can see protected areas as a cost, walling them off from human use, and ignoring their benefits to people.What ournew research showsis that you don't have to choose between nature and humans. Protecting mangroves offers a win-win, given how valuable they are to coastal communities, fishers and the fight against climate change.As nations aim to conserve 30% of their lands and waters by decade's end, those lucky enough to have mangroves should look to their coasts.Why are mangroves so important?Mangroves thrive on the coast, poised between land and sea. They first evolved between 100 million and 65 million years ago. Each of the 65 species of mangrove is a shrub or tree which has, over time, evolved to live in salt or brackish water.These trees are extremely resilient, surviving in brackish water and low-oxygen conditions, which would kill other trees. To survive, they've acquired adaptations such as aerial roots that can take in oxygen. These tangled roots make excellent hiding places for the creatures of land and sea, including mudskipper fish able to survive out of water.Aerial roots let these trees and shrubs exchange gases with the atmosphere when the soil is waterlogged. Credit: Alvise DabalàTheir complex roots are ideal nurseries for juvenile fish, crabs and prawns by providing shelter and places to feed. In turn, these nurseries keep populations healthy, sustaining commercial fisheries as well as direct sources of protein for coastal people.Their robust tangles of roots protect them from the force of waves, storm surges and wind. In turn, this helps people, who can shelter behind this green wall, protecting our homes.Mangroves also act as a natural way to tackle climate change. Their roots trap sediment, burying inorganic and organic carbon in the process. They also store carbon in their biomass. Overall, these sea forestsstore carbonat almost three times the rate of tropical rainforests, twice that of peat swamps, and almost seven times the rate of seagrasses.Protecting mangroves needs a different approachWhile mangroves give us a host of benefits, many of these only become apparent when these ecosystems are gone.Unfortunately, mangroves are often cleared to make way for aquaculture, farming and human settlements, or for firewood. An estimated 20–35% of the world's mangroveshave been lost since 1980. In better news, losses have declined significantly. We now lose around0.13% per year.Protected areas work well as a way to cut mangrove losses. When a government sets out to create these areas, the aim is usually to protect biodiversity while minimizing conflict with human use.In our research, we found the world's network of protected areas isn't doing a great job in protecting either mangrove biodiversity or the ecosystem benefits mangroves give us. In fact, it's no better than just picking areas at random.That means high-priority mangrove forests important for both biodiversity and ecosystem services are not being properly conserved. Clever expansion of the current network could solve the problem. At present, parks and other protected areas cover about 13% of the world's mangrove forests, which are clustered around the tropics.Mangrove forest in Karimunjawa, Indonesia. Credit: Alvise DabalàBoosting this to 30%—in line with the biodiversity conservation target agreed to by196 nations last year—would reap benefits. Our research suggests it would safeguard houses and infrastructure worth A$25.6 billion, protect six million people against coastal flooding, and store over one billion extra tons of carbon. Also, fishers would gain an extra 50 million days of successful fishing a year.Even better—we found optimizing conservation of both biodiversity and ecosystem services needed only 3–9% more area protected compared to mangrove protection areas based on saving species alone.Protect mangroves in Asia and OceaniaMangrove forests urgently needing protection are almost all in Asia (63% of the total) and Oceania (17%), where we find large biodiverse mangrove forests which support fishing industries and many coastal communities.Indonesia is a particular hotspot, given its 17,000-odd islands are often ringed by mangroves. Mangroves in India, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea also need better protection.Australia does reasonably well. Around 18% of our mangroves are protected, above the global average of 13.5%. Over 20% of the areas we have flagged are high-priority for mangrove conservation are already protected. Even so, expanding the protected area network would be a good move, as Australian mangroves are some of the world's most biodiverse and carbon-rich.Mangroves in parts of northern Queensland need better protection. Some mangroves are already protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Reserve, but there are still large unprotected tracts.Mangroves around Darwin and Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory need expanded protected areas, as do those on the coast between the Pilbara and the Kimberley in Western Australia.Too often, protecting nature is seen as a cost to society. What our modeling shows is that we can have a win-win. By protecting the most precious areas ofmangrove, we can protect human communities and wider biodiversity at a stroke.","['indonesia', 'indonesia', 'indonesia', 'india', 'vietnam', 'papuanewguinea', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia']",gb,False,False

The cumulative cost of these events exceeds $2.630 trillion.Other notable highlights from this report for SeptemberPersistent heat brought record-breaking temperatures in parts of the nationIt was the warmest September on record for Texas by nearly 0.3 of a degree F, and New Mexico tied 2015 and 2019 for its warmest September on record.A total of 111 counties had their warmest September on record, while an additional 582 counties ranked in the top-10 warmest for the month. There are 3,143 counties in the U.S.High temperatures and lack of rainfall resulted in persistent drought across parts of the Midwest, leading to near-record low water levels along parts of the Mississippi River and creating saltwater intrusion concerns in southern Louisiana.Record-high temperatures persisted across much of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands last month. San Juan recorded its warmest September and warmest month on record, while St. Croix's Rohlsen Airport saw its warmest September on record.Several notable storms impacted portions of the U.S.September 14-16: Hurricane Lee brought catastrophic flash flooding and damage to portions of New England.September 23: Tropical Storm Ophelia made landfall in eastern North Carolina and moved northward along the East Coast. Ophelia broughtheavy rainfalland flooding from North Carolina to Massachusetts, resulting in significant damage and power outages.September 24-26: A bomb cyclone broughtheavy precipitationto much of the Pacific Northwest, with Seattle seeing three of its five wettest days so far this year.September 29: A slow-moving storm brought heavy rainfall to New York City, grounding flights, flooding roads and subways and trapping residents in their homes. Parts of Brooklyn reported more than 7 inches of rainfall, while John F. Kennedy Airport received 8.65 inches—setting a new 24-hour precipitationrecordfor the month which was previously set by Hurricane Donna in 1960.Provided byNOAA HeadquartersCitation: Report: The US just had its seventh-warmest September on record (2023, October 11) retrieved 3 November 2023 ","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'puertorico']",gb,True,False

Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston on Sept. 20.Chloe Veltman/NPRhide caption Conservation professionals learn how to respond to cultural heritage emergencies following disasters at the John F. 20. La Casa del Libro Museum Libraryin San Juan was among the many cultural institutions to suffer devastating consequences after hurricanes Irma and Maria walloped Puerto Rico in 2017. Human-driven climate change was the engine behind both. Strong winds caused the museum's power to go out. This meant no air conditioning. And the high humidity levels threatened the museum's world-class collection of 15th century books and artworks with mold. About a month after disaster struck, the institution put out a call to theNational Heritage Responders Hotlinefor help. The National Heritage Responders is a volunteer network of around 100 experts in cultural heritage conservation from around the country. They assist individuals and institutions in figuring out how to save important objects and buildings after disasters. Individuals, if your personal items have been damaged in an emergency, email:NHRpublichelpline@culturalheritage.org Institutions, if your collections have been affected by an emergency, call: 202-661-8068, or, if it's not urgent emailemergencies@culturalheritage.org Their crisis hotline has been busier than ever in recent years because of more frequent and severe weather brought on by climate change. In 2023, there have been around 70 calls so far, up from fewer than 10 in 2008, when the hotline first appeared. (The hotline is intended for the use of cultural institutions; individual members of the public can get in touch with the network viaemail.) ""Climate change is increasing the frequency and the severity of the disasters that we're experiencing,"" said Ann Frellsen. The Atlanta-based book and paper conservator is a longtime heritage responder volunteer with more than three decades of experience helping out cultural institutions after disasters. She was among those deployed to Puerto Rico over several visits starting a couple of months after the hurricanes hit. ""It's just a constant battle."" After providing initial support via the phone, Frellsen and her team came in to help La Casa del Libro and other local institutions in crisis with equipment, supplies and advice. (Much of the advice the hotline provides is via phone or video-chat; volunteers are sent out into the field in certain cases, on an as-needed basis.) In this photo taken Jan. 1, 2018, National Heritage Responders assist at La Casa Del Libro in San Juan, Puerto Rico in the aftermath of hurricanes Irma and Maria. Ann Frellsen is pictured in the black shirt.Karen Cana-Cruzhide caption In this photo taken Jan. Ann Frellsen is pictured in the black shirt. ""There were no stoplights and there were no signs on the highways, because they'd all blown away,"" Frellsen said. Frellsen said figuring out how to reach the more than 20 institutions that needed assistance in Puerto Rico was challenging — and that's to say nothing of theon-the-job hazards. ""As hot and humid as it was, we were in full Tyvek suits the entire time because the mold situation was just unfathomable,"" Frellsen said. ""We don't have a conservator in-house. We weren't prepared,"" said La Casa del Libro's executive director, Karen Cana-Cruz. ""So the assistance of the National Heritage Responders for us was very important, very appreciated."" When she isn't heading into disaster zones to help salvage artifacts and heirlooms from fires, hurricanes and floods, Frellsen trains others in the heritage conservation field to do the same. Recently, she co-led a workshop of professional librarians, archivists and conservators at theJohn F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museumin Boston. Some of the participants may eventually take the test to become National Heritage Responders. But at this moment, they were deep in a hands-on training exercise, based on an imaginary scenario cooked up by Frellsen and her co-trainers. Disaster response training participant Evan Knight peers into a display case containing a ballgown worn by Rosemary Kennedy in 1938.Chloe Veltman/NPRhide caption Disaster response training participant Evan Knight peers into a display case containing a ballgown worn by Rosemary Kennedy in 1938. In the scenario, a blizzard had triggered the museum's sprinkler system — which can happen in strong winds — and all that water has left behind soggy carpets, excess humidity, and many precious presidential artifacts in a World War II exhibition in peril. Huddled around a tall glass case containing a ball-gown worn by John F. Kennedy's sister, Rosemary Kennedy, in 1938, the trainee heritage responders tried to figure out how to protect the gauzy, peach-colored dress — and the other treasures on display — from the ravages of mold. ""I would mitigate the high humidity in the space,"" said Evan Knight, the preservation specialist with Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners, the state agency that supports libraries in Massachusetts. ""And if we deal with the humidity, then that should help at least arrest mold growth to some extent before a conservator can come in."" But Annie Rubel, a historic preservation expert in Deerfield, Mass., wasn't too keen on this idea. ""Well, I think that this is an extremely fragile piece,"" Rubel countered. ""If there is no textile conservator on the way immediately, I would fashion some kind of support sling and very gently remove it from the area."" Ultimately, they decide to remove the carpet from under the case and stabilize the environment in the case itself. The National Heritage Responders was launched by theFoundation for Advancement in Conservationin 2006. But it was in the 1940s that the United States and Europe first started thinking seriously about how to recover culturally important artifacts and sites after a crisis. World War II compelled countries to band together to protect cultural treasures, forming a group of 345 men and women from 13 countries known asThe Monuments Men. Since then, efforts around saving cultural heritage after disasters have evolved beyond historic buildings and celebrated works of art. For example, after floods devastated Eastern Kentucky in 2022, National Heritage Responders helped salvage thousands of reel-to-reel tapes documenting Appalachian cultural traditions. They also recently ran online workshops on disaster recovery for people in Maui following this summer's wildfires. ""A community can't recover if they lose those cultural identities,"" said Frellsen, ""and their cultural identity is often tied up in the objects and the spaces that they live with."" Frellsen said she's excited about the next generation that she's training — especially with human-caused climate change creating a lot more work. ""It's really comforting to know that there are a lot more people who can come in and replace us, with a lot more stamina and energy than I find I have,"" she said. ""I would really love to be deployed,"" said Rubel, the preservation expert who attended the training in Boston. Rubel said she hopes her background in building conservation will secure her a spot in the National Heritage Responders' network. ""That's an underrepresented skillset on the team,"" Rubel said. ""So I'm hoping that that comes up sooner rather than later."" Audio and digital story edited byJennifer Vanasco. Audio produced byIsabella Gomez Sarmiento.

American cities are const… [+12570 chars]",Real estate,"American cities are constantly in competition — for people, professional sports teams, headline-grabbing events, and company headquarters. For decades, cities have duked it out for titles like ""best city for business"" or ""healthiest city in America,"" but now they're starting to compete for a new title: best place to ride out dystopia. Every American city has its charms and its flaws. Some boast of great barbecue, while others tout their proximity to sandy beaches. The country's vast size gives American families and businesses a large menu of climates, real-estate markets, andamenities from which to choose. It also forces elected officials to employ a variety of tactics such ascash incentives, infrastructure investments, and tax breaks to win over prospective transplants and fortify their economies. Whether it's Los Angeles scoring the 2028 Olympics, or Austin persuading Tesla to move its headquarters to the city, splashy announcements generate buzz about the winning cities and allow them to sell people on the upside of moving to the area. On the flip side, cities that lose people and jobs are at risk of entering the ""urban doom loop"" — a downward spiral ofdeclining economic vitality, falling tax revenue, and a drop in local public services. Over the past 50 years, the winners of this intercity battle have been the booming metros in theSun Belt. Millions of people have migrated to the US South and West seeking out the sun and cheaper homes. Business has followed: Theheadquarters of Fortune 500 companieshave rapidly shifted away from industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast toward cities like Dallas, Houston, and Atlanta. However, in recent years these onetime winners have started to grapple with a new set of challenges caused by the changing climate:120-degree days in the summer, encroaching flood waters, and the ever present threat of wildfires. The idyllic destinations for Americans seeking a better life are starting to look like precarious long-term bets. While Sun Belt cities are working to mitigate these challenges, the increased risks also create an opportunity for once forgotten cities. Places that previously were in decline such as Buffalo, New York, and Detroit are rolling out a new type of marketing campaign to make the case that they can offer a desirable mix of stable weather, cheap housing, and robust public investment. These ""climate oases"" and ""climate havens"" have been trying to attract newly footloose Americans, freed from the office by the rise of working from home, and lure risk-averse people who are deeply concerned about rising climate risk. While many Americans are still moving into areas facing arising tide of disasters, the country's increasing climate risks have sparked a countermovement of people looking for a safe haven from storms and droughts. A report from the real-estate-data provider CoreLogic found that14.5 million homes in the USwere affected by natural disasters in 2021, and according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the number of disasters causing more than $1 billion in damage has been increasing over the past 10 years. The frequency of these costly catastrophes is making many Americans rethink their living arrangements: 23% of people surveyed ina recent USA Today pollsaid they thought they would eventually be forced to move because of the climate crisis. For Americans living in areas more prone to disasters, the numbers were even higher — 30% of people in the West said they anticipated needing to move eventually. Most of the current climate migration is happening in outlying areas faced with recurring natural disasters. Longtime residents of theFlorida Keys, which have been battered by fierce hurricanes and rising sea levels, are starting to leave their homes. And many residents of rural California are finding it increasingly difficult to purchasehome insurancein fire-prone areas, prompting some to move. But as weather extremes become more pronounced, major metro areas could start to feel some strain. A 2016 study published in the Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists,found that""Americans favor a daily average temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit"" and would generally pay more to avoid excessive heat rather than cold. So as average temperatures start to drift higher around the country, some of the more populated areas in theSouth and West could begin to lose outas people seekrelief from the heat. This opens the door for once beleaguered locales in the Midwest and industrial Northeast to reenter the ring. For decades, cities such as Detroit, Baltimore, and Cincinnati have been on a downward spiral as they lose people and businesses to the sunnier parts of the country. But now the tides are starting to turn in their favor: These cities generally have easy access to plenty of clean water, cooler climates, and less exposure to the coastal hurricanes, forest fires, and flooding that are more frequent in the Sun Belt. Add in relatively cheap homes and a willingness to invest in the types of infrastructure necessary to adapt to our changing planet, and the formerly forgotten parts of the country are starting to look attractive. Take Buffalo. The city's population has since 1970 been on a long, steady decline as its thriving industrial sector was hollowed out. Now, the city's leaders have sensed an opportunity to revitalize the region. Buffalo's natural characteristics provide a good starting point — its high temperature in July of 79 degrees is much cooler than in Phoenix, for instance. And according to data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the city has been hit by only 27 federally declared disasters since 1953. Compare that with the 80 disasters that have hit Los Angeles County and the 41 disasters in Miami-Dade County. Then there's its abundant freshwater from Lake Erie, relatively cheap housing market — Zillowshows that the median home pricein the city was $215,000 as of October — and robust infrastructure from the city's previous life as a manufacturing center. With all that in mind, Buffalo has a chance to stage a serious comeback. Buffalo's leaders have decided to capitalize on these advantages by explicitly painting the city as a safe spot to ride out the county's coming climate upheaval. In a 2019 speech, Mayor Byron Brown said the city would be a ""climate refuge"" for Americans seeking a more stable place to lay down roots and promised to make investments in the city's resiliency. The declaration has been followed up with investments in key areas — climate resilience was one of the four pillars that made up the city's four-year strategic plan released at the start of 2023. As part of the plan, Buffalo's government said it planned to invest in a more resilient localelectricity grid, convert city vehicles and buildings to renewable energy, and invest in emissions-reducing infrastructure such as electric-vehicle charging stations and improved bike lanes. Beyond direct investment, the city also committed to working with private businesses to reduce their climate impact, including financing that allows companies to make energy-efficient upgrades to their facilities on the cheap. While there are many questions about the rollout of the plans, the vocal commitment of Buffalo to make the changes needed to make the city more climate-resilient will likely act as a clarion call for many Americans. Each year, roughly 8 million Americans move to a different state. If 1% of these movers chose Buffalo, this would be an inflow of 80,000 people to a city home to 275,000 people — a massive increase. And Buffalo isn't the only city in the country's industrial belt trying to win over new residents with this sales pitch: Places includingDuluth, Minnesota;Grand Rapids, Michigan; and evenChicagoare also making a bid for free-moving and climate-concerned workers. Climate competition is still just one aspect of the battle between cities. Other factors, such as schools, crime, and job availability, are also crucial to developing the image as an up-and-coming place to move. Many of the cities that are trying to offer themselves to ""climate refugees"" have struggled with one or more of these elements in the recent past — but there is hope here. Households and individuals are able to make an informed decision about where to live based on a wealth of data, on things including home prices, graduation rates for public schools, and job openings. For concerns such as crime, theFBI has a tool on its websiteto allow people to compare data for different cities and states across the country. As we start to learn more about the emerging climate risks to various parts of the country, the US government can play a similar role in providing city-level data including recent temperature by month, air pollution, natural-disaster damage, and rainfall. The real-estate firmRedfinhas partnered with the nonprofit First Street Foundation to provide property-level report cards on fire, flood, and heat risk to people searching for housing. My ongoing research highlights that homebuyers in both red states and blue states have begun to make decisions based on this information, weighing it as a factor in where they choose to move. As extreme weather events occur, people looking for a new home will be able to evaluate how many people died or lost their homes in any given city because of the climate crisis. The most climate-resilient cities will become the clear winners. And if cities such as Buffalo and Detroit invested in infrastructure — from new roads and renewable-power plants to entertainment districts and improved schools — to support movers, this would act as a self-reinforcing economic cycle that could enhance their natural weather advantages. As the population grows, new restaurants and cultural opportunities will pop up. Home prices will grow, creating local wealth and economic development. And the spending on activities and housing will boost local tax revenues and provide cities a chance to reinvest in core services — the opposite of the ""doom loop."" But public-sector investment alone won't go very far without the innovation of the private sector. Northern and Midwestern states will need a strong private-sector presence to meet the ever evolving demands that the climate crisis and a wave of new residents will bring. Here, too, there are hopeful examples. In the recent past, the city of Pittsburgh suffered a sharp decline when its ""golden goose"" of steel production declined. In recent decades,the city has made a dramatic comebackas a ""brains economy"" featuring robotics firms working with researchers at nearby universities and the rise of the health-innovation economy. After decades of decline, census estimates show that the Pittsburgh area's population finally leveled off from 2010 to 2022 and suggest that the number of people living in the citycould bounce back in the coming years. Pittsburgh's rebound offers an optimistic case study for other Rust Belt cities. The shifting climate does not mean that there will be a sudden migration of Americans to the middle of the country. Many people still stick close to home: A 2015 report from The New York Times found that the averageAmerican lived only 18 miles from their mother. And the cities that could become climate havens have their weather downsides — Buffalo will still have some harsh winters, too. But even in small numbers, regional migration will have serious downstream effects on America's cities. If Buffalo, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and other cities succeed in their climate-resilience agendas, they will grow, attracting residents from more at-risk areas of the country. That, in turn, will force at-risk cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Phoenix to invest more to offset their heat and flood risk. Even on a city level, competition fosters innovation — and the great ""Super Bowl"" of climate competition will spur our collective adaptation. Matthew E.

More than 300 schools are shut across the region, while major incidents have been declared in Hampshire, the Isle of Wight and Jersey. Dozens of people in Jersey were evacuated to hotels overnight as wind gusts of up to 102mph uprooted trees and damaged homes. The Grand Hotel in St Helier was damaged, with the side rendering ripped away after winds tore through the island in the early hours of the morning. The storm is causing severe disruption in the south of England with strong winds and rain affecting many transport routes. The Environment Agency says flooding is expected in 82 areas, most of which are on the south coast. The Port of Dover suspended all sailings earlier, sparking long lorry queues - it has since reopened for shipping, but passenger ferries are cancelled. Coastal regions of north-west France have been battered by gale-force winds of 128mph (207km/h), as Storm Ciarán reached Brittany and Normandy. Power provider Enedis says 1.2 million people are without electricity, after falling trees brought down power lines and pylons. Some of the worst damage has been reported in Finistère, in the far north-west, where gusts of 128mph were recorded at Pointe-du-Raz. The local prefect has barred all traffic from the roads apart from emergency services and other essential transport.

There is widespread flooding and damage around the UK, with thousands of homes left without power, hundreds of schools closed and major travel disruption. Southern England and the Channel Islands have been worst-hit by Ciarán, with 80 flood warnings still in place across England. No UK deaths have so far been linked to the rain and 100mph (161km/h) gusts. But countless homes around the country have been severely damaged - with some residents even believing they have been hit by tornadoes - and many still assessing the full scale of the destruction. It follows a series of other flooding incidents in recent weeks. One yellow weather warning for rain remains in place until Friday evening in eastern Scotland, with the rest of the country no longer covered by any other weather warnings. More than 200 flood alerts have been issued for England, alongside the 86 flood warnings where flooding is expected, but there are currently no severe flood warnings - the highest category - in place. Dozens of people in Jersey were evacuated to hotels overnight on Wednesday after gusts of up to 102mph (164km/h) were recorded. Locals were also hit by huge hailstones ""bigger than golf balls"". In St Clement, Sharon Mackie Marquer filmed video showing the destruction around her home, with roof tiles littering her garden and the fence knocked over. Cars smashed up by debris and overturned tables can also be seen. A clip from the same Jersey parish showed Jessica O'Reilly sleeping in bed alongside her baby when the sound of the 'weather bomb' woke her - seconds before the window was blown inwards. She described the moment her ""motherly instinct"" kicked in, telling the BBC: ""We went up to bed and could hear the wind getting stronger and stronger, closer and closer. ""Something didn't seem right, then the windows just smashed in, I grabbed [my daughter] and got out the room. ""I think I just thought 'my baby's in danger, I need to get out' and ran down the stairs."" She added that her house is not habitable as there is still glass everywhere, and they are having to stay in a hotel - but despite the shock, there was ""not a scratch"" on mother or baby. St Helier-based Carl Walker, the chairman of Jersey's Consumer Council, said his family were woken by hailstones at midnight, which he said had stuck together to create ""golf ball-sized lumps of ice"". He explained: ""We camped out in our living room downstairs with our children because it was just simply too noisy and too frightening to be upstairs in the bedrooms - tiles were lifting, debris was hitting the roof, windows were flexing. ""The noise of the wind was just incredible and quite frightening. It was like a scene from a disaster movie."" Mags Balston, who is in her 80s and has lived in her house in Jersey for 21 years, told the BBC that she is still in shock after spending the night in her kitchen after the windows blew in. She recalls ""a sudden explosion like a bomb had gone off"" but wants to stay in her home as she does not want to move the cat. Elsewhere across the British Isles, roofs have been blown off, some train lines have completely ground to a halt and there were long queues around the Port of Dover, which shut earlier amid rough seas. Some train companies had asked commuters to work from home ahead of major disruption to lines in southern England and Scotland. South Western Railway was among the rail providers impacted and said services across the whole network may be cancelled, delayed or revised - with disruptions expected until the end of Thursday. The storm caused chaos for drivers too, and the AA, which had a large number of callouts in southern England, said it had rescued 84 customers stuck in floods so far on Thursday. One driver caught in flood water was being treated for hypothermia, it added. There was also significant disruption at airports, with all flights from Jersey, Guernsey and Alderney cancelled on Thursday. In Northern Ireland, which is experiencing flooding following heavy rain and weather warnings earlier this week, one assembly member branded the scenes in County Down ""apocalyptic"", with flood waters ""decimating"" local businesses. In France, where 1.2 million people were reported to be without electricity, a lorry driver was killed after being struck by a falling tree. Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands have also been badly hit. Around 9,000 homes across Devon and Cornwall, Sussex, Surrey and the Channel Islands were left without power earlier today. Emergency services said earlier an unoccupied vehicle which washed off a promenade in Devon on Wednesday night will remain on a beach until it is safe to recover it. In Falmouth, student Kate Marsh told the BBC she was woken at 05:30 GMT when the roof of her bedroom entirely blew off and collapsed onto her. Aaron Waterer had a similar experience in his motorhome in Broadstairs, Kent. A large tree branch was ripped off in strong winds and pierced the roof - ending up just centimetres above his mattress. But 47-year-old Mr Waterer was out of bed getting a drink of water at the time of the incident, around 02:00 GMT. ""My nerves were all shot"", he said. ""I just didn't know what to do, it was just shock. I still don't think it has sunk in that much, it's just bizarre."" In south Wales, a caravan park was evacuated following a risk to life warning, with ""the majority"" of the Kiln Park site underwater. One man was pictured kayaking through the area. In Dorset, firefighters evacuated 70 people from 198 caravans at Freshwater Holiday Park in Burton Bradstock, near Bridport, with some being taken to dry land by boat. Many children remained at home across the country, as more than 300 schools closed in southern England, mainly in Devon. Albourne School in Hassocks, West Sussex, closed after it was struck by lightning, lost power and was flooded. The Government of Jersey said schools will close for a second day on Friday, as they aim to get pupils back in classrooms on Monday. Elizabeth Rizzini, from BBC Weather, said many coastal areas had been exposed to dangerously large waves. ""The wind gusts have now peaked... winds will ease as we head through the rest of (Thursday) as the storm pulls out into the North Sea"", she explained. But Ms Rizzini warned some gusts of 60-65mph (97-105km/h) could still be expected along the coast, particularly in eastern areas. She added: ""We are going to see more heavy rain, another 40 to 60mm perhaps over the higher ground of the Pennines."" Strong winds and rain are expected overnight in north-east England and northern Scotland, but Friday is forecast to be calmer. Storm Ciarán is the third named storm of the year, after Babet caused significant flooding to thousands of homes a fortnight ago, and Agnes struck in late September. BBC Weather's Matt Taylor confirmed that Ciarán has been classified as a weather bomb, or 'explosive cyclogenesis'. He explained that meteorologists use the term for a storm ""that appears to intensify rapidly, with its central air pressure dropping by at least 24 millibars (mb) in 24 hours."" Experts say a warming atmosphere increases the chance of intense rainfall and storms. However, many factors contribute to extreme weather and it takes time for scientists to calculate how much impact climate change has had on particular events - if any. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

Climate change makes heavy rain more common, because a hotter atmosphere can hold more moisture. The world is facing more extreme weather that scientists say is fueled by human-driven climate change. The poorest countries have done the least to cause the problem, but they are being hit the hardest by more intense droughts and floods and storms. Yet as the threats from a warming planet grow, the United Nations says in a new report that less money is being sent to developing countries to help them adapt. Developing countries, which have less wealth than developed countries like the United States, were promised $100 billion a year from their richer neighbors to help pay for cutting climate pollution and coping with the impacts of rising temperatures. Developed countriesdidn't deliver on their pledge. In 2021, they actually gave poorer nations 15% less money for climate adaptation than they did the year before. That meant less money for things like flood defenses, drought-resistant crops and early warning systems to help people evacuate emergencies. The UN estimates the gap between how much money developing countries need to pay for adaptation projects, and the amount of public funding they're getting directly from wealthier countries and from institutions like the World Bank now stands at between $194 billion and $366 billion every year. Put another way, poorer countries need at least 10 times more money for climate adaptation than the $21.3 billion in public funding that they received in 2021. The longer that gap persists and countries are forced to put off investments that could help blunt the impact of climate change, the moredamage they're going to suffer. That reality led to the creation of a ""loss and damage"" fund at last year's annual UN climate negotiations, and the talks at COP28 later this year in the United Arab Emirates will focus on how to get the fund up and running. ""People do want to adapt, do see climate change coming, do know what to do — but there's no finance available to actually do it,"" says Pieter Pauw, a researcher at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands who was one of the authors of the UN report. ""So, we'll see things like we saw last year in Pakistan, where almost a third of the country was flooded,"" Pauw says, ""partly because people are not adapted to climate change."" The flooding in Pakistan last summerkilled at least 1,700 peopleand caused an estimated$14.9 billion in damage. Climate changemakes heavy rain more common, because a hotter atmosphere can hold more moisture. The UN released its report on climate funding days afteran international group of scientists saidcountries probably won't hit a target they set to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to average temperatures in the late 1800s. Beyond that point, scientists say it is more likely that the world will suffer catastrophic climate impacts, like mass extinctions and a significant rise in sea levels. Earth's average temperature over the past decade was about 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial temperatures. Global warming is ""hitting some of these developing countries already quite hard,"" says Paul Watkiss, a climate change consultant and another author of the UN funding report. ""By not providing adaptation finance, or countries not being able to put sufficient resources to do adaptation, it means it's impacting [their] development."" It isn't clear if the funding gap can be quickly filled. Developed countries previously said they wouldat least double their adaptation fundingto around $40 billion annually by 2025. That's still just a fraction of what developing nations need. While countries haveanother year to set new targets for climate finance, the UAE, which is hosting this year's UN climate summit, seems to be making the issue a priority, says Adrianna Hardaway, senior policy advisory for climate at Mercy Corps, a humanitarian group. ""I think that perhaps compared to previous years, we are seeing more attention dedicated to the fact that not only is there not enough climate finance, but that it's really not reaching the people and the places that it has to go most,"" Hardaway says. Researchers say companies have also shown more interest in helping to make poorer countries more resilient to climate change, in part to protect their own supply chains. Efforts are also underway to get more climate funding to developing countries by changing how institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund operate. ""We've done the least to cause this problem, but it's still us who stands to suffer the most,"" says Wanjira Mathai, managing director of Africa and global partnerships at the World Resources Institute. ""And so we have to put in place — quickly and swiftly — all of the adaptation strategies that we can and focus on making sure that we build resilience against the immediate danger of climate change.""","['pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'netherlands']",us,True,False

However, a team of researchers at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) found this was not true for Singapore's coasts.The study, published in the journalMarine Geologyin September, found that even at high rates ofsea-levelrise (five millimeters per year—one millimeter above current rates), the southern coastal area stayed resilient and extended seawards.Coasts usually retreat as sea levels rise, low-lying coastal areas get flooded, submerging coastal land and eroding coastal features such as cliffs and shorelines, leading to landward retreat.The study by scientists at NTU Singapore's Earth Observatory of Singapore found that the key to the resilience of Singapore's coasts was the steadily high amount ofsedimentdeposited around them, which acted as a safeguard againstsea-level rise.Through an analysis of sediment collected from Singapore's Marina South, the researchers discovered that the country's sediment-rich coasts evolved from mangroves to estuaries and, finally acoastal areawith ariver deltabetween 10,000 and 7,000 years ago during a period of high sea-level rise.According to the researchers, current research suggests that when the sea-level rise rate is greater than the rate of sedimentation, the coast retreats and vice-versa. However, their study provides the first quantified threshold value of 1.7, showing that the ancient Singapore coast was stable and moved seaward even when sea-level rise was up to 1.7 times the sedimentation rate. Prior to this, studies used a hypothetical one-to-one ratio to describe the relationship between sedimentation and sea-level rise.The study provides new insights into the interplay between rising sea levels and sedimentation, showing that a coast with high sediment supply, such as Singapore's during the past thousands of years, could mitigate sea level rise.Lead author Assistant Professor Stephen Chua, from the Earth Observatory of Singapore at NTU Singapore, said, ""The findings from our study shed light on the remarkable value of sediment supply on the resilience of Singapore's coastal systems during periods of rapid sea-level rise. This historical perspective is invaluable as it offers insights into the potential responses of Singapore's coastal systems to future sea-level rise scenarios.""This method can also be applied for informed decision-making, sustainable coastal management, and the development of strategies to mitigate the impacts for the countries in South, Southeast, and East Asia, as they are home to billions of people vulnerable to rising sea levels.""Second author Professor Adam Switzer, Principal Investigator at NTU's Earth Observatory of Singapore, said, ""Establishing a threshold between sedimentation and sea level rise rates represents a positive step in our understanding of coastal resilience. Accurate data on sedimentation rates informs the design and construction of coastal infrastructure, including sea walls and flood defenses. Understanding how sediments accumulate or erode can lead to more effective engineering solutions that consider natural processes.""The findings are an example of research supporting the NTU 2025strategic plan, which seeks to address humanity's grand challenges on sustainability and accelerate the translation of research discoveries into innovations that mitigate human environmental impact.NTU Asian School of the Environment Professor Adam Switzer and NTU Earth Observatory of Singapore Assistant Professor Stephen Chua examining a sediment core collected from Singapore’s Marina South. Credit: Nanyang Technological UniversitySedimentation in today's contextSedimentation occurs when rivers carry sediment, such as gravel, sand, and silt, towards coastal areas where they get deposited. This process acts as a natural guardian against rising sea levels as it replenishes eroded sediments and retains coastal areas' natural shape and boundary.These coastal sediments also support the growth of critical coastal habitats, such as mangroves and salt marshes, further enhancing coastal resilience, biodiversity, and carbon storage.However, urbanization in countries worldwide has led to reduced sedimentation rates along coastlines due to land reclamation, infrastructure development, altered river courses, and stormwater management.While urbanization brings economic benefits and development opportunities, it also challenges coastal ecosystems and requires careful planning to mitigate the negative impacts on sedimentation and coastal resilience.The current sedimentation rate in Singapore is still unknown, although the NTU team estimates it to remain high due to the high rainfall in Singapore.Chua added, ""We expect sedimentation rates to be high in Singapore, as it is situated in an equatorial region with high weathering and sediment transport rates. Several rivers, including the Singapore, Kallang and Buloh Rivers, influence the island nation and transport sediments from catchment areas to coastal areas. Our future work aims to accurately ascertain sedimentation rate and distribution patterns to better inform policymakers in the ongoing effort to safeguard Singapore's coastline.""Switzer added, ""Despite rapid urbanization globally, which might have affected sedimentation, Singapore is an outlier as it has implemented strategic coastal management and development plans that consider sedimentation rates. These plans often involve measures to ensure thatsedimentationremains relatively high, as it contributes to the stability and resilience of coastal areas.""The team adds that combining strategic management of sediment supply with preserving and restoring mangroves offers a holistic and nature-based approach to combat sea level rise. This strategy harnesses the power of natural processes and ecosystems to enhance coastal resilience, protect communities, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. It represents a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to coastal management in the face of rising sea levels.","['singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'unitedstates']",gb,False,False

International funding for climate resilience in developing countries slumped in 2021 despite increasi… [+453 chars]",Climate,"PARIS: International funding for climate resilience in developing countries slumped in 2021 despite increasingly ferocious impacts, the United Nations said Thursday, as Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned action was ""stalling"" even as the need to protect people increases. Many developing economies least to blame for the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming are among the most exposed to the costly and destructive effects of worsening weather extremes and rising seas.But in its latest annual assessment of climate preparedness funding, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) found that public finance to developing countries fell 15 percent to around $21 billion in 2021 -- the most recent year for which figures are available.Meanwhile, the overall annual funding that developing countries need to adapt to climate impacts this decade is projected to have increased to as much as $387 billion, UNEP said.""Storms, fires, floods, drought and extreme temperatures are becoming more frequent and more ferocious, and they're on course to get far worse,"" Guterres said in a statement, adding that the need to protect people and nature was ""more pressing than ever"". ""Yet, as needs rise, action is stalling,"" he said. World leaders meeting at this year's climate talks in the United Arab Emirates will face a tough reckoning over financial solidarity between rich polluters and vulnerable nations, as a failure to cut planet-heating emissions threatens the Paris deal's global warming limits.""The world must urgently cut greenhouse gas emissions and increase adaptation efforts to protect vulnerable populations,"" said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP, in the foreword to the Adaptation Gap report. ""Neither is happening."" Damage controlAs the world warms, climate change impacts increase and so too do the costs of preparing for them. Richer countries promised in 2009 to provide $100 billion a year to finance both adaptation and emissions cuts in developing countries by 2020. But it only reached $83 billion that year, according to the most recent figures available from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Failure to meet the target on time has damaged trust in international climate negotiations. ""Developing countries stand ready, awaiting the necessary funds to safeguard their people against imminent climate disasters,"" said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at campaign consortium Climate Action Network International. ""Without timely adaptation, we are setting the stage for unimaginable loss of lives and livelihoods caused by relentless floods, raging wildfires, and surging seas.""UNEP said its analysis found that public financing for adaptation dropped to $21.3 billion in 2021, from $25.2 billion in 2020. It said the fall set a ""worrying precedent"", particularly because it came in a year that saw wealthy nations pledge at UN climate talks in Glasgow to double annual adaptation funding by 2025, from 2019 levels, to $40 billion.Report co-author Paul Watkiss said it was too soon to discern a trend, although international circumstances remain ""challenging"", going from the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, to Russia's invasion of Ukraine the following year. After a major update to its methods, UNEP said it now expects developing countries to need more funds to prepare for climate impacts, giving a range of between $215 billion to $387 billion per year this decade.That is based on the difference between the costs of adaptation calculated using computer models and financing needs implied by countries' published national climate plans, if they have them. UNEP said this amounts to roughly one percent of gross domestic product in developing countries on average, but in the least developed countries and vulnerable small islands it is around 2 percent of GDP. Even if wealthy governments meet their promise of doubling adaptation finance by 2025, the gap between available funding and needs would still be vast, UNEP said, proposing a range of additional sources of money. These include international and private sector finance, and reforms proposed by developing countries of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to align with climate priorities. Adaptation is a good investment, the report stressed, citing research that every billion spent on adaptation against coastal flooding leads to a $14 billion reduction in economic damages.The failure to cut emissions is already causing intensifying climate impacts, slamming communities and causing growing losses and damages. This led to an agreement at last year's climate talks in Egypt for a new fund to help vulnerable nations. Guterres said one stream of funding for this should come from a windfall tax on the fossil fuel industry. ""Fossil fuel barons and their enablers have helped create this mess; they must support those suffering as a result,"" he said.","['unitedstates', 'france', 'canada', 'unitedkingdom', 'russia', 'ukraine', 'egypt']",in,False,False

Integrated Report 2023 Material IssueStrengthen supply chain management In order for a company to fulfill its social responsibilities, it is important to build relationships of trust and collaborate not only within its own corporate group but also with its business partners. SHIONOGI is working to strengthen supply chain management by cooperating with suppliers based on the SHIONOGI Group Procurement Policy and the SHIONOGI Group Business Partner Code of Conduct, which define the basic concepts for conducting procurement activities based on honesty, accuracy, fairness, and transparency. Initiatives for sustainable procurement We established the SHIONOGI Group Procurement Policy and the SHIONOGI Group Business Partner Code of Conduct and are assessing risks in the supply chain, such as human rights, labor, and the environment, and identifying issues by obtaining cooperation in surveys and audits primarily from significant suppliers. For the issues we have identified, we are working to realize sustainable procurement by engaging with the relevant suppliers and building a PDCA cycle for making improvements cooperatively. of Conduct. In fiscal 2022, we were able to obtain agreements from all new suppliers. In fiscal 2023, we will expand these initiatives to include business partners with whom we have an ongoing business relationship. In order to address social issues throughout the supply chain, we will work to obtain consent from all business partners and expand efforts for improvement. III Mechanisms Supplier engagement program Suppliers that SHIONOGI engages with are selected based on the SHIONOGI Group Procurement Policy and taking into account geopolitical risks and risks specific to the industries and raw materials of our business partners. In fiscal 2022, we revised the selection process, identifying suppliers who met any of the following requirements: large transaction value, items related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), development and manufacture of products that should continue to be supplied from the perspective of social responsibility and company management, and existence of risks related to human rights and the environment, as ""signifi- cant suppliers"" that are particularly necessary for the stable provision of SHIONOGI products and services to the market.

By increasing loading efficiency and reducing the number of operations through joint delivery, we aim to maintain stable pharmaceutical logistics in compliance with GDP, respond to the 2024 problem in logistics and reduce CO2emissions. Integrated Report 2023 77 IIIMechanisms Supporting SHIONOGI's Growth Responsibility to Society Material IssueSupply socially responsible products and services It is SHIONOGI's duty as a life-related company to protect people's health by providing a stable supply of essential, high-quality products and services. In addition to establishing a system for stable supply so that stakeholders can use SHIONOGI products and services with confidence, we are also working Groupwide to provide high-quality information on quality, safety, and proper use. Efforts to achieve stable supply In order to ensure that the supply of products is not interrupted under any circumstances, SHIONOGI regularly assesses risks related to procurement from suppliers such as raw material manufacturers and manufacturing contractors, and takes measures such as promoting improvements, adding alternative suppliers, and establishing redundant procurement for high-risk suppliers. We have also set strict targets for product delivery indicators to strengthen our supply system so that we can deliver SHIONOGI products and services to patients and healthcare professionals in a stable manner. Fostering a quality culture In recent years, there have been several incidents in Japan related to violations of legal compliance in pharmaceutical manufacturing. In order to prevent similar incidents from occurring, SHIONOGI is working to foster a quality culture including at Group companies and to advance a mindset of rigorous compliance not only within the Group but also in the supply chain. of the officer in charge are clearly defined, and training on legal compliance for SHIONOGI employees is continuously conducted under an appropriate management system based on the three-role system of Pharmaceutical Officer, Quality Assurance Supervisor and Safety Supervisor.

Integrated Report 2023 Material IssueRespect human rights SHIONOGI recognizes the importance of respecting the human rights of all stakeholders in the course of its business activities. We promote initiatives that are in line with the SHIONOGI Group Human Rights Policy, which was established based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). Human rights due diligence In order to promote the identification, prevention, and reduction of human rights risks, SHIONOGI conducts human rights due diligence on all businesses and narrows down the areas in which risks should be more carefully scrutinized. In fiscal 2022, as in fiscal 2021, as part of the survey on labor conditions in manufacturing areas of raw materials and materials, we conducted direct dialogue with suppliers of glass, ethanol, and aluminum, which are important items, to understand human rights issues throughout the supply chain. In addition, we conducted a survey on foreign technical intern trainees at suppliers of COVID-19-related products and confirmed that they did not have technical intern trainees. Moreover, when we recognize human rights risks that have not been identified in the course of conducting our business, we have put in place a system that allows us to promptly share information and take countermeasures. As a specific example, in August 2022, after learning that forced labor in the manufacture of rubber gloves in Malaysia had become a problem, we promptly shared the information internally and conducted an investigation into the primary supplier from which SHIONOGI purchased rubber gloves. As a result, it was confirmed that while the product had been purchased in the past, it was not purchased or used at the time the problem was recognized. We will continue to closely monitor such developments in forced labor.

We are always conscious of contributing to the conservation of the natural environment and the realization of a sustainable society by efficiently using natural capital such as energy and water and purchased raw materials, providing pharmaceuticals and services, and appropriately managing and treating waste and wastewater generated in the process. With this in mind, we are strengthening Environmental and Health and Safety (EHS) initiatives throughout the Group. Climate change initiatives As part of the medium- to long-term SHIONOGI Group EHS Action Targets, we have set ""reduce greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions"" as an indicator aimed at reducing risks related to climate change. In addition, we have set Science Based Targets (SBT) as greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for fiscal 2030 with the aim of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and obtained approval from the SBT Initiative in June 2021. mainly at major business sites such as SHIONOGI Group plants and research laboratories, and are advancing initiatives to reduce CO2emissions. In addition to the introduction of renewable energy-derived electricity at the CMC Innovation Center in fiscal 2023, the introduction of renewable energy -derived electricity at the Pharmaceutical Research Center was completed ahead of schedule. SHIONOGI has achieved a 100% introduction rate of renewable energy-derived electricity to the main sites of research laboratories. Going forward, 80 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2023 we plan to promote the introduction of renewable energy -derived electricity, particularly at Shionogi Pharma's plants, and aim to achieve a 100% introduction rate of renewable energy-derived electricity to the main sites of the SHIONOGI Group by fiscal 2030.

Risks and opportunities The results of SHIONOGI's assessment of climate change-related risks and opportunities based on scenario analysis conducted in fiscal 2022 are shown in the table on the next page. We have identified three risks and opportunities arising from climate change, which have a relatively large financial impact: (1) introduction of carbon pricing, (2) impacts on raw materials procurement due to localized extreme weather and temperature rises, and (3) sea level rise. Estimates made at the time of the assessment confirm that even if all identified risks and opportunities were to materi- alize, the negative financial impact on core operating profit, which had been targeted for 2030, the final year of the medium-term management plan STS2030, would be only Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

In the STS2030 Revision revised in June 2023, we aim to further increase earnings compared to the initial STS2030; thus, we judge that the resilience of our business to possible climate change scenarios is sufficiently ensured.

Therefore, we will carry out medium- to long-term activities to reduce SHIONOGI's greenhouse gas emissions Pricing and mitigate risks. Impacts on Raw As the population of horseshoe crabs decreases due to climate change, it will not be possible to procure lysate reagents made from their blood components Materials Procurement and quality tests will not be possible, and the worst case scenario is assumed to be the suspension of shipments of some main pharmaceuticals. However, due to Localized Extreme horseshoe crab conservation activities are being carried out on the reagent manufacturer's side, or even if it becomes difficult to procure lysate reagents, Weather and there are alternative reagents using genetically modified proteins. Therefore, although the long-term possibility cannot be ruled out, we judge that the Temperature Rises probability of risk occurring in 2030 is extremely low at this time, and we accept this risk. The long-term trend of sea level rise due to climate change is unquestionable, and we assume that the worst case is the possibility that it will adversely Sea Level Rise affect the operations of some of SHIONOGI's major sites located in particularly low lying areas. However, the average sea level rise along the Japan coast is projected to be less than 0.2 m from 2031 to 2050. Therefore, although the long-term possibility cannot be ruled out, we judge that the probability of risk occurring in 2030 is extremely low at this time, and we accept this risk.

Each New Acre of projects delivers numerous benefits for communities, including resilience to extreme weather, such as flood, drought and extreme heat. The long-term outcomes of these projects are critical to global efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change, biodiversity loss and other environmental challenges. Financial support for New Acre Project empowers farmers and ranchers working with ALUS to create, enhance, manage and maintain nature-based solutions, including windbreaks, buffer strips and more. These are local solutions to global challenges. ""We are proud to continue our support for ALUS' New Acre Project to help elevate the quality of the environment through nature-based solutions delivered by Canadian farmers and ranchers,"" says Joshua Cayer, Manager, Philanthropy, Sustainability & Corporate Citizenship, TD Bank Group. ""Through the TD Ready Commitment, we are focused on supporting innovative community projects that help create equitable access to green spaces, while also providing invaluable social and economic benefits to communities and the people who live within them."" By funding New Acre Project, TD is supporting ALUS’ work to build a vibrant environment, preventing nature loss and planting trees and shrubs in rural Canadian communities. To date, TD has funded 665 acres of projects that have planted over 35,000 native trees and nearly 10,000 native shrubs, with more projects being added in 2023. These project acres are contributing to local biodiversity and providing valuable ecosystem services that deliver economic value for communities. In 2023, TD has supported 115 acres of naturalization projects in rural communities. Since 2018, TD’s support has contributed to projects in thirteen communities in the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. ALUS communities in these five provinces work with local farmers and ranchers to develop targeted, local, market-driven solutions to environmental management challenges on working agricultural properties. “In its fifth year, the collaboration with TD is as important for New Acre Project now as it was in 2018. Consistent support such as what TD offers means ALUS can continue to grow its stock of projects that sequester carbon, slow erosion and capture and store nutrients on the rural landscape,” says Katherine Balpataky, Senior Director of Corporate Partnerships at ALUS. ALUS’ New Acre Project is a market-leading offering with an innovative and valuable solution to the climate and biodiversity crises: a network of farmers and ranchers putting environmental projects in the ground. Farmers and ranchers continue to join their local ALUS communities, because the program empowers them as solution providers, giving them the necessary tools and resources to benefit the natural world for their communities and future generations. About ALUS and New Acre™ Project ALUS (originally an acronym for Alternative Land Use Services) is a national charitable organization that provides expertise, resources, and direct financial support to 38 communities across six provinces where more than 1,600 farmers and ranchers establish and steward nature-based solutions on their land. These solutions deliver ecosystem services to help sustain agriculture and fight climate change and biodiversity loss for the benefit of communities and future generations. Projects such as enhanced wetlands, windbreaks, riparian buffer zones, wildlife habitats, adaptive agricultural practices and other impactful environmental solutions produce cleaner air, cleaner water, greater biodiversity, carbon sequestration, erosion control, flood and drought mitigation, pollinator and wildlife habitat, and other ecological services. New Acre™ Project, delivered by ALUS, helps purpose-driven corporations invest in nature-based solutions on agricultural land that generate positive environmental, economic and social outcomes in the communities where they operate—one acre at a time. By investing in New Acre Project, corporations can strategically allocate capital and customize their impact. Each New Acre investment delivers tangible, reliable and measurable outcomes by empowering farmers and ranchers to produce ecosystem goods and services, like carbon sequestration, water filtration and enhanced habitat, that increase biodiversity and help build climate resilience.

Many developing economies least to blame for the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming are among the most exposed to the costly and destructive effects of worsening weather extremes and rising seas. But in its latest annual assessment of climate preparedness funding, the UN Environment Programme ( UNEP ) found that public finance to developing countries fell 15 percent to around $21 billion in 2021 -- the most recent year for which figures are available. Meanwhile, the overall annual funding that developing countries need to adapt to climate impacts this decade is projected to have increased to as much as $387 billion, UNEP said. ""Storms, fires, floods, drought and extreme temperatures are becoming more frequent and more ferocious, and they're on course to get far worse,"" Guterres said in a statement, adding that the need to protect people and nature was ""more pressing than ever"". ""Yet, as needs rise, action is stalling,"" he said. World leaders meeting at this year's climate talks in the United Arab Emirates will face a tough reckoning over financial solidarity between rich polluters and vulnerable nations, as a failure to cut planet-heating emissions threatens the Paris deal's global warming limits. ""The world must urgently cut greenhouse gas emissions and increase adaptation efforts to protect vulnerable populations,"" said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP, in the foreword to the Adaptation Gap report. ""Neither is happening."" Damage control As the world warms, climate change impacts increase and so too do the costs of preparing for them. Richer countries promised in 2009 to provide $100 billion a year to finance both adaptation and emissions cuts in developing countries by 2020. But it only reached $83 billion that year, according to the most recent figures available from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Failure to meet the target on time has damaged trust in international climate negotiations. ""Developing countries stand ready, awaiting the necessary funds to safeguard their people against imminent climate disasters,"" said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at campaign consortium Climate Action Network International. ""Without timely adaptation, we are setting the stage for unimaginable loss of lives and livelihoods caused by relentless floods, raging wildfires, and surging seas."" UNEP said its analysis found that public financing for adaptation dropped to $21.3 billion in 2021, from $25.2 billion in 2020. It said the fall set a ""worrying precedent"", particularly because it came in a year that saw wealthy nations pledge at UN climate talks in Glasgow to double annual adaptation funding by 2025, from 2019 levels, to $40 billion. Report co-author Paul Watkiss said it was too soon to discern a trend, although international circumstances remain ""challenging"", going from the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, to Russia's invasion of Ukraine the following year. After a major update to its methods, UNEP said it now expects developing countries to need more funds to prepare for climate impacts, giving a range of between $215 billion to $387 billion per year this decade. That is based on the difference between the costs of adaptation calculated using computer models and financing needs implied by countries' published national climate plans, if they have them. UNEP said this amounts to roughly one percent of gross domestic product in developing countries on average, but in the least developed countries and vulnerable small islands it is around 2 percent of GDP. Even if wealthy governments meet their promise of doubling adaptation finance by 2025, the gap between available funding and needs would still be vast, UNEP said, proposing a range of additional sources of money. These include international and private sector finance, and reforms proposed by developing countries of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to align with climate priorities. Adaptation is a good investment, the report stressed, citing research that every billion spent on adaptation against coastal flooding leads to a $14 billion reduction in economic damages. The failure to cut emissions is already causing intensifying climate impacts, slamming communities and causing growing losses and damages. This led to an agreement at last year's climate talks in Egypt for a new fund to help vulnerable nations. Guterres said one stream of funding for this should come from a windfall tax on the fossil fuel industry. ""Fossil fuel barons and their enablers have helped create this mess; they must support those suffering as a result,"" he said.

Worlds most loved landmarks; Taj Mahal secures 2nd spot,Climate,"PARIS: Much of northwestern Europe went on high alert Wednesday as a storm dubbed Ciaran threatened to bring gale-force winds and extreme rainfall to the region. Three French departments -- Finistere, Cotes-d'Armor and Manche -- will be placed on red storm alert, the highest level, at midnight (2300 GMT), national weather agency Meteo-France said. Meteorologists warned that the Ile-de-France region, which includes the capital Paris, could have violent wind gusts. The SNCF rail network said it would halt service on several of its suburban commuter lines around the capital, including the popular RER A train that serves western suburbs.Two French regions will also be placed on maximum flood alert, it added.Vast stretches along the French coast, from the Gironde region to the northern Hauts de France, will be on the lower category orange alert. In Pas-de-Calais, authorities said they would open two gymnasiums and several shelters for migrants who converge on the region, hoping to make it to Britain by boat. In Britain, the meteorological office said there would be bursts of heavy rain, a risk of flooding in some areas and gusts of 60-70 miles per hour along England's south coast.In France, the storm was even expected to unleash winds of up to 170 kilometres (106 miles) per hour, notably on the coastlines of Brittany and Normandy in the northwest, Meteo-France forecaster Francois Gourand warned on Tuesday. Rainfall could reach 50 millimetres within just six hours in those areas, the weather agency said. Ciaran is expected to hit Brittany before midnight Wednesday, with winds of up to 150 kmph on the coast, and 130 kmph inland with a second, more violent, storm phase following some hours later.- Rail services cancelled -Some 3,200 firefighters will be deployed in the most exposed areas, the French interior ministry said. The authorities, warning of falling trees and blocked roads, have urged people to remain indoors and stay away from the coast. The government also banned all truck traffic in Brittany for Thursday. National rail operator SNCF has stopped regional trains in the most affected areas and cancelled a number of high-speed TGV rail services. Eurostar, expecting disruptions and slowdowns, told AFP it was recommending that passengers delay any trips planned for Thursday. The Brittany airports of Brest and Quimper were ordered closed, and most ferry traffic to Breton islands is to be stopped.Coastal flooding is likely from early Thursday, Olivier Caumont, also at Meteo-France, told reporters, with waves possibly rising up to 10 metres (33 feet). Maritime authorities issued a strong warning against taking boats out to sea, or even approaching the coast ""be it by car or on foot"".- 'Lie low, fingers crossed' -They also said a powerful tugboat would be deployed to help any vessels in distress.""All we can do is to lie low and keep our fingers crossed,"" said Olivier Laban, president of the shellfish farming committee in the Arcachon basin in France's southwest.In Britain Kate Marks, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said ""significant flooding"" was possible, warning people to stay away from swollen rivers and motorists not to drive through flood water.Storm Ciaran comes less than two weeks after Storm Babet claimed five lives in the UK in heavy flooding and high winds.""Some parts of south Wales and southwest England may see 80 mm (more than three inches) of rain,"" said Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Dan Suri.Flooding due to heavy rain has already seen some 12,000 sandbags deployed in the east of Northern Ireland.The Channel Islands, off the coast of northern France, have also been warned to prepare for flooding.- As far as Spain -In Belgium, the weather office issued an orange alert for the Flemish coast, a yellow alert for the rest of the country, and urged ""great caution"".The cities of Brussels, Antwerp and Liege announced that parks would be closed.The Flemish provinces of West Flanders and East Flanders both said they would close access to outdoor sports facilities, and ban people from entering forests or natural reserves.In neighbouring Netherlands, the weather service issued a code yellow alert for Thursday, while motorists were advised to work from home to avoid traffic jams.Several schools said they would be closed or partially closed on Thursday. Ciaran's impact could be felt as far south as Spain, where wind speeds of up to 90 kph were expected for Thursday. Authorities asked people to take down tarpaulins, avoid walking under trees and remove flower pots from balconies.While storms are a naturally recurring phenomenon, they can be made worse by climate change, according to scientists. Flooding is likely to be exacerbated by rising ocean levels as a result of melting glaciers.","['france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'ireland', 'canada', 'canada', 'uk', 'spain', 'spain', 'belgium', 'belgium', 'belgium', 'netherlands']",in,False,False

At the same time, adaptation planning and implementation appear to be plateauing. This failure to adapt has massive implications for losses and damages, particularly for the most vulnerable.""In 2023,climate changeyet again became more disruptive and deadly: temperature records toppled, while storms, floods, heat waves and wildfires caused devastation,"" said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. ""These intensifying impacts tell us that the world must urgently cutgreenhouse gas emissionsand increase adaptation efforts to protect vulnerable populations. Neither is happening.""""Even if theinternational communitywere to stop emitting all greenhouse gases today, climate disruption would take decades to dissipate,"" she added. ""So, I urge policymakers to take heed of the Adaptation Gap Report, step up finance and make COP28 the moment that the world committed fully to insulatinglow-income countriesand disadvantaged groups from damaging climate impacts.""Finance, planning and implementation waningAfter a major update over previous years, the report now finds that the funds required for adaptation in developing countries are higher—estimated to be in a plausible central range of US$215 billion to US$387 billion per year this decade.The modeled costs of adaptation in developing countries are estimated at US$215 billion per year this decade and are projected to rise significantly by 2050. The adaptation finance needed to implement domestic adaptation priorities, based on extrapolation of costed Nationally Determined Contributions and National Adaptation Plans to all developing countries, is estimated at US$387 billion per year.Despite these needs, public multilateral and bilateral adaptation finance flows to developing countries declined by 15 percent to US$21 billion in 2021. This dip comes despite pledges made at COP26 in Glasgow to deliver around US$40 billion per year in adaptation finance support by 2025 and sets a worrying precedent.While five out of six countries have at least one national adaptation planning instrument, progress to reach full global coverage is slowing. And the number of adaptation actions supported through international climate funds has stagnated for the past decade.Innovative ways to deliver finance essentialAmbitious adaptation can enhance resilience—which is particularly important for low-income countries and disadvantaged groups—and head off losses and damages.The report points to a study indicating that the 55 most climate-vulnerable economies alone have experienced losses and damages of more than US$500 billion in the last two decades. These costs will rise steeply in the coming decades, particularly in the absence of forceful mitigation and adaptation.Studies indicate that every billion invested in adaptation against coastal flooding leads to a US$14 billion reduction in economic damages. Meanwhile, US$16 billion per year invested in agriculture would prevent approximately 78 million people from starving or chronic hunger because of climate impacts.However, neither the goal of doubling 2019 international finance flows todeveloping countriesby 2025 nor a possible New Collective Quantified Goal for 2030 will significantly close the adaptation finance gap on their own and deliver such benefits.This report identifies seven ways to increasing financing, including through domestic expenditure and international and private sector finance. Additional avenues include remittances, increasing and tailoring finance to Small and Medium Enterprises, implementation of Article 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement on shifting finance flows towards low-carbon and climate resilient development pathways, and a reform of the global financial architecture, as proposed by the Bridgetown Initiative.The new loss and damage fund will also be an important instrument to mobilize resources, but issues remain. The fund will need to move towards more innovative financing mechanisms to reach the necessary scale of investment.","['unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedkingdom']",gb,True,False

The flooding has caused widespread damage and disruption across parts of count… [+1003 chars]",Weather,"The damage caused by flooding in Downpatrick has ""ripped the heart out of the town"", a businessman has said. Paul McCartan, who owns two shops in the County Down town, said the damage was soul destroying and government support was needed. A number of towns in counties Down, Armagh and Antrim have been hit by heavy rainfall. ""It looks like it's gone in a flash,"" Mr McCartan said of his business. ""I've been on the street about 44 years,"" he told BBC News NI. ""Although we're fully insured, we're not covered for flood, and we're in bother."" Mr McCartan added there was no chance of the premises drying out ahead of Christmas. Another Downpatrick clothing shop owner, Brian Rodgers, said floodwater was up to chest height on Thursday morning. He said he had about £150,000 of Christmas stock inside but he could not get in to see how bad the damage was. On Thursday evening, the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said an operation to use high-volume pumps to clear the water from Market Street, Downpatrick, would begin ""once river waters are low enough"". ""Whilst there have been some indications of floodwaters increasing slightly in Downpatrick, water levels in the Quoile River have peaked and have begun to fall from early morning,"" they said. How have you been affected by the flooding? If it is safe to do so, get in touch. Social Democratic and Labour Party assembly member Colin McGrath said Downpatrick witnessed ""apocalyptic scenes"" and that about 25 businesses had been ""decimated"". He warned there were further concerns about the risks from the next high tide. DfI described recent rainfall as ""an exceptional natural event"". Bus services across the town have been suspended and parts of Portadown, County Armagh, remain badly affected. Translink confirmed its Downpatrick depot remained cut off in both directions due to flood waters and 10 bus services in the town had been suspended. Speaking to BBC News NI, Mr McGrath said many businesses in Downpatrick were not covered by flood insurance. He called for Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris to ""step up to the mark"" and provide a financial package for those affected by the flooding. A Northern Ireland Office spokesperson said the UK government has been ""in close contact"" with the civil service. ""Whilst this is a devolved matter for the relevant NI departments, we will continue to work closely with the NI Civil Service in the days ahead,"" they said. The Department for Communities is providing emergency £1,000 payments for domestic properties which have been flooded. A spokesperson for DfI said its engineering team carried out an assessment and determined it could be another 24 hours before floodwater in Market Street in Downpatrick town centre could be decreased. ""The main reason for this is that the water levels in the river and its smaller tributaries need to decrease before we can make meaningful progress,"" they said. In Kilkeel, County Down, the Newcastle Road has been closed due to serious structural damage, with the police warning people to avoid it and obey road closure signs. It is not yet clear how long the road will be closed. Paul Sloane, who lives in one of the houses directly outside the stretch of closed road, said many vehicles were ignoring road closure signs and then turning outside his property when they can go no further. Democratic Unionist Party assembly member Diane Forsyth told BBC News NI the closure was devastating for businesses and residents because it is the the main road into Kilkeel. Sinn Féin councillor Michael Rice said the feeling in the town was one of frustration. ""Those in Kilkeel feel trapped, from the initial rain on Tuesday the town has been isolated and many feel that rural areas in the Mournes did not get the same support. ""However, I can't fault the road service, the staff have been working non-stop and the damage to the road is very serious."" By BBC News NI's Darran Marshall in Portadown The flood waters in most parts of Portadown have not receded since Wednesday. The water was too deep to go in - you don't know what's underneath, it's too dangerous. Young people are travelling up the road in boats, delivering sandbags and medication. I've seen video footage from inside homes - water above the windows and washing machines floating in garages. Thirty minutes ago, portaloos were delivered to homes in the town. A drone image taken above Island Road shows three homes sitting on a small piece of land and completely surrounded by water. There are people who have no access to food and they are relying on volunteers. We are seeing the force of this water on homes, on small businesses, on the big supermarkets - they're all impacted. There are unimaginable scenes, I don't know how people are keeping their spirits high in some parts of the town. The manager of Portadown-based championship club Annagh United, Ciaran McGurgan, said its pitch was ""gone"". ""We don't know what sort of destruction has been done underneath it in terms of sand and stones and whatever else,"" he told BBC's Evening Extra. He said the impact of the damage would have a ""knock-on effect across the community"" with multiple organisations and schools using club facilities on a regular basis. Dee Herron from Killyleagh YC Football Club said ""the water keeps on coming"" but their main pitch was completely flooded. Mr Herron said representatives from the Irish Football Association had visited the club and ""promised a bit of help"". ""We need help, absolutely,"" he said. Rodney Watson, from Watson Autos, a vehicle recovery firm in Portadown, said he had recovered more than 20 vehicles from floodwaters across the town over the past 24 hours. He said some cars were floating in the train station car park and that the water level was much higher on Thursday than the previous day. DfI said since Monday there had been more than 13,000 calls to the Flooding Incident Line and approximately 13,000 sandbags had been deployed. The Scheme of Emergency Financial Assistance (SEFA) has been made available to homeowners who have encountered significant inconvenience due to flooding inside their homes. It offers eligible applicants a £1,000 payment through their respective local councils. The department warned the public to pay attention to road closure advice with many roads still not suitable for traffic due to flood conditions.","['unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'switzerland', 'switzerland', 'uk']",gb,True,True

A vehicle washed off Sidmouth Esplanade overnight was a stark reminder of the storm's 60mph (96km/h) impact, while roads were closed amid floods, fallen trees and landslips. More than 900 properties across the county were left without power and more than 250 schools were shut. Twenty flood warnings remain in place. Hundreds of trees were blown down, one damaging a police car near Kingsbridge, with its driver taken to hospital. Devon and Cornwall Police advised drivers against venturing out unless essential amid fears that rivers would burst their banks. As well as the 20 flood warnings, 29 more rivers remain on flood alert, which means flooding is possible, according to the Environment Agency. Flooding was reported by residents in Seaton, on the Jurassic Coast, where the green and playground were left waterlogged. David Noble, owner of the South Sands Hotel in Salcombe, described a ""devastating end to Storm Ciarán"" as a big swell blew off windows, doors and ""flooded the downstairs restaurant"". As mopping up continued, he said it was probably the worst storm he had experienced at the hotel since he bought it 14 years ago. Train travellers, meanwhile, have faced a ""bleak"" day, said operator GWR, which cancelled trains between Exeter and Taunton, with no replacement bus service because they too were impacted. More than 250 schools were closed across the country, Devon County Council said. On Dartmoor the rain was coming in ""horizontally"", one caller told BBC Radio Devon. ""It's blowing a hoolie out here, I think it's raining sideways,"" said Ian Cobham, from Princetown, on Dartmoor. ""If you get out of the car and walk across the car park you are soaking wet in seconds,"" said the Dartmoor Brewery manager. ""It's pretty horrible out here."" The storm's power was also evident at the Tinside Lido in Plymouth, where waves had overwhelmed the site. Meanwhile, Devon County Council's emergency control centre reported road closures across the county. While the main road between Modbury and Ermington was closed in both directions after a landslip, other impacted routes included the link road between the A38 and A380 at Haldon Hill, due to flooding, and Jubilee Road in Totnes because of a fallen tree. A planned overnight closure of part of the A30 has been called off due to flooding. In Plymouth, an emergency road closure was in place on Cliff Road after ""hoardings and boards came loose in the storm"", the city council said. Embankment Road was also closed inbound, due to an electrical fault outside a shop, with National Grid on site. In east Devon, flood water rose on land in Axminster, blocking a lane and leaving the area looking like a ""new lake"", according to one resident on social media. Plymouth's household waste recycling site at Chelson Meadow has reopened after high winds in the morning forced its closure, said the city council. Police said the vehicle washed off Sidmouth Esplanade had been ""left unattended on the ledge of a boat ramp"" and would be recovered when ""conditions are safe"". Devon and Cornwall was under a Met Office amber warning until 11:00 GMT, which had warned of winds of up to 60 to 70 mph. From 11:00, a yellow weather warning was in place for the South West for wind and rain, which was set to remain in place until 17:00, with wind strengths of 50 to 60 mph expected along the coast.

Network Rail said investigations were underway to fix the fault. Disruption is expected to last until 23:00. It comes as trains in parts of Scotland were already facing delays until Saturday as a result of Storm Ciarán. LNER said there would be no services between Edinburgh and Aberdeen until Saturday. Speed restrictions will cause delays elsewhere. A yellow warning for rain is in place for the UK's east coast, from Moray down to Hull until 18:00 on Friday. Storm Ciarán caused wind gusts of more than 100mph in England on Thursday. LNER's service between Newcastle and Edinburgh was running hourly until the end of service on Friday. Speed restrictions will be in place on the route, which may see trains subject to delays of up to 40 minutes. Network Rail said it was also imposing speed restrictions across parts of Scotland and some areas would see delays. Speed restrictions will be in place on routes between Aberdeen and Inverness; Dundee and Aberdeen; Inverness and Wick; and Perth and Inverness. ScotRail said the first of these restrictions would be in place from 15:00 on Thursday and last until 08:00 on Saturday. Direct services between Edinburgh and Glasgow to Aberdeen have been cancelled from Friday morning until mid-afternoon, with passengers required to change trains at Dundee. David Simpson, ScotRail service delivery director, said: ""The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for Storm Ciaran, which is expected to bring heavy rain across the east coast of Scotland. ""Our first priority is always to ensure the safety of our staff and customers, so as a precautionary measure, speed restrictions will be in place across the Highlands and east coast. This will result in extended journey times along the affected routes."" TransPennine Express services between Newcastle and Edinburgh will also be subject to delays, with the operator urging passengers to check their journeys ahead of travel. The Met Office believes the storm's path will now be further south than originally anticipated.

SHIONOGI is working to strengthen supply chain management by cooperating with suppliers based on the SHIONOGI Group Procurement Policy and the SHIONOGI Group Business Partner Code of Conduct, which define the basic concepts for conducting procurement activities based on honesty, accuracy, fairness, and transparency. Initiatives for sustainable procurement Strengthen Supply Chain Management Supply Socially Responsible Products and Services * Corporate culture that gives top priority to quality Respect Human Rights We established the SHIONOGI Group Procurement Policy and the SHIONOGI Group Business Partner Code of Conduct and are assessing risks in the supply chain, such as human rights, labor, and the environment, and identifying issues by obtaining cooperation in surveys and audits primarily from significant suppliers. For the issues we have identified, we are working to realize sustainable procurement by engaging with the relevant suppliers and building a PDCA cycle for making improvements cooperatively. When considering collaboration with new business part- ners, we evaluate and select companies in accordance with the SHIONOGI Group Procurement Policy, and at the start of Conduct. In fiscal 2022, we were able to obtain agreements from all new suppliers. In fiscal 2023, we will expand these initiatives to include business partners with whom we have an ongoing business relationship. In order to address social issues throughout the supply chain, we will work to obtain consent from all business partners and expand efforts for improvement. To raise awareness of sustainable procurement, we have established and disseminate SOP that stipulate matters related to social issues, such as human rights, labor, and the environment, that employees involved in procurement operations should understand and follow.

In addition to establishing a system for stable supply so that stakeholders can use SHIONOGI products and services with confidence, we are also working Groupwide to provide high-quality information on quality, safety, and proper use. Material IssueRespect human rights SHIONOGI recognizes the importance of respecting the human rights of all stakeholders in the course of its business activities. We promote initiatives that are in line with the SHIONOGI Group Human Rights Policy, which was established based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). Efforts to achieve stable supply Human rights due diligence In order to ensure that the supply of products is not interrupted under any circumstances, SHIONOGI regularly assesses risks related to procurement from suppliers such as raw material manufacturers and manufacturing contractors, and takes measures such as promoting improvements, adding alternative suppliers, and establishing redundant procurement for high-risk suppliers. We have also set strict targets for product delivery indicators to strengthen our supply system so that we can deliver SHIONOGI products and services to patients and healthcare professionals in a stable manner. In order to promote the identification, prevention, and reduction of human rights risks, SHIONOGI conducts human rights due diligence on all businesses and narrows down the areas in which risks should be more carefully scrutinized. In fiscal 2022, as in fiscal 2021, as part of the survey on labor conditions in manufacturing areas of raw materials and materials, we conducted direct dialogue with suppliers of glass, ethanol, and aluminum, which are important items, to understand human rights issues throughout the supply chain. In addition, we conducted a survey on foreign technical intern trainees at suppliers of place a system that allows us to promptly share information and take countermeasures. As a specific example, in August 2022, after learning that forced labor in the manufacture of rubber gloves in Malaysia had become a problem, we promptly shared the information internally and conducted an investigation into the primary supplier from which SHIONOGI purchased rubber gloves. As a result, it was confirmed that while the product had been purchased in the past, it was not purchased or used at the time the problem was recognized. We will continue to closely monitor such developments in forced labor. Fostering a quality culture COVID-19-related products and confirmed that they did not have technical intern trainees.

III Mechanisms As a corporate group that engages in business activities by investing natural capital, SHIONOGI is deeply aware of the importance of minimizing the negative environmental impacts caused by its business activities as much as possi- ble. We are always conscious of contributing to the conservation of the natural environment and the realization of a sustainable society by efficiently using natural capital such as energy and water and purchased raw materials, providing pharmaceuticals and services, and appropriately man- Environmental and Health and Safety (EHS) initiatives throughout the Group. In fiscal 2022, we revised the SHIONOGI Group EHS Policy and established the SHIONOGI Group EHS Code of Conduct, clarified SHIONOGI's policy on the environment and the governance system to ensure its viability, and spec- ified concrete actions to promote EHS activities. In addition, in response to the TCFD recommendations that we endorsed in March 2022, we identified climate change risks Committee as the supervisor in charge of EHS. In total, the decisions of each committee, which meet at least four times a year, are reported to the President, and matters that need to be consulted by a higher-level deliberative body are submitted to the Corporate Executive Management Meeting in advance and an institutional decision such as a resolution of the Board of Directors is obtained. In this way, we have put into place a system to enable more in-depth discussion. 4°C scenario: Average temperature increases by 4°C in 2100 compared to the Industrial Revolution Reference climate scenarios: IPCC AR6 SSP3-7.0/SSP5-8.5. etc. Stringent measures (carbon tax, environmental regulations, etc.) are not introduced, and natural disasters become more severe and frequent (a world of consequences) *2 IEA stands for International Energy Agency *3 IPCC stands for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change *4 SSP stands for Shared Socio-economic Pathway Supporting SHIONOGI's Growth aging and treating waste and wastewater generated in the process. With this in mind, we are strengthening and opportunities that affect our business activities and disclosed information such as financial impact assessments. Approaches to risk management and climate change scenario analysis Risks and opportunities Climate change initiatives As part of the medium- to long-term SHIONOGI Group EHS Action Targets, we have set ""reduce greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions"" as an indicator aimed at reducing risks related to climate change. In addition, we have set Science Based Targets (SBT) as greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for fiscal 2030 with the aim of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and obtained approval from the SBT Initiative in June 2021. mainly at major business sites such as SHIONOGI Group plants and research laboratories, and are advancing initiatives to reduce CO2emissions. In addition to the introduction of renewable energy-derived electricity at the CMC Innovation Center in fiscal 2023, the introduction of renewable energy -derived electricity at the Pharmaceutical Research Center was completed ahead of schedule. SHIONOGI has achieved a 100% introduction rate of renewable energy-derived electricity to the main sites of research laboratories. Going forward, We assess risks and opportunities that may have a significant impact on the future business environment, including climate change, as important and likely to occur within the enterprise risk management system, and are steadily implementing countermeasures. The results of SHIONOGI's assessment of climate change-related risks and opportunities based on scenario analysis conducted in fiscal 2022 are shown in the table on the next page. We have identified three risks and opportunities arising from climate change, which have a relatively large financial impact: (1) introduction of carbon pricing, (2) impacts on raw materials procurement due to localized extreme weather and temperature rises, and (3) sea level rise. Estimates made at the time of the assessment confirm that even if all identified risks and opportunities were to materi- alize, the negative financial impact on core operating profit, which had been targeted for 2030, the final year of the medium-term management plan STS2030, would be only 80 Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

Therefore, we will carry out medium- to long-term activities to reduce SHIONOGI's greenhouse gas emissions Pricing and mitigate risks. Impacts on Raw As the population of horseshoe crabs decreases due to climate change, it will not be possible to procure lysate reagents made from their blood components Materials Procurement and quality tests will not be possible, and the worst case scenario is assumed to be the suspension of shipments of some main pharmaceuticals. However, due to Localized Extreme horseshoe crab conservation activities are being carried out on the reagent manufacturer's side, or even if it becomes difficult to procure lysate reagents, Weather and there are alternative reagents using genetically modified proteins. Therefore, although the long-term possibility cannot be ruled out, we judge that the Temperature Rises probability of risk occurring in 2030 is extremely low at this time, and we accept this risk. The long-term trend of sea level rise due to climate change is unquestionable, and we assume that the worst case is the possibility that it will adversely Sea Level Rise affect the operations of some of SHIONOGI's major sites located in particularly low lying areas. However, the average sea level rise along the Japan coast is projected to be less than 0.2 m from 2031 to 2050. Therefore, although the long-term possibility cannot be ruled out, we judge that the probability of risk occurring in 2030 is extremely low at this time, and we accept this risk.

Integrated Report 2023 83 IIIMechanisms Supporting SHIONOGI's Growth Special Feature 2Dialogue between President Isao Teshirogi and Professor Kunio Ito Facilitated by Ms. Yoshiko Sato What Constitutes a Next-Generation Leader? President Teshirogi sat down with Professor Ito to discuss perspectives he believes are necessary for management and outside directors in order for the Company to implement management with effective governance. Facilitator Yoshiko Sato Executive Managing Director and Chief Researcher, Japan Investor Relations Association Isao Teshirogi, Ph.D. Kunio Ito Representative Director, President and CEO, Director, Center for CFO Education and Research, Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Hitotsubashi University Now that the effectiveness of the Board of Directors has increased and the Nomination Advisory Committee has begun to function, there is no need to set a scheduled term of office if the Company's governance is working correctly. Basically, I think that a long term of office as a president is good. However, the Company must ensure that this does not negatively affect self-discipline. If the president is such person who can absorb new knowledge, experience, and surprises, such as serving as an outside director of another company, and transform in response to changes in the environment through re-skilling, I believe that the benefits of having him or her work for a long time will outweigh any negatives. In order for the president to become more self-aware objectively, constructive dialogue with the Nomination Advisory Committee is important. SatoAre there people at SHIONOGI originally from outside the Company who can talk frankly about the presi- dent's ongoing tenure? TeshirogiI always receive frank opinions from outside direc- tors. The Nomination Advisory Committee begins with the question of whether or not to allow the president to renew his or her term of office. At least once a year, I receive advice outside director. Investors have come to want it too. SatoHow do you think the Board of Directors of SHIONOGI has changed, including its diversity? TeshirogiAlthough SHIONOGI has chosen to be a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board, there are almost no barriers between outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members and Directors, and they speak from the same standing. At the General Meeting of Shareholders in June 2023, the Company increased the number of outside directors by one, and the ratio of internal and external directors is currently 2:4, and 4:7 including the Audit & Supervisory Board members. In the future, I think the Company can increase the number of women and non-Japanese nationals serving as outside direc- tors. As a representative of business execution, the head of each Business Unit participates in the Board of Directors as an observer. This includes a manager who is a foreign national, but he understands Japanese even if he speaks in English, so he does not feel a language barrier at these meetings. If this kind of communication is possible, I think that outside officers who are foreign nationals will function sufficiently. III Mechanisms SatoTo achieve sustainable growth, the Company will need to develop human resources with leadership skills. What are your thoughts on sustainable succession planning for the president and other executive positions, who are leading SHIONOGI forward? TeshirogiSince it is difficult for people to make decisions 100% objectively based on their own thoughts, and it is not possible for me alone to decide what kind of human resources to promote when considering the future of the Company, we have established the Nomination Advisory Committee composed mainly of outside officers. SHIONOGI established the position of Associate Corporate Officer, one rank below executive officer, two years ago. Appointments to this position are mainly for organization heads including not only those who have worked their way up the corporate lad- der, but also those hired mid-career. Outside officers have the opportunity to talk with Associate Corporate Officers at least twice a year so that they can see if Associate Corporate Officers are suitable as the next corporate officers. Although it is difficult to fully understand them with only limited opportunities, we believe that it is important to continue the selection process until the end, referring to both internal and external evaluations, as a process for selecting human resources who will lead SHIONOGI in the future. ItoAs President Teshirogi said, people inside the Company are familiar with these candidates because they are looking at them through a lens at a close distance. The role of outside officers is to look at candidates' qualifications from a distance based on their expertise. Having both close and far evaluations increases the probability of selecting the most suitable human resources to lead SHIONOGI in the future. TeshirogiIn today's rapidly changing and dynamic environ- ment, it is difficult to determine when to change over top management. I myself have already been president for 16 years, but it generally takes more than 10 years to research and develop pharmaceuticals. When my predecessor, Shiono, handed over the reins to me, he said, ""If you only serve a short term of office, you will only look at the short term and not be able to make management decisions from a long- term perspective."" There are benefits to serving as president for a prolonged period of time, assuming that compliance and integrity are maintained. It takes about two years just to fully understand the entire company, so it is difficult to be judged by a short term of office such as three years. ItoThe timing of when to change over top management is a difficult question. In the past in Japan, it was implicitly thought that if an executive's term of office were limited to four or six years, they could not damage corporate value irreparably even if there were issues in their management. from people outside the company about the positives and negatives of the president's tenure, and then I will try to fix the negative. If there is a majority of opinions consider the president no longer fit for duty, dialogue will be held to select the next president from among the candidates at that time.ItoIn that respect, outside directors who are members of the Nomination Advisory Committee are placed in a sensitive position. This may be a self-important way to put it, but members of the Nomination Advisory Committee also need to refine themselves. If they do not notice changes in the environment and evaluate the current president only according to old standards, the evaluation will be distorted. Outside directors also need to undergo reskilling. TeshirogiYou are right. It will be difficult for outside directors to continue to serve if they do not have other jobs. Based on my own experience, I would like to recommend that current CEOs be in charge of one or two outside directors. ItoEven the same director can take a different stance depending on a position inside or outside the company. It is a great idea for the president or executive vice president to have the experience of standing on the other side. In the past, investors have asked if the president has that kind of time, but I think they will understand if the president contributes to the sustainable growth of the company by having valuable experiences otherwise not possible before as an SatoProfessor Ito, what is your ideal board of directors' style? ItoTo increase the number of outside officers, and more specifically to increase diversity, it is wonderful to have foreign nationals join the Board of Directors. However, it is also necessary to be aware of the continuity of discussions and avoid sudden changes, such as replacing three to four directors at a time. The purpose is to compensate for any shortfall in skills, and I doubt whether simply addressing diversity such as nationality and increasing the number of directors will increase board effectiveness. TeshirogiAfter the official board meeting, we can obtain helpful opinions by talking honestly during informal off-site meetings. At SHIONOGI we hold informal meetings called the ""outside officer and the president opinion exchange meet- ings"" four times a year involving outside officers and myself.ItoThat's right. It is difficult for people in the company to give advice and change the way of thinking of top manage- ment. If people outside the company feel that top management is open to listening to the opinions of people outside the company, like President Teshirogi, I think a good cycle will be created in which people outside the company will give more advice. SatoThank you for your time today. Supporting SHIONOGI's Growth 84 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2023 85 IIIMechanisms Supporting SHIONOGI's Growth Message from the Chairperson of the Board Keiichi Ando Independent Outside Director Career History After graduating from the Faculty of Economics at The University of Tokyo, Ando joined Sumitomo Bank Limited (now Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation). He worked his way up to Representative Director and Deputy President of the Bank and then moved on to become Representative Director, President and CEO of New Kansai International Airport Company, Ltd. Ando also served as an outside director of the Company for seven years from 2016. Currently, he is an outside director of Tsubakimoto Chain Co. and an outside director of DAIHEN Corporation. In addition to practical experience as an executive of a financial institution and a wide range of knowledge in treasury and finance, as the CEO of an operating company he transformed business models and formulated and promoted growth strategies to grow the company's business value. Corporate Governance Material IssueStrengthen governance To ensure business execution based on appropriate management decisions, SHIONOGI has strengthened the monitoring function of the Board of Directors, which deliberates on matters mainly relating to the Company's corporate philosophy, business plans, and important matters concerning business execution, by tapping into the management experience and professional knowledge of outside directors and outside auditors. This has resulted in the establishment of a framework in which each executive organization ascertains the progress of business execution related to matters for which a management decision was made and reports to the Corporate Executive Management Meeting, the Board of Directors, etc., on a timely basis. SHIONOGI has opted to be a company with a board of corporate auditors to ensure such duties are performed in a legally compliant and smooth manner by linking the Board of Directors' oversight function, the corporate auditors' audit function, and business audits by the Internal Control Department. Features of SHIONOGI's corporate governance As chairperson of the Board, how do you evaluate SHIONOGI's governance and challenges? The Company has ensured a high level of corporate gover- nance, including by strengthening supervisory functions, separating business execution, pursuing management transparency, undertaking prompt and bold decision-mak- ing, and evaluating the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. In FY2022, the Company was able to meet the expectations of society by obtaining emergency approval for the COVlD-19 therapeutic drugXocovaand applying for manufacturing and marketing approval of a COVID-19 preventive vaccine. However, the environment surrounding the pharmaceutical industry is becoming increasingly severe. To continue achieving sustainable growth and fur- What are your impressions of the Associate Corporate Officer position established two years ago? Does it pose any challenges? Strengthening management personnel and succession planning are the most critical issues for management. With regard to human resources who will lead the next genera- tion, the Company is working to identify candidates for management personnel through explanations at the Board meetings and direct discussions and interviews at informal meetings of Associate Corporate Officers, and the Board of Directors receives reports on the status of human resource development and the human resource portfolio, and focuses on strengthening and developing strategic human resources. SHIONOGI incorporates the perspectives of its four groups of stakeholders-customers, society, shareholders and investors, and employees-in maintaining transparent and proper business management that treats its stakeholders fairly and is responsive to the expectations of society. SHIONOGI has no plans to mechanically comply with all the items contained in the Corporate Governance Code. It is important that we always strive for the best compliance system, clearly express our thoughts about points with which we will not comply, and thoroughly discuss any differences of opinion with outsiders. To further strengthen our framework in view of the progress in our business development, SHIONOGI is building the necessary framework from the standpoint of diversity and such factors as expertise and experience. We have appointed two female directors and one female auditor, as well as directors and auditors with a wide diversity of skills and age groups. A majority of SHIONOGI's directors and auditors are independent and outside officers, which increases the transparency of our management. Also, based on our Disclosure Policy, we continue to disclose our corporate information to all of our stakeholders in a fair, timely, and appropriate manner. III Mechanisms ther increase corporate value, the Company's top priority should be the establishment of growth drivers, such as new businesses and promising drug discovery for medium- to long-term growth. As an outside director serving on the Board of Directors, I recognize that it is increasingly important to actively commit to its business and growth strategies from various angles with a medium- to long-term perspective. What skills and talent should directors have to address these challenges? Looking at the Company's future direction, which includes transformation into a Health as a Service (HaaS) company and expansion of overseas business, directors will need to analyze and recognize the management and business risks that the Company faces over the medium to long term, and thoroughly discuss growth strategies, business model trans- formation, and progress in anticipation of future changes in the environment. Therefore, it is important for human resources with diverse management experience, expertise, and international business experience to engage in free and vigorous discussions from a broad perspective based on their different perspectives and knowledge. In addition, as part of its corporate social responsibilities, the Company is required to manage business strategies, including contributing to the realization of a sustainable society, so I recognize that further strengthening the management system with a wider range of management personnel is also an issue for the Company's future. As chairperson of the Nomination Advisory Committee, what are your expectations for the future of the Company's human resources? The Board of Directors needs to have human resources who are fully aware of the management and business risks that the Company faces, and who can boldly take on the challenge of transforming the business model in response to changes in the environment. In particular, the pharmaceutical industry faces long-term and difficult issues such as medium- to long-term business strategies, creation of promising pipelines, and responses to patent cliffs, so a high level of management and execution skills are required. In order to transform into a HaaS company, I anticipate that the Company will build and develop a human resource portfolio that matches growth and strategic fields, strengthen its R&D capabilities (human resources), and acquire highly skilled human resources.

Opinion exchange meetings are convened with outside directors, all of the corporate auditors, and the Representative Director, President and CEO in attendance, and topics for discussion include recent trends in the health- care industry and Company business, as well as plans for executive training and the status of that training. In addition, four rounds of dialogues were held between outside directors and associate corporate officers who are prospective executive officer candidates. In fiscal 2022, the number of participants, the format and frequency of the meetings were adjusted with the aim of deepening discussions, reflecting requests from outside directors based on the previous year's results. 8Outside officer information exchange/study sessions In order to deepen understanding of SHIONOGI's business, the Standing Corporate Auditor hosts the outside officer information exchange and study sessions, which are attended by outside offi- cers and senior management of SHIONOGI.

In addition, four members of the board are independent outside directors, all of whom are aware of SHIONOGI's corporate responsibility, contributing to greater transparency in management. The Board of Directors is chaired by an independent outside director and in principle held once a month. Board of Auditors /Board of Auditors meeting To ensure that the directors and each organization in SHIONOGI conduct their duties in a legally compliant and appropriate manner, the Company has established systems to enable members of the Board of Auditors and the Internal Control Department, which is responsible for conducting internal audits, to carry out audits and exchange opinions with the representative directors to take necessary measures. The Board of Auditors consists of two standing members and three outside auditors. The members of the Board of Auditors attend meetings of key management bodies, such as the Board of Directors and the Corporate Executive Management Meeting, providing their opinions as necessary. Also, in accordance with corporate auditing standards, members of the Board of Business Supervisory Unit, Supply Supervisory Unit, and Corporate Supervisory Unit.

Results of fiscal 2021 evaluation Response and initiative status in fiscal 2022 A summary of the results of the analysis and evaluation of the overall effectiveness of the Board of Directors for fiscal 2022 is as follows: III Mechanisms Supporting Example 2 Shionogi Pharma Co., Ltd.'s efforts to improve quality issues Items reported and resolved at the Board of Directors Main discussions Results of fiscal 2022 evaluation While the necessary structure is in place in terms of diversity and various factors including expertise and experi- ence, the need to appoint female directors and directors with expertise in overseas business was identified as an issue for the future in terms of further diversity in light of the expansion and transformation of business. In the interest of succession, the need was also mentioned for human resource development through the President's Management Seminar and the associate corporate officer system, as well as further opportunities for dialogue between outside officers and human resources who will become the next batch of corporate officers. Regarding discussions at the Board of Directors, progress reports for the STS2030 medium-term business plan and enhancement of sustainability discussions were well-received. However, a number of comments also called for a revision of the medium-term business plan toward growth in the post-pandemic era in light of the launch of the SHIONOGI's Growth The following proposal from the executive side was approved by resolution.

In addition, the SHIONOGI has also experienced incidents that, if left unchecked, could have developed into serious problems. It is based on this premise and a field investigation by Shionogi Pharma, a manufacturing group, that we propose work to improve quality issues at said subsidiary by addressing aging facilities, building an organizational culture, strengthening organizational man- agement, and enhancing production management."" ance. In addition, as SHIONOGI becomes more globalized, it will be subject to an increasing number of inspections and other actions outside of Japan from authorities in various countries where it does business, so it is necessary to plan investments with an eye to the future. Response in fiscal 2023 In addition to the appropriate control of the items and time for deliberation at meetings of the Board of Directors, the implementation of preliminary briefings to stimulate discussion, improvement of presentation content, and an atmosphere conducive to free and vigorous discussion and exchange of opinions received strong evaluations. Opinions toward further improvement included greater information provision in order to enhance discussions of the Board of Directors, as well as considerations for a support system for the board. Agenda items to be submitted to the Board of Directors will continue to be enhanced and a system and operations will be developed in order to facilitate the vigorous discussion necessary for SHIONOGI's sustainable growth. Our responses toward this end are as follows. 90 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2023 91 IIIMechanisms Supporting SHIONOGI's Growth Corporate Governance Cross-shareholdings Cross-shareholdings are reviewed annually by the Board of Directors to determine whether continued holding presents a business rationale. In light of the relationship with the cost of capital, SHIONOGI maintains such cross-shareholdings only when they are deemed to enhance SHIONOGI's corporate value and contribute to sustainable growth. Otherwise, we proceed with sequential sell-offs in consideration of stock prices and market trends. In fiscal 2022, the number of listed stocks held increased to 20 due to IPOs.

For medium-termperformance-linked stock compensation in particular, the performance evaluation will be based on the degree of achievement in fiscal 2022 for the portion to be granted in the three years from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022 during the STS2030 Phase 1 period (fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2024) to determine the ratio of lifting the transfer restriction (100% to 0%). Performance evaluations use such quantitative indicators as revenue, overseas net sales, core operating profit, ROE and the ranking in total shareholder return (TSR) among 12 industry peers including SHIONOGI (rel- ative TSR) and also incorporate the status of sustainability compliance, and the status of initiatives associated with COVID-19. For fiscal 2022, we have decided to set the ratio of lifting the transfer restriction at 80% after deliberation and reflection by the Compensation Advisory Committee based on an overall assessment of external evaluations on ESG, status of compliance, and the results of activities related to COVID-19, companies that have a similar business size to SHIONOGI and are included among the relevant business types and catego- ries. The Board of Directors, in respect of the recommendations given by the Compensation Advisory Committee, determines the details of the remuneration system, etc. so that the ratio of remuneration by type is in line with the recom- mendations. The policy for determination thereof is set in accordance with the separately defined ""Policy for Determination of Details of Individual Remuneration, etc. for Directors"" in our Corporate Governance Report p.12*2. In addi- tion, pursuant to the resolution at the Board of Directors meeting held on February 22, 2021, it is considered appropriate that base remuneration and individual bonus amounts, etc. are evaluated and determined by a person who bears the ultimate management responsibility, and thus, such evaluation and determination are entrusted to the Representative Director, President and CEO.

Using math critically allows us to consider complex personal and socio-political issues, such as health, the economy and the environment, says Professor Kim Beswick, Director of the Gonski Institute and Head of the School of Education at UNSW.""Mathematical practices are fundamental to navigating our everyday lives. Math helps us make well-founded judgements about all sorts of [day-to-day] things, including food, distance and time, costs, loans and sports, all of which need to be considered in the context of other considerations and priorities,"" she says. ""Few decisions are purely mathematical; they have individual and societal impacts beyond themaththat also need to be considered.""With today's world characterized by rapid change, it's important we equip children to engage with its challenges, she says.""We constantly hear data about different elements of our lives, from accelerating rates of global warming to the prevalence of vaping and its health risks,"" she says.""If people don't understand the math, or they're not confident in it, they can't engage sensibly in conversations about what might or might not be effective [interventions] or understand the degree of [their] personal risk.""Prof. Beswick's research examines the beliefs and knowledge underpinning math teaching, particularly in relation to teachers' expectations of and aspirations for their students. A math teacher for more than 13 years, she's committed to enhancing the quality of math education for all students.Teaching children critical mathematical thinking lays the foundation for sound decision-making andproblem-solving, she says. Critical mathematical thinking is using math techniques and reasoning across broad contexts.""It's a really powerful way of describing, thinking about and approaching the world, of finding patterns and forecasting different outcomes,"" she says. ""It's key to finding solutions to many existing and emerging national and international challenges, including how to respond to technological, environmental, economic and social change.""Developing the capacity to reflect on the consequences of proposed solutions—social and ethical—is a key feature, she says. ""For example, when we asked a class of high school students in Brisbane to consider whether or not residents of flood-affected areas should take up the government's offer to buy back their properties, they could see, mathematically, that the buy back was good deal, but realized there were other considerations,"" she says.""Can I find somewhere to buy that is not flood-prone and still close enough to work? How will it affect social networks? What childcare and school options are available in an area I could move to? These things affectdifferent individualsdifferently so there is not one right answer.""Critical mathematical thinking encourages children to think about the way information is presented or framed. ""Of course, real life is messier than math problems, but critical mathematical thinking encourages kids to consider the assumptions made and their limitations—that's the critical thinking part,"" she says.""It encourages them to ask the right questions. Do I have all the information I need to understand this? What don't I know? What should I ask? How can I find out that other information? What other factors should I consider? It's those sorts of questions. Who's got a vested interest in this story I just read in the newspaper?""And while it promotes a workforce supported by STEM capabilities, it's more than that, she says. ""[Developing your critical math thinking] gives you more agency in the world. You can make better arguments. You can understand your medical treatment, or what your bank manager is telling you, what a proposed government policy might mean for you and for others,"" she says.""And you can ask more searching questions. It's what helps you find employment and engage in society as an informed citizen. It makes learning math meaningful—something you can do to have a positive influence in the world, not simply for academic purposes.""Math teaching needs to be about more than skills and routine problemsThe results ofinternational student assessmentprograms, such as the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), indicate that Australian students find mathematical reasoning difficult. ""This highlights the urgent need to address teaching practices that promote students' critical math thinking within Australian schools,"" says Prof. Beswick.""What happens way too often is that students learn the routine algorithmic material—they learn the processes that get the right answers, they can solve equations, for example—but often when it comes to some real-life problem, they avoid math. It is the very last resort. They don't have the depth of understanding that supports confidence.""It's important that math is taught in such a way that children understand its first principles ""to make sure they can make sense of the calculation, as well as knowing how to do the calculation, and that will help them make sense of the world"", she says.""There are great teachers out there who do just that, but it doesn't happen nearly enough. International studies that ask students about what goes on in the classrooms depict a very traditional approach to lessons in Australia.""The issue is exacerbated by the current teacher shortage that means many teachers are teaching out of area, she says. Typically, in Australian classrooms, math classes are characterized by studying lots of short problems, ""whereas other countries, such as Japan, tend to do fewer problems but spend longer on them"", she says.""Moving in that direction would be useful so kids can really delve into the problem, and what's going on there, and make sense of it for themselves."" A good teacher can guide in-class discussion about an interesting problem in such a way that children don't waste time following dead ends and get frustrated, she says. ""They develop deeper insights and make connections among math ideas and between those ideas and the ways they can be used.""Engaging with more complicated problems can support critical mathematical thinkingProf. Beswick is partnering with a team of national and international experts on an Australia Research Council (ARC) project DP220101015, 'Enabling students' critical mathematical thinking', which will generate new insights into teaching practices that can promote or inhibit students' development of critical mathematical thinking.Introducing children to new mathematical concepts through more complicated problems—""the good stuff""—without so many broken down steps, rather than starting with easier problems and getting progressively more complex, is one possible approach, she says.""Focusing only on the math, separate from its applications, results in students thinking math is irrelevant and, for too many, not something they want to pursue.""You could teach or reinforce the necessary tools along the way, she says. ""It means that students might spend a whole lesson on one problem or issue or maybe longer. But they will have learned [the concepts involved] in a much deeper way. Practicing skills is important but when students understand the relevant concepts less is needed.""Children are then building on their understanding of math beyond the utilitarian, she says. ""It is about [supporting critical] thinking, not just crunching through processes—doing what a calculator can do—and I think that's what makes math interesting,"" she says.""And that's what will inspire more kids to study math for longer which would also help our teacher shortage. It would certainly give us a more mathematically capable citizenry—something that we desperately need.""Beliefs around student capability can influence teachers' approachesTeachers' beliefs aroundstudentcapability also affects their approach to teaching, including their likelihood to teach in a way that fosters critical math thinking, she says.""People close doors to students … Too often they get classified rather than taught. The answer is to move them down a level rather than help them make up what they might have missed or explain things another way.""Prof. Beswick grew up in a farming community in Tasmania in which not many students went on to university. She experienced firsthand the negative bias associated with teachers' expectations as well as the positive impact of engaged teaching.In senior secondary school, she elected to take the most demanding math subject without the necessary pre-requisites. Her math teacher worked with her for a lunchtime every week to help her understand the concepts that didn't make sense to her.""He was so patient with me … I would take a list of questions to him, and he would work through them all,"" she says. ""I remember the lesson where he explained the limit theorem in calculus. And he did it so well, it struck a chord with me. I just thought that is beautiful. I want to do math forever.""The experience changed her career trajectory and invoked a lifelong passion. And while not all math has real-world relevance, teaching the subject should include the development of critical thinking.""I'd be the first to say there is also value in learning pure math,"" she says. ""Pure math, like art or music, is a part of our cultural heritage—it can be a thing of beauty—and not everyone's going to enjoy it or appreciate it, but they should be given the opportunity to access it as part of our culture. For most students, seeing the way math can be used to help individual and societal decision-making will be what inspires them to study the subject.""Provided byUniversity of New South WalesCitation: Critical mathematical thinking skills create more engaged citizens, says expert (2023, November 2) retrieved 3 November 2023 ","['australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'japan']",gb,False,False

Four months on, Ukrainians are still facing water shortages but say they are determined to overcome the destruction. When Svitlana Kridiner heard about the dam collapse, she knew it was only a matter of time before her village would be flooded. In the end it took two days for the water to reach her. It arrived at around 17:00 on 8 June. ""We packed quickly. We took our livestock - cows, dogs, ducklings - and our equipment: milking kits and a generator,"" she says. ""We had to leave all our other possessions behind, they were all lost."" The 52-year-old farmer and her husband Vasyl had devoted their lives to their herd of two dozen cows, which they had raised from calves, and did everything they could to save them. It took just five more hours for the water to engulf their whole farm. Their village, Afanasiivka, is 70km (45 miles) north of the dam and there are signs of damage everywhere. Svitlana shows us water marks inside a barn, close to the ceiling, and explains that most of the hay she and her husband had prepared to feed their cows over the winter was destroyed. So was their other animal feed. ""The water rose by six metres, but at least the farm building survived,"" she says. ""Only the floor got washed away but the walls are still standing."" On top of this, Svitlana's village is near the front line, and like many of the flood-hit areas is contaminated with ammunition. She shows us a rocket, stuck in the ground in one of her hay meadows. ""My husband has to mow around it,"" she says. The Ukrainian government is offering her compensation for the flood damage, although she says the 5,000 Ukrainian hryvnia offered, equivalent to $135 or £110, is nowhere near enough to repair everything. Somehow, she's not disheartened. ""Maybe we will take out another loan, we will mow some hay for the cows or buy some more. We will make it, rest assured."" Her optimism is shared by another farmer we meet, Vadym Sheremet, who shows us round the ruins of his home in the village of Pavlo-Marianivka, 10km (six miles) away. ""Here we had a fireplace, where our family gathered,"" says the 52-year-old, pointing to a pile of bricks and chimney debris. ""It was such a happy time,"" he trails off, remembering the old days. The water reached the roof of his house and destroyed his crops. Before the flood he grew wheat, barley and sunflowers. And this isn't the first time he has had to start again. Vadym's village was under Russian occupation for much of 2022. ""Last autumn we had 250 hectares of grain, ready to harvest. Russians burnt it all. That was the first blow,"" he says. ""Then spring 2023 came. We gave it our all and sowed, however hard it was. Then the water came. We were knocked down once again."" The impact of the dam explosion is so huge that it is described as ""one of the biggest human-caused disasters of our time"", in a report by US research institute, the Wilson Centre. It also says that ""more than one million hectares of land in three southern oblasts of Ukraine - Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk - will be unusable for the next three to five years for lack of a water supply"". Damage worth an estimated $2bn (£1.6bn) was caused by the breach, excluding the cost of rebuilding it, according to Ukrainian authorities. They said more than two-thirds of the affected area was in Russian-occupied territory where the flooding was worse because the bank on that side of the river is lower. Watch on iPlayer: After Kakhovka The Kakhovka dam held back a vast reservoir that supplied water to irrigate farms as well as provided drinking water. A report by the United Nations warns that there is unlikely to be enough rain to water farmers' crops, so people have been digging new wells and laying water supply lines with help from the authorities and aid groups. With help from volunteers, Vadym is building a new house, ploughing his fields to prepare for the season ahead and plans to lay a new water supply to help his community. ""Everything will work out,"" says Vadim. ""Life is wonderful. You can give in or become stronger."" Two days after we left Vadym's village he received some devastating news. His 20-year-old son, Ivan, was killed by an explosive by the side of a road, not far from his home. Vadim believes it was a Russian munition, although there is no way to confirm this at the moment. Since Russia's invasion, Ukraine has become one of the most heavily mined countries in the world, according to the United Nations. The head of the Red Cross's weapon contamination unit, Erik Tollefsen, says the dam disaster dislodged mines, exacerbating the problem. ""We knew where the hazards were. Now we don't. All we know is that they are somewhere downstream,"" he told the AFP news agency. Source: Ukrainian government / UN estimates Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for the destruction of the dam. Two days after it started to burst, a Norwegian agency analysed seismic signals from a regional station in Romania, which indicated an explosion at the same time the dam collapse was registered. Experts with the international human rights law firm Global Rights Compliance, which is implementing Western-backed efforts to support accountability for atrocities in Ukraine, visited the Kherson region from 10 to 11 June with Ukraine's prosecutor general and a team from the International Criminal Court. The group concluded it was ""highly likely"" that Russia was behind the attack. Despite everything that has happened, Vadym is determined to rebuild his life and his farm. He was too upset to talk straight after Ivan's death but eventually he called us from his courtyard, sitting with his back against his tractor. ""My son was someone who could do anything,"" he said. And he vowed to keep strong for Ivan. ""We have to be strong. We have to live. We will make it,"" he says. ""We are good people who deserve to live in a peaceful and flourishing Ukraine.""","['ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'portugal', 'us', 'russia', 'russia', 'russia', 'romania']",gb,False,False

According to an Oct. 10announcement, Google showcased several new projects and expansions demonstrating how technology can empower systemic change to combat climate change globally during its Sustainable with Google event on October 10. In the transportation sector, a significant contributor to emissions, Google announced expanding its Project Green Light traffic optimization initiative. The project usesartificial intelligence(AI) to analyze traffic patterns and optimize traffic light timing to reduce stop-and-go driving. By creating “green waves” where cars can drive through multiple coordinated intersections without stopping, Green Light aims to cut emissions from acceleration and braking. Early data from Green Light’s 70 optimized intersections in 12 global cities shows the potential to reduce stops by 30% and lower carbon emissions at intersections by 10%. With 30 million potential car trips impacted per month, scaled adoption could significantly reduce urban transportation emissions. Google plans Green Light expansions to more cities worldwide this year. Fuel-efficient routing now covers India and Indonesia,helping citizens reduce gas usage. In France, Google Maps will soon display walking and transit routes alongside driving to highlight greener choices. Google’s goal is to influence over 1 billion people worldwide to choose more sustainable travel through its products. Google also highlighted projects focused on transitioning global energy usage to renewable sources. Updates to Google Search will provide more information on home renewable heating and cooling to educate consumers. Google is also improving access to AI-powered grid planning tools for utilities, like Project Tapestry in Chile. Using robust modeling of factors like weather disruptions, these tools can aid the complex process of transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy generation. Finally, Google discussed leveraging its AI capabilities to help communities adapt to intensifying climate change impacts. Flood forecasting on Google’s Flood Hub platform now covers the U.S. and Canada, providing advanced warning to over 12 million residents. A new wildfire spread prediction model developed with the U.S. Forest Service will provide one of the first AI-powered upgrades to wildfire simulation in 50 years. Google is also expanding its urban tree canopy and cool roof mapping to thousands of cities to support heat mitigation planning. According to Google parent company Alphabet’s CEO Sundar Pichai, the company aims to continue developing insights and tools to help individuals, cities, and organizations to make progress toward a carbon-free future. With climate change an urgent “moonshot” challenge, expanding access to climate-focused technologies will be key to enabling the requirement of global-scale emission reductions.

But Israel’s gains have limits too. As reports of Hamas fighters attacking southern Israel last Saturday flooded phones and television sets around the world, Kenyan President William Ruto took to X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. “Kenya joins the rest of the world in solidarity with the State of Israel and unequivocally condemns terrorism and attacks on innocent civilians in the country,” he wrote. “There exists no justification whatsoever for terrorism, which constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.” “The international community must mobilise to bring the perpetrators, organisers, financiers, sponsors, supporters and enablers of these reprehensible criminal acts of terrorism to account and speedily bring them to justice.” It was an explicit endorsement of Israel’s position and – some would argue – the response that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has since unleashed on the Gaza Strip, with a bombing campaign that haskilled more than 1,900 people. And it was a social media post that underscored Israel’s growing influence in Africa. As the death toll from the war mounts, African governments are wading into heated debates surrounding the conflict – with the continent split, as different nations take opposing sides. Authorities in South Africa blamed the escalation on Israel’s illegal occupation and desecration of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, as well as sacred Christian sites, in a statement on Sunday. A top official, Zane Dangor, told local news channel eNCA that Hamas’s bloody attack, while not a solution, was unsurprising and that the conflict would not stop “until the occupation ends”. Algeria declared “full solidarity with Palestine” early on in the war. The African Union Commission under Moussa Mahamat Faki, while expressing concern over the violence, has blamed the “denial of the fundamental rights of the Palestinians” and called for a two-state solution. But Kenya, Zambia, Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are among other African nations that have aligned with Israel’s position. So why is a continent that suffered the worst ravages of colonialism and racism for centuries and that has historically, for the most part, supported Palestine, split now? The short answer:Africa’s divisions highlight each government’s attempt to compartmentalise their interests, experts say, and underline some countries’ strengthening ties with Israel. On the one hand, there are deep-rooted ties with the Palestinian movement; on the other, the offer of cutting-edge technology, military assistance and aid from Israel. Which wins out could determine how Africa tilts if this conflict drags on – and in the future. African countries shedding the pain of brutal colonial rule in the 1960s were cold to a newly formed Israel and were sympathetic to the struggle of Palestinians uprooted from their land and homes in 1948. Following theOctober War of 1973, the continental bloc, then the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) severed ties with Israel. Algeria has been a leading critic of Israel on the continent – even as itsrivalMorocco’s relations with Israel have blossomed after they agreed to normalise ties in 2020. Zine Labidine Ghebouli, a researcher with the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) traces some of Algeria’s sentiments to the 1988 Palestinian Declaration of Independence in Algiers and even further back to Algeria’s history under French colonialism. “The Algeria-Palestine relationship is very historic and emotional,” Ghebouli told Al Jazeera, adding that Islam as a common religion solidifies those ties. “We were occupied by France, and this history of brutality is similar. “On my social media feed right now it’s all about solidarity with Palestine at the moment.” But post-apartheid South Africa has perhaps been Palestine’s most staunch supporter on the continent, with Nelson Mandela famously drawing parallels between the struggle of Black South Africans against white rule and of Palestinians against Israel’s occupation. Many human rights groups have subsequently also made that comparison. In July 2022, South African Foreign MinisterNaledi Pandor calledon the United Nations to declare Israel an “apartheid state”. Amid Russia’s war on Ukraine, as Western pressure grew on South Africa and other nations in Africa and Asia to condemn Moscow’s actions,Pandor pushed back, asking why Western capitals weren’t willing to apply the same principles of international law when it came to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian lands. Still, that vocal diplomatic support for Palestine masks a more complex relationship between African nations and Israel – one that has rapidly grown in recent years, reshaping the continent’s approach to the Middle East. After the 1973 war, only a handful of African nations retained relations with Israel, while most broke ties. Yet, today, that tide has turned dramatically: 44 of 54Africancountries recognise Israel’s statehood, and close to 30 have opened embassies or consulates in Tel Aviv. Israel’s widely recognised prowess in agriculture has helped its cause – at a time when many African countries battle drought, floods and extreme weather phenomena at increasing frequencies. A fifth of Africa’s population is undernourished. “Israel’s role as one of the world’s leaders in agricultural technologies is a very attractive incentive for African countries battling insecurity and for economies with arid and semi-arid lands,” Tighisti Amare, deputy director of the Africa Programme at the London-based Chatham House think tank said. “As such, many African countries have chosen to exercise their agency and separate economic interests from political positions in international fora,” she added. But it’s not just agriculture. Trade and security interests too have made many African countries warm up to Israel, said Alhadji Bouba Nouhou, a lecturer at the University of Bordeaux. A key turning point came in 1978, with the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel. “Things really started to change following the Camp David agreements,” Nouhou told Al Jazeera. With a major Arab country signing a peace deal with Israel, many African nations decided it made little sense for them to stay away. That trend gained more momentum after the Oslo Accords of 1993 – a period that also marked the demise of the apartheid regime in South Africa, the end of the Cold War, and the promise of rapprochement between Israel and African nations. More recently, the normalisation deals struck with Chad, Morocco and Sudan represent major wins on the continent for Israel. South Africa, one of Israel’s fiercest critics on the continent, is also its biggest trading partner in Africa – by far. In 2021, trade between Israel and Sub-Saharan African countriesreachedover $750m. Israel exports machinery, electronics, and chemicals to the continent. Of that, nearly two-thirds weretradedwith South Africa, followed by Nigeria, with which Israel traded goods worth $129m in 2021. South Africa also trades with Palestine, with Palestinian exports of olive oils and other edibles jumping 34 percent between 2009 and 2021. Yet, Israel also has strong ties with nations beyond trade. For decades, it has pumped millions of dollars in humanitarian aid into Ethiopia. Thousands of Ethiopian Jews have made their way to Israel. Mashav, Israel’s international aid agency, has also flown in Kenyan students for training in agriculture and medicine and trained Senegalese entrepreneurs in management. Meanwhile, in Cameroon, Israeli forces are believed to be propping up longtime ruler Paul Biya by training the BIR, an elite fearsome army unit that answers directly to the president. Israeli media reports have suggested that the country is also training soldiers in multiple African nations. An Africa-Israel summit was scheduled to be held in 2017, although a crisis in the host country Togo led to it being called off. But earlier that year, Netanyahu, speaking to West African leaders at a meeting in Liberia, declared: “Israel is coming back to Africa, and Africa is coming back to Israel.” Despite all of these gains, however, Israel has also continued to face setbacks in Africa. Previous inroads bolstered Aleligne Admasu, Israel’s ambassador to the African Union, to seek Observer Status for Israel in the bloc in 2021. Although the request was granted, Israel’s status wassuspendedthis February, after Algeria and South Africa protested the move. Palestine, on the other hand, has retained AU Observer Status since 2013. So are African governments two-faced about the Israel-Palestine conflict – trading with Israel and strengthening ties with it, while also, in some cases at least, speaking up for Palestine? Experts say that neither their seeming contradiction nor the divisions within Africa on the issue are surprising – and point to the recent split in positions after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. “When the war broke, while Russia’s invasion of a sovereign country was not condoned, a third of African countries chose to remain neutral in the UN vote condemning Russia’s invasion,” Amare of Chatham House reminded. “It is not unusual for this to happen and expectations that African countries will have the same response to a crisis is generally misguided,” she said. In another example, African countries, despite intensifying relations with Israel, voted overwhelmingly against the US decision to open an embassy in disputed Jerusalem in a UN emergency meeting backin 2017. And politics might soon seep into trade relations. While South Africa is the pillar of Israel’s trade with the continent, there is growing pressure from civil society for Pretoria to take a clearer position in favour of Palestine, Muhammed Desai, director of the South African advocacy group Africa4Palestine, told Al Jazeera. “Last year, South Africa’s parliament passed a resolution to downgrade South Africa’s diplomatic relations and embassy in Israel,” Desai said. “As we speak, South Africa does not have an ambassador in Israel,” he pointed out. “As civil society, we are advocating for our government to do more: All relations and trade with Israel should be boycotted, both at a public level but also by the private sector.” If Israel’s deadly bombardment of Gaza continues and is followed by a land invasion, expect such calls to grow.

Unlike most others, Noort had a professional reason to follow the drama.An expert in Earth observation technology, he took part in a research project that used EU funding to set up a flood-alert system in another African country: Kenya.Early warningsNoort had that successful work in mind as he watched the impact of torrential rains in Libya that caused two dams to burst, inundate the coastal city of Derna, destroy entire neighborhoods and kill thousands of people. Survivors have said they received no adequate alert.""Putting an early-warning system in place could have warned people and the number of casualties would have been far lower,"" said Noort, a Dutch native who is an independent consultant on geospatial information applications. ""Although it was a flash flood, it still takes some time to get to the urban area.""The EU project—calledTWIGA—established such an early-warning system with the Kenya Meteorological Department in Narok, a town located in the southwestern part of the country near the capital Nairobi. The initiative wrapped up in July 2022 after more than four years.Narok regularly gets inundated in part because it is located in a basin known as the Great Rift Valley, with a flash flood inFebruary 2022resulting in two deaths and widespread destruction.The alert system relies onsatellite dataand official weather forecasts combined with additional—but relatively inexpensive—weather stations and water-flow measurements of rivers.Residents can subscribe to phone alerts. The system is now being improved in a follow-up project—TEMBO Africa—that started in February 2023 and will include monitoring of smaller rivers.""If you get five or even just two hours of warning, that is valuable,"" said Nick van de Giesen, who ran TWIGA, now leads TEMBO and is a professor of water-resource management at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. ""We are generating information that can be turned into actions.""Flood prediction allows people to move to safety, relocate animals and vehicles and block latrines.Dam flowsMore places in Africa are becoming vulnerable to floods as a result of climate change and urbanization, which has increased the amount of hard surfaces that prevent water absorption by the ground. Inadequate drainage also often plays a role.""The idea now is to roll out aflood-predictionservice throughout Kenya and after that to find partners in other African countries to do the same,"" said Noort.Another part of TWIGA tackled water levels behind dams. It deployed technology for monitoring inflows into reservoirs for hydropower plants in Ghana and Zambia.Water can sometimes reach such heights that dam operators are forced to spill it through sluice gates to drain a reservoir. This can cause flooding downstream. It also wastes potential hydroelectricity.Better management of reservoirs by measuring rainfall and river flow upstream was shown in TWIGA to be a game changer. Knowing how much water is coming allows dam operators to act before an emergency release becomes necessary.""Maybe you could more gradually spill water or—ideally—generate extra electricity by letting the water run through your turbines,"" said van de Giesen.Scientists are working with local partners in Ghana and Zambia to create easy-to-use technology. This should prevent deluges in towns and villages downstream of hydropower dams.""It is better to spill than have the dams washed away, like what happened in Libya,"" said van de Giesen, who has worked onwater projectsas an engineer in West Africa.Seed securitySeed insurance is also being trialed for farmers in Ghana, where asemi-arid climatecontributes to crop losses.Under a planned scheme, growers would pay a little extra when buying seeds in return for compensation in the event there isn't enough rain after they're sown.The key is to tell planters when to sow and know when there has been insufficient rain for germination.""If you have small farmers, with less than two hectares, you cannot send insurance agents to all,"" said van de Giesen.Satellites and rainfall detectors automatically signal when insufficient amounts have fallen.While satellites play a role high up, they are unable to scrutinize rainfall down on the ground for farms.Instead, project scientists have turned to cosmic rays for a helping hand.Fast payoutsSubatomic particles from space—called neutrons—zip around at speeds up to 20,000 kilometers a second on Earth. When there's plenty of rain, the particles bounce off water molecules, slowing them down.The researchers built a kit that can detect this neutron slowdown, which signals rainfall. The system combines this information with satellite images to improve predictions about when an individual farm faces drought.In a drought scenario, a farmer automatically receives seeds in compensation or a payout to buy more if needed.""A big innovation here is that we're going to be really fast with paying out,"" said van de Giesen.A Ghanaian insurance group plans to make the product available to local insurers and banks in 2024.""This is really about anchoring satellite observations to measurements on the ground,"" said van de Giesen.","['kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'ghana', 'ghana', 'ghana', 'ghana', 'zambia', 'zambia', 'zambia', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'netherlands', 'france']",gb,False,False

She says she saw water gushing into her house from a nearby stream, and within 10 minutes the water level had reached her neck. On hearing that his mother's home was flooding, her son Kenneth rushed to the scene and swam his way through the rising waters to save his mother and young siblings. The 56-year-old farmer is one of thousands of victims of the floods in south-east Ghana. It is a disaster she is struggling to come to terms with. They were taken unawares and could not salvage anything, she tells me as beads of tears roll down her face. ""My entire farm is under the water and so is my house. I was only able to take my clothes. It took me about 14 years to build this house - there is nowhere to go, there is no other land to build on,"" Ms Kagbitor said. Her fate is shared by nearly 26,000 others, displaced by floods caused by the controlled spillage of excess water from the Akosombo and Kpong hydro-electric dams near the southern tip of Lake Volta. Ghana has been experiencing unpredictable rainfall patterns for months now, which many scientists say is the result of climate change. Heavy rains have significantly increased the volume of water in the two dams, and officials of the Volta River Authority, the electricity company that manages the dams, started the ""controlled spillage"" of the facilities a month ago. They say that the maximum safe operational level of the Akosombo dam is 277.5 ft (84.6m). If the water behind the dam reaches any higher, it could burst. The water level recently peaked just below this - around 277.26 ft, compelling them to ""spill"" excess water to prevent a catastrophe which could have dire consequences. The Akosombo and Kpong Dams generate about a third of Ghana's energy mix. The authorities say they will reduce the rate of spillage of the dams while monitoring the volume of water upstream. The Akosombo dam was built in the 1960s, a project championed by Ghana's first President Kwame Nkrumah to provide much-needed energy to industrialise the country. Its construction flooded parts of the Volta River Basin in the eastern region of southern Ghana and around 80,000 people had to be relocated. It also led to the creation of the Volta Lake, the largest man-made lake in the world by surface area. The dam has subsequently been spilled when needed, with limited impact on communities. However, this year's flooding is one of the worst to hit the more than 100 communities living downstream since the dam's creation. The National Disaster Management Organisation estimates that eight districts have been affected since the flooding started on Wednesday 11 October. Many homes have been completely submerged and authorities are only beginning to assess the impact of the floods. About a quarter of the Mepe community in an area we visited has been seriously impacted by the water. Toilet facilities, cemeteries and refuse dumps have all been flooded, raising serious concerns about the outbreak of disease. Essential services like water and electricity are no longer reaching the affected areas. Local official Ahorsu Amos Borlor said that residents ignored his repeated warnings to take precautionary measures when the spillage started. ""There are about 15 communities in the lower Volta basin. Eight of them have been greatly affected, farmlands have been washed away, so economic activities have been greatly affected. We are feeling bad, our livelihood has been taken away, this is not how we live,"" said Mr Borlor. Local resident Brian Foekpa is still reeling from the disaster. He says the flooding happened so quickly he could not take any of his belongings and could only save his family. ""The bike I use for my okada [motorcycle taxi] business is in the room that collapsed, so it has affected me. No food to eat. My farm has been washed away by the floods. As I'm talking to you, these clothes I have on me now are the only ones I have."" The Volta River Authority says it warned residents in the area ahead of the spillage. The power company also carried out simulation exercises with some communities about how to deal with a potential disaster, but that does not seem to have lessened the impact of the floods. Ghana's navy has been assisting with rescue efforts. It says it has rescued more than 8,000 people so far. The Deputy Director General of the National Disaster Management Organisation (Nadmo), Seji Saji, attributes the floods to heavy rains brought about by climate change. ""The heavy inflows from upstream of the Volta dams can only be explained by the volume of water that we are receiving from Burkina Faso to the northern region because those form the catchment areas of the Volta dams,"" he said. ""The quantum of water coming is very serious and we can only explain this with the issue of global warming and climate change."" He added that they have set up several holding areas for people displaced from their homes and are providing some relief aid. However, with more rains predicted, the water levels of the dams will keep rising - and so will the numbers of the displaced, and people like Ms Kagbitor will only be able to look on as their lives and livelihoods disappear under water.","['ghana', 'ghana', 'ghana', 'ghana', 'ghana', 'ghana', 'ghana', 'ghana', 'haiti']",gb,False,False

On Saturday, October 7, Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip embarked on a multipronged attack on Israel, dubbed Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, firing a barrage of thousands of rockets and infiltrating areas in the south of the country. The unprecedented operation had profound ramifications both for the Israelis and the Palestinians. In Israel, some 1300 people were killed and over 3,300 others were injured. In Gaza, Israel’s retaliatory attacks claimed over 1500 lives and wounded 6500 others. Israel alsocut off the electricity supplyand blocked the entry of food and fuel to the Gaza Strip as part of an unlawful “total siege” strategy adopted on Monday. With an Israeli ground invasion of the Gaza Strip imminent, the scale of the violence, disproportionately targeting Gaza’s 2.3 million inhabitants, is expected to magnify. As a Palestinian who has grown up within the confines of a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, I believe we are now at a turning point in our struggle. Operation Al Aqsa Flood, born out of the instinctual drive for survival of a people subjected to decades of unjust and inhumane humiliation and ill-treatment, has proved yet again that Israel cannot erase Palestine and put an end to the Palestinian people’s righteous struggle for liberation. It also demonstrated the increasing power and surprising resourcefulness of the Palestinian resistance. Although its specifics are yet to be fully unveiled, the operation showed that, despite facing nothing but oppression, ethnic cleansing, blockades and massacres for many years, the Palestinians are still able to stand up to Israel using the few resources available to them. The operation is a testament to the significant evolution Palestinian resistance has undergone over the past three decades, progressing from small and unorganised groups throwing basic Molotov cocktails in refugee camps to armed fighters paragliding into Israel and rockets infiltrating the “Iron Dome”. These recent incursions also had a profound impact on Israel’s self-image and standing in the international arena. Israel has long been presenting itself as the best and most efficient defender of American and wider Western interests in the Middle East, against threats from Iran and others. Recently, the Israeli regime has also been working to normalise its relations with Arab powers, promising to help them protect themselves from the aggressions of their regional rivals. However, the October 7 incursion, which demonstrated Israel’s inability to safeguard its own highly fortified borders, set within one of the most closely surveilled and controlled territories on Earth, put these assumptions and promises to a serious test. Indeed, after finding itself under an organised attack, instead of relying on its own much-advertised military capabilities and prowess, Israel immediately turned to its colonial backers for material and symbolic support. It was highly ironic that the United States had to promise further military assistance to a nation that is already heavily fortified and supported by an annual $3.8bn in aid. Despite the US President and European leaders all rushing to reaffirm their support for Israel after Saturday’s operation, it is hard to deny that the events of the past week, which saw Israel fail to protect itself against a group that has been under siege and under attack since its very inception, raised important questions about Israel’s value as an ally to the West. After all, a state unable to protect its own borders, despite being in possession of the best surveillance technologies and military equipment, could hardly help resolve its allies’ security concerns in a highly volatile region. Operation Al-Aqsa Flood raised serious questions about the future of normalisation efforts between Israel and its Arab neighbours as well. The Abraham Accords, the US-mediated agreements between Israel and several Arab states signed in 2020, were presented to the international community as a pathway to sustainable peace in the Middle East. Since the October 7 incursion, and Israel’s disproportionate retaliatory attacks on the Gazan population that followed, however, the Arab public made it clear to the international community that there can be no enduring peace in the region until Palestinians find justice and freedom. Thousands took to social media or to the streets across the Arab world in solidarity with Palestinians under total siege and relentless bombardment in Gaza and demanded from their leaders that they halt any efforts for normalisation with Israel until the oppression, occupation and abuse in Palestine comes to an end and millions of Palestinian refugees scattered around the region are allowed to return to their ancestral homelands. Now the leaders interested in normalisation with Israel have to consider both the revelations about Israel’s limited capabilities to protect its own borders and their constituents’ clear wish that they prioritise the wellbeing of Palestinians above anything that can be gained from a partnership with Israel. Furthermore, as Israel gears up to launch yet another devastating and deadly attack against a besieged population in the form of a ground invasion, there is a distinct possibility that armed groups in the region with strong ties to Hamas, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, may join in the conflict. This would lead to the conflict in Palestine expanding to a larger section of the region, making it even more difficult for any Arab nation to maintain normal relations with the government of Israel. After enduring 16 years of blockade, several bloody wars, and gradual strangulation, Palestinians in Gaza are now facing the threat of a genocidal land invasion. Israel’s ongoing acts of disproportionate violence and war crimes against Palestinians in Gaza are aimed not only at avenging the Hamas incursion but also at showing strength to the international community. The tragic events of the past week exposed Israel’s many weaknesses, revealing to its supporters that it is not the indispensable ally and security partner it purports to be. We have also seen how the Arab street is still firmly behind Palestinians and would not agree to normalisation between their states and Israel unless all Palestinians are safe, free and allowed to return to their homeland. Israel is trying to repair its image as a security leader with its attacks on Gaza’s besieged population, but all it is doing is to highlight the strength of Palestinian resistance.

On Tuesday, the diplomat published a compilation of excerpts from briefings over the past 18 months in which Moscow consistently raised concerns and provided evidence testifying to the unchecked spread of weapons supplied to Kiev. Zakharova suggested that the reason for this phenomenon was rampant corruption in Ukraine as well as corrupt ties between Washington and Kiev. Despite Moscow repeatedly calling for international media to highlight the issue, major Western news outlets have refused to conduct investigations or assess the data, the spokeswoman added. Below is a collection of briefings conducted by the Russian Foreign Ministry since March 24, 2022, in which it warned the international community on the issue. “…By supplying all these weapons to the neo-Nazis in Kiev, the West encourages human rights violations by the receiving state, escalates the armed confrontation and becomes an accomplice in the war crimes perpetrated by the Ukrainian Armed Forces against civilians on both sides of the line of contact. They are bound by specific commitments as OSCE member states and everything they do is at odds with these commitments. <...> However, with massive deliveries of military products to the Kiev regime, Western OSCE member states find it increasingly challenging to conceal the multiple facts exposing theft, the reselling of weapons and their transfers to arms traffickers. It remains an open question where the next shipment of weapons to Ukraine by the would-be compassionate Western alliance surfaces.But this is happening. Czech and Belgian rifles may well target innocent people, including their own citizens, anywhere around the world. However,NATO and EU countries have been persistently ignoring the threat of nationalists, radicals or terrorists in or outside Ukraine getting their hands on these state-of-the-art weapons. Considering that the risks in this regard are quite high, we can go as far as to conclude that Western countries encourage terrorist activity.” “…This is confirmed by the Pentagon’s recent report. The West should trust this document. The US media amplified its contents. The report states thatpart of Western arms sent to Ukraine was stolen. It notes that from February to September 2022, the Americans had no opportunity to follow up on supplied arms. They sent an audit commission to Ukraine only in October 2022. What happened before October 2022? The Americans had been supplying arms for over half a year without any control. Meanwhile, we understand what Kiev officials are all about. They don’t feel sorry for their own mothers in the same way as Zelensky doesn’t care about his grandfather. We can only guesshow many arms went to the black marketand whether the Pentagon commission can guarantee in any way its ability to prevent dealers and other poachers from laying their hands on them. These figures won’t be long in coming. Obviously, these arms will repeatedly surface in different parts of the world. Unfortunately, they are already in the hands of terrorists and other criminals.” “…At the same time, they are not analysing how the weapons that arenow being supplied en masse to the black marketwill be used. The issue is about illegal weapons, because many shipments don’t even make it to Kiev, much less the battlefields. Theyend up in the hands of dealers and then fall into the hands of terrorists and extremists. This will exacerbate the terrorist and extremist threat on the continent.” “…To believe numerous media reports, neo-Nazi groups are directly involved in the unrest in France. Has anyone in the Elysee Palace thought about this? If not, it is time to. Here’s more food for thought –the weapons supplied to Kiev are landing in the hands of protesters and are being used against the police in France.Has President Emmanuel Macron told the nation about this or is it a secret? Then we’ll say it ourselves. The weapons supplied by the West, NATO and France in particular, and the funds invested in the support of nationalists, Nazis and fascists in Ukraine is having blowback on their own territory and their people. We predicted this a year and a half ago.” “…At the same time, the European Union is not eager to keep providing for Ukraine. Sooner or later, European voters will ask (and they are already starting to raise questions) how their taxes have been spent, when they seecriminals killing their fellow citizens with weapons brought into their countries from Ukraine via the black market– because these supplies did not reach Bankovaya Street (and even if they reached it, they were immediately resold). According to the scheme in which the Kiev regime is involved, these weapons are not documented anywhere. And then EU residents will start asking questions. How long it takes before this happens also depends on them. They will want to know where their taxes went. Where is the output from the previous financial injections into the Kiev regime?” “…In addition, we have repeatedly issued warnings about the danger of flooding the Armed Forces of Ukraine with Western weapons and equipment, as well as theirunchecked spread and falling into the hands of sabotage and criminal groups. Making Belgian light firearms available to Ukrainian terrorists and saboteurs is far from the first such case. There are earlier examples of them being illegally used by the Taliban and Mexican drug cartels. Were the assault rifles randomly scattered in a poppy field as well? The West does not want and cannot control the flow of weapons coming into Ukraine. The Western assessments (not ours, not related to us and not affiliated with the Russian Federation) show that theillegal black market of weapons is gathering pace due to the weapons supplied to the Kiev regime. The amount of money is outlandish. The Kiev regime sold its mother, Ukraine, and its fathers and forefathers. It’s not only about weapons.They will be selling everything that falls into their hands.These are people without a moral core. They have no morality or ideals that would hold them back.” “…I believe that instead of planting fake news stories the US State Department should take up the specific and substantive weapons-related issue. I’m talking about unchecked supplies in that region through their entities under the pretext of providing assistance to the Kiev regime. In fact,these weapons have been popping up for a long time now not only in Europe, but other continents as well. Instead of engaging irresponsibly in this rhetoric, the US State Department should open up on whether it realises the fact that the weapons it supplies to Kiev as part of an assistance effort go immediately to the black market. Do they have any information on that? What can they say to this? Do they feel any responsibility?” “…The continuing supply of Western weapons to the Kiev regimehas led to large-scale military corruption and arms smuggling in Ukraine and beyond it. Over the past few months, the American and European officials and media have conducted several investigations that led them to conclude thatbetween 60 and 70 percent of Western weapons never reach Ukraine but are delivered directly to the black market. This is not reverse trading or covert deals but direct deliveries to a “non-addressee.” Interpol Secretary General Jurgen Stock warned last year that the wide availability of weapons during the Ukraine conflict would lead to the proliferation of illicit weapons in the post-conflict phase, with the weaponsending in the hands of organised crime and terrorists. There is only one thing he was wrong about: the proliferation of illicit weapons did not begin after the conflict but during it. The US Congress announced an audit of US spending and supplies to Ukraine in November 2022 and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak followed suit in December 2022. The reason is that the country has become a black hole. This may suit some people, but not everyone. Some people in Europe are apparently starting to consider what they will tell their voters when the guns sent to Ukraine “on paper” are used to kill Europeans. They will have to tell their voters how these supplies were controlled and how they were delivered to Ukraine. The truth will hit those who are generously signing the bills for the murder of Russians and Ukrainians out there, like a ton of bricks. We have said this on numerous occasions, without any sarcasm or glee, trying to warn them about the backlash. This is more than a simple boomerang effect, because some of these weaponsdisappear on the Western black marketsbefore reaching the border with Ukraine, and some of them are traded by the recipients on the battlefield. There are examples of such trade by those in Ukraine who were to receive these weapons directly on the battlefield, while the Ukrainian armed forces received completely different weapons. There are numerous reports to this effect in the public media. Last January, a group of US government auditors arrived in Ukraine to ensure accountability with regard to the US military and financial aid. Oh, how naïve these US auditors are to believe that someone will tell them anything and that somehow they will be able to get to the truth. A Transparency International report on the 2022 corruption problem in 180 countries graphically demonstrated the level of corruption among Ukrainian state officials. Let me remind you that Transparency International is one of those organisations that habitually salute the Kiev regime, post Ukraine support symbols on their websites, and have fully associated themselves with the West in this matter. They just cannot be suspected of being on our side. And yet, the report has assigned one of the lowest ratings to Ukraine (33 points out of the 100 possible), with the experts coming to the conclusion that the risk of wrongdoers misappropriating foreign financial aid was great both during the hostilities in Ukraine and later. They have no doubt as to what is happening to that financial aid. And the central point is that this is dangerous rather than just bad because of corruption. Embezzlement is not the only problem. There are also stolen weapons thatend up in the hands of criminal elements, organised crime groups, terrorists and extremists, rather than in a museum or a rubbish dump.” “…We have been discussing the issue of all types of weaponssupplied to Kiev disappearing and then surfacing somewhere elsefor more than a year now as it was happening. Before that, we covered this in various aspects as well, but it’s been a year now that we have been talking about what is going on in real life and will be happening in the short term. Everything we have been talking about for a long time (we revisit this issue literally every day) has come true. Interestingly, not everyone in the West (to put it mildly) wants to see this. It is clear why Washington does not want to see this, since this is part of their strategy to destabilise the situation in Europe. It’s obvious. However, EU officials, representatives, and political movements who are at the helm and have access to corresponding information are looking the other way, too, and it’s not clear why. I think that the usual answer will work here as well: some of them are proxies or conductors of Washington’s will and others, clearly due to political circumstances, prefer to remain silent, oblivious of where this silence will take them. Ironically, weapons of all kinds, including heavy weapons,made it to European black markets a long time ago. What are these black arms markets? You know well this is not about some kind of a field of dreams, a garden or a backyard where the situation can be controlled one way or another. Speaking of weapons, the black market is everywhere because of the internet which offers an opportunity to use blockchain to acquire technology through online information chains that are not controlled by governments or special services. It includes organised crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking, robbery, thuggery and, among other things, the transshipment of all this to other parts of the world. Some things remain in the EU, some go to other places. Clearly, they are under an illusion that this transit part will not affect them. They lived in this illusion when they were creating the Arab Spring with their own hands, destroying Libya, or trying to occupy Syria. Later, they had to come to their senses when tens, hundreds of thousands, and millions of migrants showed up at their doorstep with their problems and woke them up. Then, they were compelled to move from their illusory world to the real world. We never stopped talking about it.” “…The Ukrainian army and foreign mercenaries are using weapons supplied by the West to destroy the civilian populations of the DPR, LPR, and the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, including women and children. Ukrainian artillery carries out regular strikes on residential areas and civilian infrastructure, and the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant is being shelled with all the ensuing threats of a nuclear catastrophe. We have repeatedly sounded the alarm, reporting thatWestern weapons sent to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft and anti-tank systems, arespreading around the world due to endemic corruption in the country’s political and military circles. They eventually pop up in other regional conflicts, fall into the hands of crime rings, terrorists and extremists, including in Europe, the blossoming “garden” that Josep Borrell spoke about. The challenges this poses will not leave anyone safe, creating a threat to the internal security of every state on the European continent, and in particular their civilian air traffic. This is the simplest analytics available to everyone. It is not so difficult to read what happened after the United States and the anti-Iraqi coalition’s occupation and aggression against Baghdad – where the weapons ended up, what terrorist attacks occurred, what terrorist groups were formed, and what threats emerged to peace and security. The same holds true for Libya and the Arab Spring. The world has been through this. Apparently, the Western regimes failed to draw any conclusions from those mistakes (or to correct their mistakes).” “…Meanwhile, in reality, in terms of criminal law, they have long since become not only accomplices but the instigators of the crimes by the Kiev regime. It is revealing that the emptying of their own arsenals is compelling Ukraine’s Western curators to wonderwhere earlier supplied weapons have gone. Have they reached the frontline at all? Or have profits from their resale landed in the pockets of Kiev officials? Filth, horror, stench – this is what characterises the collaborationism of the Kiev regime with the NATO-centric world. Judging by the results of the Brussels get-togethers, one gets the impression that the NATO countries are pumping Ukraine full of arms also for the enrichment of the Western military-industrial complex, above all American defence industry, in a bid to keep it flush with contracts for a long time to come. This is classic colonial logic. Probably this is slave logic, not even colonial. Otherwise, it is impossible to explain their obsession with getting rid of their arsenals to the detriment of their national security, especially since the products ordered today will be made only two or three years later. These irresponsible actions are hitting rank-and-file Europeans who will have to pay for this entire bloody banquet.” ""...We have repeatedly spoken, in Foreign Ministry briefings and other statements, about the evidence of numerous instances of the misuse of the weapons supplied by NATO countries to Ukraine. Since the first weeks,we have warned that these weapons would spread across the European continent, and no one would ever be safe there from being attacked with one of these weapons sold on the black market. This is already an industry. It has gone beyond isolated facts or cases; it is a global reality. On June 1, 2022, Interpol Secretary General Jürgen Stock warned that after the end of the conflict in Ukraine, there is a high probability that illegal trade in weapons originally intended for Kiev would intensify. On July 1, 2022, an investigation conducted by the RT channel revealed black markets that operate via the darknet and are an important element in brokering illegal transactions. Missiles for the Javelin anti-tank system are offered at $30,000 (when they cost US taxpayers $178,000); missiles for the NLAW anti-tank systems are offered at $15,000, Switchblade 600 kamikaze drones at $7,000, small arms, grenades and body armor, at $1,100 -$3,600 (including delivery within Ukraine). The seller and the buyer do not even have to meet in person: after the buyer transfers the money, they receive the coordinates that mark the location of the purchased weapons. Everything the darknet markets are known for with respect to illegal goods, now includes the weapons the West is sending to Ukraine. On July 21, 2022, the Office of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council and the country’s Ministry of Defence announced the launch of the SOTA information and analytical system for monitoring arms supplies to Ukraine from partner countries to ensure transparency. That is, six months ago, the Kiev regime itself actually tried to gain control of the “circulation” of weapons that are supplied by the West. However, since the activation of the system, there has been no report on the results of its work. Because it’s useless. On July 22, 2022, Europol spokesman Jan Op Gen Oorth, in an interview with the German news agency DPA, mentioned the alarmingly high risk that weapons sent to Ukraine would end up in the hands of organised crime or terrorists. He said there were known cases where people have left Ukraine with weapons. According to Europol, criminal networks in the region plan to smuggle large quantities of arms and ammunition, including heavy weapons, using existing supply routes and online platforms. Can you imagine this? Not swords and knives, but heavy weapons. Not something criminals have managed to hide from the police in the past. Heavy weapons are now leaving the territory of Ukraine in unknown directions to surface elsewhere later. This is Interpol data. On August 4, 2022 the American CBS released a documentary “Arming Ukraine.” It was about arms smuggling and the greater frequency of such incidents in Ukraine. Volunteers and military experts appearing in the film maintained that from 60 to 70 percent of Western aid did not reach the Armed Forces of Ukraine at all (these were not arms that went to the Armed Forces of Ukraine and disappeared later). If we proceed from these figures, the 30-40 percent that reach them are also subject to the same trends. Can you imagine the arms shipments and numbers of weapons spreading uncontrollably? However, several days later the documentary was removed from the CBS website without any warning. The company explained that the information on this subject needed to be updated. Expert quotes criticising the Ukrainian military also disappeared from previews of the documentary on social media. And these were quotes from experts. Everything was cleaned up, including on social media. In an interview with the Finnish news agency Yle, Detective Superintendent of Finland’s Central Criminal Police, Christer Ahlgren, said that weapons initially sent to Ukraine, including assault rifles, pistols, grenades and combat drones, were discovered in a number of European countries. We understand well the situation because we repeatedly went through customs while boarding flights. There are announcements and warnings that it is forbidden to bring cold weapons, pistols, grenades, etc. Yes, such things happen. People try to take some of them onboard. But what about combat drones? This cannot happen due to neglect or accident. It is impossible to carry a combat drone in a suitcase either by plane, train or ship. There must be a completely different chain for the delivery and supply of these drones to the “non-destination” countries. At any rate, this was the case before. Now I wouldn’t be surprised at anything. In Ahlgren’s words, Finnish criminal groups are “very interested” in acquiring modern military systems, ammunition and weapons. He said Ukrainian weapons have already turned up in the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. All three states abstained from any comments. On November 1, 2022, quoting anonymous sources in the US Department of State, The Washington Post noted that a mere 10 percent out of 22,000 units of arms requiring special control, were subjected to inspection. On November 17, 2022, US Congress announced the start of auditing for all supplies and financial packages for Ukraine. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican in the House of Representatives and one of the authors of this initiative, explained that the American people deserve to know how their hard-earned tax dollars are spent when they are sent to a foreign state that is not a NATO member. I would say that this is no longer even a question of money. It is something quite different. Americans and other taxpayers and all people in the world deserve to know where NATO weapons are spreading and in what amounts. Speaking at the 16th Summit of Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) on November 30, 2022, President of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari noted that the authorities of the republic had already discovered weapons intended for Ukraine in the hands of extremists. This is Chad – no common border with Ukraine. Meanwhile, these weapons were meant for Ukraine. On December 15, 2022, a grenade launcher exploded in the office of Jaroslaw Szymczyk, Commander-in-Chief of the Police in Poland. According to the Zet radio station, the weapons were brought to Warsaw from Kiev by a special train without border controls. What is going on here? On December 16, 2022, Prime Minister of the UK Rishi Sunak decided to audit the aid granted to Ukraine. He said London wants to know what it has invested and what it has gained from it. I could advise him to look at our briefings and skip the audit. We will tell the Brits what they have invested and what they have gained.” October 27, 2022 briefing “As for the European Union and its member states, their actions and statements, if anything, are prolonging the armed confrontation. These countries are supplying weapons to the Kiev regime, reinforcing its sense of permissiveness and impunity, and harming the interests of their own citizens and jeopardising domestic security.These weapons are already getting back to them through the black market.” October 20, 2022 briefing “It can be said with certainty that alarge part of these weapons have already ended up or will soon end up on the black market, as monthly arms smuggling exceeds $1 billion. NATO military goods dispatched to the Kiev regime end up in the hands of terrorists, extremist and criminal groups in the Middle East, Central Africa and Southeast Asia. We have been pointing this out from the start. <...> It is an open secret that some of these weapons have been popping up on the black market, including in Europe.” July 21, 2022 briefing “…All this is taking place against the backdrop of reports by the Ukrainian and Western press on the subsequent smuggling of arms sent to Ukraine via darknet and other channels. These weapons are saturating the black markets that are actively used by extremist and terrorist groups all over the world. NATO and the EU are well aware of this situation. This is evident from their attempts to create some oversight mechanisms and compel Kiev to report on the targeted use of the supplied weapons. This is ridiculous. In the past few decades, they have failed to establish control over corruption in Ukraine. Washington and Brussels issued countless reports on this problem. Importantly, this is Western money. They pumped it into Ukraine and then told Kiev about their inability to defeat corruption. Do the Westerners believe that now they will be able to control the supply of arms and ammunition or expenses on personnel training for Ukraine’s armed forces? No. For many years, they have not controlled anything on Ukrainian territory. All they could do was to put their own people into the needed positions. Everyone saw how the political, economic, financial and lawmaking processes took place. Now the situation will repeat itself. The West will demand that Kiev fulfil its commitments butin reality arms and military hardware will be moving to the West via black markets. What will happen next? Watch a couple of action-thrillers and you will find out.” June 29, 2022 briefing “The United States and its allies continue flooding Ukraine with weapons. According to Western analysts, the amount of military, financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine they pledged since January 24 totals over $80 billion, of which 45 percent goes towards purely military support.Arms supplies pose a security threat not only in Ukraine, but beyond its borders as well. Soon enough, thousands of Stinger MANPADS, Javelin ATGMs, grenade launchers and other military equipment may and will find their way to global black markets. Law enforcement agencies in several Western and Eastern European countries have already noted a significant increase in criminal trafficking in weapons coming from the Kiev-controlled territories. Don't say you weren't warned. We warn you every day. Every weapon that is supplied to Ukraine will make it back primarily to Europe through the black market.” June 15, 2022 briefing “…As you understand, weapons shipments to Kiev tend to prolong the fighting, leading to new casualties among civilians andhelping the black market of weapons develop and expand, so that weapons will increasingly circulate across Europe and in other regions of the world.” June 8, 2022 briefing ""... According to media reports,transnational criminal groups have already worked out schemes for shipping these weapons out of Ukraine, including heavy artillery. Some of these weapons have already found their way into Bosnia, Albania and Kosovo.<...> Those supplying these weapons to Kiev today are putting the safety of their own people at risk because these weapons end up in the hands of criminals and terrorists. In doing so, they seem to forget thatarms supplies to Ukraine create a black market for these weapons, including in Western Europe.The governments in the donor countries have so far refrained from breaking their silence on this subject, while independent experts and specialised agencies like Interpol have already started sounding the alarm. They understand what this will lead to. According to media reports, transnational criminal groups have already worked out schemes for shipping these weapons out of Ukraine, including heavy artillery.Some of these weapons have already found their way into Bosnia, Albania and Kosovo.Let me remind you that the West, the United States and NATO in general have been showing how they really care about the future of the Balkans. We can imagine the kind of future the Balkans will have under NATO’s patronage with all these ‘arms upgrades’ from the black market. Those supplying these weapons to Kiev today are putting the safety of their own people at risk because these weapons end up in the hands of criminals and terrorists. This is not even a matter of legal accountability, but the fact that this will go down in history as the responsibility of the NATO-centric countries. There is no getting away from this. This evidence will surface during investigations of hit jobs, robberies and raiding attacks.” May 25, 2022 briefing ""... That said, the Westerners admit their inability to identify the end users of weapons and guarantee their exclusive use by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.There is a growing risk that these weapons may land in the black market and be acquired by criminal groups throughout the world.” April 28, 2022 briefing ""... However,neither the United States nor its NATO partners are in a position to track the final destination of their weaponsupplies and guarantee their use by the armed forces of Ukraine and no one else.” “…Let our Western ‘partners’ not be surprised whenthe weapons they had made available to Kiev will later surface in the most unlikely places, as it has always been the case before. By their actions, they created a terrorist threat for Europe and the entire world.”","['ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'russia', 'russia', 'russia', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'uk', 'uk', 'libya', 'libya', 'syria', 'iraq', 'belgium', 'belgium', 'finland', 'netherlands', 'denmark', 'sweden', 'chad', 'poland', 'poland', 'unitedkingdom', 'paraguay', 'bosniaandherzegovina', 'bosniaandherzegovina', 'albania', 'albania', 'kosovo', 'kosovo']",ru,True,False

At the same time, artifacts from the Tauric Chersonesos preserve are currently on display in the Russian city of Novgorod in an exhibition called Byzantine Gold. ""The exhibition includes more than 200 objectsâ€¦that clearly testify to the former grandeur of the churches of Chersonesos and Novgorod,"" reads the museum's summary of the show. Such exhibitions are just recent instances of the transfer of priceless artifacts by Russian occupying forces around different parts of Ukraine currently under their control or to Russia itself, a process Ukrainian experts say is a nearly unprecedented case of cultural expropriation that amounts to a war crime. ""Russia's actions fall under the definitions of 'illegal transfer' and 'illegal appropriation,'"" said Denys Yashniy, a researcher at the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, or Monastery of the Caves. ""All of the illegal manipulations of the occupiers with Ukraine's cultural heritage, particularly with Tauric Chersonesos and Kamyana Mohyla, violate not only Ukrainian law but also international law,"" Borys Babin, a professor of international law and former Ukrainian presidential representative for Crimea, told RFE/RL's Crimea.Realities in February. ""Particularly, the Geneva Convention on the inviolability of cultural heritage and the norms of the 1954 Hague Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict."" Russian efforts to ""transform the historical significance of captured Ukrainian monuments"" are part of an ""obvious intention of genocide toward the Ukrainian people and a gross violation of the 1948 UN Convention on Genocide,"" Babin said. The Inter-Museum Working Group Russia has been ""intentionally and purposefully"" expropriating Ukraine's cultural heritage since the occupation of Crimea in 2014, said Ukrainian cultural and political commentator Yevhen Savisko. ""Russia not only wants to cause Ukraine material harm but also to destroy layers of culture in the Crimea region,"" he added. ""This is necessary for the rewriting of the history of the ethnic groups who have lived and who are living in Crimea. ""And all this is being done at the orders of the highest leadership of the Russian Federation,"" he continued. ""The organization and coordination of the illegal seizure of museum objects from Crimea has been undertaken at least at the level of the Russian Culture Ministry and the central apparatus of the [Federal Security Service (FSB)]."" Crimea and the parts of southern Ukraine around the Azov Sea and the Dnieper River have been occupied since prehistoric times by a mosaic of Greek, Turkish, Scythian, Germanic, Roman, and Slavic peoples. ""This is simply an incredible, interesting territory that played an important role in the history of the population that lived on the territory of Ukraine,"" said Serhiy Nemtsev, the former head of the archaeological museum at Kherson State University. ""The Zaporizhzhya Cossacks are just the last point in a long chain of cultures and societies that existed on these shores."" The Russian effort to manipulate the cultural heritage of the occupied parts of Ukraine has been overseen by the Russian Historical Society (RHS), which has been headed since 2012 by Sergei Naryshkin, a close associate of President Vladimir Putin with a KGB background who has also headed Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) since 2016. 'Nothing In Common' Shortly after Russia's massive invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the RHS set up an ""inter-museum working group"" that focused on the occupied parts of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions and aimed ""to show the historically inseparable connection of the region with Russia"" through ""unique materials from the fund collections of museums and archives,"" according to the working group's application for funding from the Russian Presidential Fund of Cultural Initiatives in September 2022. During a meeting with Putin in Moscow in November 2022, Artyom Rubchenko, the RHS representative in the occupied Ukrainian city of Luhansk, summarized the working group's activity. ""It is made up of leading professionals -- museum workers from the leading museums of the Russian Federation and university instructors,"" Rubchenko said. ""This group has been working since April and about 20 people have participated in it. During trips to the territories where the main events of this year have happened, more than 4,000 items have been collected. Many of them are already being studied, and on the basis of these collections we have already opened four exhibitions in major Russian museums."" In comments to Interfax in July 2022, Naryshkin proposed the study of ancient fortifications in eastern and southern Ukraine ""which were built by Russians and Little Russians for the defense of their common fatherland, our Russia."" ""Little Russians"" is an anachronistic and offensive term for Ukrainians. All objects uncovered during the research, Naryshkin said, must be ""included in the unified state register of the cultural heritage of the peoples of the Russian Federation."" In November 2022, the RHS established the administrative oversight of the Tauric Chersonesos museum complex in Sevastopol, which documents the ancient Greek settlement of Crimea, over the paleolithic Kamyana Mohyla in the Zaporizhzhya region. ""No historian, archaeologist, or culturologist would be able to provide a conscious explanation for such a combination,"" wrote Ukrainian archaeologist Evelina Kravchenko in an article in January. ""All the sites at these respective reservesâ€¦belong to completely different social groups and have nothing in common either in history, archaeology, or architecture."" Instead, Kravchenko contended, the move is dictated by Russia's desire to attribute to Kamyana Mohyla the ""fake meaning"" of ""the alleged cradle of Russian Orthodoxy."" 'Colossal' Losses ""We can say that a shipment of weapons has arrived in Ukraine,"" said an announcement by Ukraine's Culture Ministry on October 20. The ministry was announcing the return to Ukraine of 14 ""ancient weapons from the Eneolithic to the Middle Ages"" by the United States. It was not immediately clear whether the objects were stolen from museum collections or whether they were discovered by looters using metal detectors in the Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine -- a practice that has been thriving since the catastrophic breach of the Kakhovka dam in June and the subsequent draining of its reservoirs. The United States alone has confiscated more than 20 groups of items looted in Ukraine and illegally smuggled out of the country. ""The area flooded by the hydropower plant was the umbilical cord of the Cossacks,"" said Ukrainian historian Oleksandr Alfyorov, discussing the importance of sites in the Zaporizhzhya region in early Ukrainian history. ""The flooded territories were not only the heart of Zaporizhzhya but also important for Kyivan Rus as it expanded its historical range."" Now, Ukrainian historians say, many previously unexplored or underexplored sites are vulnerable to uncontrolled looting. Many items, they fear, could even end up being melted down as scrap metal by people unaware of their significance. Kateryna Shtepa, an analyst with the Kyiv Institute of State Relations, said it is easiest for Ukraine to recover historical objects when they are smuggled abroad. In June, the Dutch Supreme Court upheld a government decision to return to Ukraine a trove of Scythian gold artifacts that were on display in Amsterdam from a Crimean museum when Russia occupied the peninsula. Moscow had been seeking to have the treasures sent to Crimea. ""The items were returned to Ukraine, where there is a legitimate government,"" Shtepa said. ""On the basis of this case, it may be possible to return other stolen objects if they are on the territory of third countries."" Analyst Savisko noted that Moscow routinely ignores the decisions of international courts, which means that recovering items taken to Russia will be virtually impossible. ""And searching for stolen items on the territory of such a huge country is not possible,"" he said. ""Unless some nice items show up in prominent Russian museums."" Items that have been newly discovered since the Russian occupation and so have not been catalogued by Ukrainian scholars will likely never be recovered or studied properly, Savisko added. ""The losses can only be described as colossal,"" said historian Yashniy. ""But how much exactly, no one can say."" On November 4, 2022, Putin addressed Russian historians and Orthodox clergymen at Moscow's Manezh exhibition on National Unity Day holiday. Without providing evidence, Putin repeated his claim that the West had been trying to turn Ukraine against Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. ""If someone wants to deprive a state of sovereignty and turn its citizens into vassals,"" he said, ""they begin precisely by revising the history of the country in order to deprive people of their roots and doom them to unconsciousness"" -- something critics say Putin himself is trying to do to Ukraine.

The army, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, has been battling the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces commanded by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, after the two fell out in a power struggle. ""We need to reach 18 million people and we will not give up on that target,"" Clementine Nkweta-Salami, the UN's resident and humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, told reporters. ""But we need more international support, better access to the people who need us and safety for our operations."" She highlighted that 19 members of humanitarian organisations have been killed and 29 others injured since the conflict erupted. While she did not comment on whether they had been specifically targeted, she noted that ""in many instances, our efforts are being hampered"", despite indicating ""where it is we will be, and what we will be doing"". The fighting in Sudan broke out on April 15. ""The past six months has caused untold suffering in Sudan,"" Nkweta-Salami said. Nearly 7,500 people have been killed in Sudan since the conflict began, according to a conservative estimate from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data project. Fighting has displaced almost 4.3 million people within Sudan, while around 1.2 million more have fled across its borders, UN figures show. Among them, ""we've seen a significant brain drain. A lot of the professionals have left Sudan"", said Nkweta-Salami. Humanitarian aid has become a target for attacks and looting by armed gangs and criminals. ""We have been able to deliver assistance through a cross-border mechanism from Chad and into Darfur,"" Nkweta-Salami said. ""In mid-September, nearly 3,000 metric tonnes of aid supplies were delivered by 66 trucks across six states. But we need to be able to deliver much more -- safely, repeatedly, and fast."" The UN has relocated its headquarters to Port Sudan on the Red Sea as the fighting in the capital Khartoum made the international organisation's work impossible. The obligatory presence of soldiers while loading trucks in Port Sudan and delays in obtaining visas are all additional obstacles in getting aid around the country. One of the poorest countries in the world, Sudan has seen its health system brought to its knees by the conflict, with 70 percent of hospitals no longer functioning, said Nkweta-Salami. The UN official said she was worried that heavy rains and floods could lead to more outbreaks of water-borne diseases. ""Battling a cholera outbreak in a war zone is difficult at the best of times. With fighting escalating, it may be near-impossible to control,"" she said. Despite the complex humanitarian crisis, the UN is battling a funding shortage. ""The $2.6-billion humanitarian appeal is just one-third funded,"" said Nkweta-Salami. ""The population of Sudan is balancing on a knife edge as their country is gradually consumed by this conflict,"" she said. ""There's also a risk that... if this situation is not brought to an end, that it will have a spillover effect in the region and that is something we must and should avoid.""","['sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'chad', 'unitedstates']",us,True,False

""Nobody had imagined that six months on, we would still be witnessing such large daily inflows,"" said Marie-Helene Verney, Acting Humanitarian Coordinator to South Sudan. Since the start of the conflict, South Sudan has received more than 310,000 new arrivals from Sudan as of 13 October, including South Sudanese returnees (over 90 per cent), refugees and third-country nationals. The influx is expected to continue. Many new arrivals are extremely vulnerable and in need of immediate assistance. ""As the weeks go by, people arrive with less and less resources and in increasingly worse states of health, with malnutrition also on the rise among new arrivals as conditions in Sudan deteriorate further,"" emphasized Marie-Helene Verney. Poor infrastructure and in particular lack of roads, flooding and funding constraints are severely testing the capacity of humanitarian actors to respond both at the border and in receiving communities, as well as putting pressure on onward transportation, which remains the most critical need in this response. IOM and other humanitarian partners have assisted approximately 150,000 people to move on to final destinations so far. The Government of South Sudan has also provided transport to thousands, while many others have made their own way to their communities. South Sudan continues to face overlapping crises, including floods, conflict and food insecurity - all of which adversely affect the resilience and vulnerability of people across the country. The ongoing Sudan crisis has had a dramatic negative impact on the already fragile humanitarian situation. Disruptions in cross-border trade and humanitarian corridors have led to increased prices of food and commodities, particularly in the northern half of the country where most of the new arrivals are settling. This has worsened food insecurity and compounded acute humanitarian needs for the existing population, as well as the new arrivals. Additional humanitarian access constraints, such as increased threats against humanitarian personnel and looting of assets, continue to challenge the already difficult humanitarian response. ""This crisis has stretched the humanitarian response in South Sudan close to breaking point. With no end in sight, a global decrease in humanitarian funding and more new conflicts breaking out around the world, humanitarian partners are increasingly forced to deprioritize even life-saving activities. In such a context, the Government of South Sudan is called upon to step up the delivery of basic services in vulnerable communities, with the support of development actors,"" underscored the Acting Humanitarian Coordinator. Even as the global context worsens, additional funding is needed by the end of the year to provide life-saving nutrition services to thousands of children arriving from Sudan with moderate and severe acute malnutrition, as well as access to adequate water, sanitation and hygiene services and facilities. Additional funding is also needed to provide adequate space in overcrowded transit centres to reduce the risks of disease outbreaks and gender-based violence. Additional funding will also support children fleeing the war in Sudan to resume learning and help reduce protection risks, such as child marriage, child labor and recruitment of child soldiers. Notes to editors: The revised Emergency Response Plan for South Sudan led by UNHCR and IOM requires US$356 million. So far, 25 per cent of funding to partners in South Sudan was reported in the Refugee Funding Tracker. An estimated 9.4 million people, 76 per cent of South Sudan's population, are projected to need humanitarian and/or protection assistance in 2023. The South Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) requires $1.7 billion to reach 6.8 million of the most vulnerable people with urgent vital support.

More than 5 million people have been forced to flee, schools are still closed and children in particular are exposed to great danger,' Minister of International Development Anne Beathe Tvinnereim said. 'As always, the brutalities of war hit children the hardest. We now see a generation of Sudanese children caught in an unparalleled crisis. Not only do they have to live with the immediate consequences of conflict, displacement and insecurity, but they lack access to basic services such as healthcare and schooling,' Ms Tvinnereim said. 15 October marks six months since the war started in Sudan. Half of Sudan's population, almost 25 million people, now require humanitarian assistance and protection, according to the United Nations. 'Hospitals in the country have been affected by the fighting and put out of operation. The shortage of medicines and medical equipment is acute. The rainy season makes the situation even worse, with heavy rainfall and flooding. Diseases such as cholera, dengue fever and malaria are now spreading fast,' said Ms Tvinnereim. Hard to reach those most in need Most schools in the country have been closed since 15 April. There are reports that children in Sudan are being subjected to killings, forcible recruitment, violence and abuse. The continuing battles and major obstacles to crossing the border and travelling in the country make the work difficult. 'The humanitarian organisations reach only a third of Sudan's population. That makes it very hard to get help to those who need it most. Norway has repeatedly urged Sudanese authorities to respect humanitarian principles, remove bureaucratic barriers to humanitarian organisations and grant the necessary visas and permits,' Ms Tvinnereim said. It is crucial to support and cooperate with local actors. 'Local actors do an indispensable job in Sudan, often putting their lives at risk. For this they deserve recognition. They reach even the most challenging areas, where international organisations cannot. They too need our help,' said Ms Tvinnereim. Serious abuses and human rights violations The human rights situation in Sudan is critical, and there have been credible claims that both parties in the conflict have committed serious offences and human rights violations. 'This war's impact on the Sudanese civilian population has been extraordinary. Our stance remains that the fighting must stop immediately. All parties must fulfil their duties under international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law. Civilians must be protected,' said Minister of Foreign Affairs Anniken Huitfeldt. Norway, the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany have submitted a resolution at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva to set up a fact-finding mission and an investigation mechanism for human rights violations committed in Sudan since 15 April. 'We must ensure that the serious accusations of offenses are investigated in a credible and impartial manner. Holding to account those who are responsible and ending impunity are key steps forward. We are extremely pleased that the Human Rights Council has now voted to create the investigation mechanism. This is an important step for the Sudanese people,' said Ms Huitfeldt. Alongside the international effort to institute a lasting cease-fire and humanitarian access, Norway is working to bolster civilian efforts to bring about a political process. 'The war must end. We actively support trying to establish an inclusive political process based on democratic principles and the wishes of the population. In this process it will be especially important that women and youth are heard and that all of Sudan is represented,' said Ms Huitfeldt.","['sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'norway', 'norway', 'norway', 'unitedstates', 'unitedkingdom', 'germany', 'switzerland']",us,True,False

Sudan has become the world's fastest-growing displacement crisis.I have talked to many of the displaced who've told me how their lives have been completely upended.I have met displaced mothers in Sudan who do not know where to find the next meal for their children.I have met families sleeping in makeshift shelters, struggling to find food and water, unable to access health care, their children out of school and the family breadwinners out of work.Half of Sudan's population - 24.7 million people - now require humanitarian aid and protection as the conflict, displacement, and disease outbreaks threaten to consume the entire country.The conflict has already crippled Sudan's health sector with 70 per cent of all hospitals no longer functional.The conflict could reach areas like Jazirah State, Sudan's breadbasket. This would have grave consequences for food security.And as the fighting spreads, we are receiving reports of increasing cases of sexual and gender-based violence, enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, and grave violations of human and children's rights.In recent weeks, another shock has hit Sudan as heavy rains and floods have affected more than 70,000 people across seven states [Northern, River Nile, North Darfur, Gedaref, White Nile, North Kordofan, and South Kordofan].I am concerned that this could lead to more outbreaks of water-borne diseases. There is already a cholera outbreak declared in the eastern state of Gedaref, and we are investigating if it has spread to Khartoum and South Kordofan.Battling a cholera outbreak in a warzone is difficult at the best of times. With fighting escalating, it may be near-impossible to control.Four months ago [11 May] the parties meeting in Jeddah committed to de-escalate the fighting, minimize civilian harm and refrain from any disproportionate attacks. But since then, the killing of civilians has continued in Khartoum, Nyala, Al Fasher, and other areas.Just two weeks ago scores were injured in an attack on a crowded market in southern Khartoum.I call, once again, on the parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law and take immediate steps to safeguard civilians.The humanitarian response is a lifeline for millions of people.UN aid organizations have reached at least 3.6 million people working with and through Sudanese humanitarian workers, civil society organizations, non-governmental organizations, including the Emergency Response Rooms. I applaud our Sudanese partners without whom little could have been achieved.We have been able to deliver assistance through a cross-border mechanism from Chad and into Darfur. In mid-September, nearly 3,000 metric tons of aid supplies were delivered by 66 trucks across six states. But we need to be able to deliver much more - safely, repeatedly, and fast.We need to reach 18 million people. We will not give up on that target. But we need more international support, better access to the people who need us, and safety for our operations.Nineteen aid workers have been killed and 29 injured. It is unacceptable - and it is unlawful.We also need to see an end to interference from the conflict parties in our operations, including forced checks of humanitarian trucks and mandatory military presence during the loading process in Port Sudan and Jazirah.I hope that we will see swift action to reduce bureaucratic obstacles - including delays in visa approvals for staff - as promised by Sudanese authorities in a donor meeting yesterday.Lastly, a word on funding: the $2.6 billion humanitarian appeal is just one third funded. I thank those donors who have stepped up and urge all donors to increase funding to bridge the funding gap for organizations providing critical assistance. This includes support for the Sudan Humanitarian Fund, which provides funding to our national partners.The population of Sudan is balancing on a knife's edge as their country is gradually consumed by this conflict.We need the parties to live up to their commitments and to live up to their obligations.And we need the world to show much more solidarity - or we may witness Sudan falling off the cliff.Thank you.","['sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'saudiarabia', 'chad', 'unitedstates']",us,True,False

""This would have great consequences for food security,"" she said, noting that the violence ""has already crippled Sudan's health sector, with 70 per cent of all hospitals no longer functional"". Humanitarians are equally concerned about reports of increasing cases of sexual and gender-based violence, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and grave violations of human and children's rights. Cholera 'near impossible to control' In addition to the destruction of war which is believed likely to have claimed thousands of lives including 19 aid workers to date, Sudan's people have also faced further shocks in recent weeks as heavy rains and floods have affected more than 70,000 people across seven states, prompting concerns of a spike in waterborne diseases. A cholera outbreak has been declared in the eastern state of Gedaref and humanitarians are already investigating whether it has spread to Khartoum and South Kordofan. ""With fighting escalating, it may be near impossible to control,"" Ms. Nkweta-Salami said, as she called on the warring parties to recommit to previous pledges to ""de-escalate fighting, minimize civilian harm and refrain from any disproportionate attacks"". Humanitarians 'pushing the limits' Delivering aid in a warzone is extremely complicated, dangerous and time-consuming, often involving negotiations with various armed groups for access to remote communities, the UN official explained. Despite these challenges, she insisted that relief teams were stepping up efforts to reach Sudan's most vulnerable communities. ""We have a very committed humanitarian team on the ground, we are trying to push the limits of our ability to reach some of these hard-to-reach areas. And I think if we get a strong not only commitment, but a commitment that is translated today into positive action by all the parties to this conflict, then hopefully we will have no longer deaths amongst humanitarian workers.""","['sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'switzerland', 'unitedstates']",us,True,False

It can also give disaster response teams critical information on where a landslide may have occurred so they can investigate and deploy life-saving resources.This screenshot from PDC's DisasterAWARE Pro software shows LHASA landslide hazard probabilities for Myanmar in Sept. 2023. Red areas indicate the highest risk for landslide occurrence within the past three hours, while orange and yellow indicate lesser risk. Credit: Pacific Disaster CenterPartnering to protect the vulnerableGenerating landslide nowcasts is merely the first step. To be truly effective, vulnerable communities must receive the data in a way that is accessible and easy to integrate into existing disaster management plans. That's where the Pacific Disaster Center comes in.PDC is an applied research center managed by the University of Hawaii, and it shares NASA's goal to reduce global disaster risk through innovative uses of science and technology. Its flagship DisasterAWARE software provides early warnings and risk assessment tools for 18 types of natural hazards and supports decision-making by a wide range of disaster management agencies, local governments, and humanitarian organizations. Prominent users include the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), and the World Food Program (WFP).""The close pairing of our organizations and use of PDC's DisasterAWARE platform for early warning has been a special recipe for success in getting life-saving information into the hands of decision-makers and communities around the world,"" said Chris Chiesa, PDC deputy executive director.The collaboration with PDC brings NASA's landslide tool to tens of thousands of existing DisasterAWARE users, dramatically increasing LHASA's reach and effectiveness. Chiesa notes that teams in El Salvador, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic have already begun using these new capabilities to assess landslide hazards during the 2023 rainy season.PDC's software ingests and interprets LHASA model data and generates maps of landslide risk severity. It then uses the data to generatelandslidehazard alerts for a chosen region that the DisasterAWARE mobile app pushes to users. These alerts give communities critical information on potential hazards, enabling them to take protective measures.DisasterAWARE landside risk report for Myanmar, showing estimated population, infrastructure and capital exposure to landslide risk, as well as the community's needs. Credit: Pacific Disaster CenterDisasterAWARE also creates comprehensive regional risk reports that estimate the number of people and infrastructure exposed to a disaster—focusing specifically on things like bridges, roads, and hospitals that could complicate relief efforts when damaged. This information is critical for allowing decision-makers to effectively deploy resources to the areas that need them most.This effort between NASA and the PDC builds upon a history of fruitful cooperation between the organizations. In 2022, they deployed aNASA global flood modeling toolto enhance DisasterAWARE's flood early-warning capabilities. They have also shared data and expertise during multiple disasters, includingHurricane Iota in 2020, the2021 earthquake in Haiti, and the devastating August 2023wildfires in Maui, PDC's base of operations.""The LHASA model is allopen-sourceand leverages publicly available data from NASA and partners,"" says Dalia Kirschbaum, lead of the NASA landslides team and director of Earth Sciences at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. ""This enables other researchers and disaster response communities to adapt the framework to regional or local applications and further awareness at scales relevant to their decision-making needs."" Kirschbaum and her team were recently awarded the prestigious NASA Software of the Year award for their work developing LHASA.Provided byNASACitation: NASA, Pacific Disaster Center increase landslide hazard awareness (2023, October 27) retrieved 3 November 2023 ","['myanmar', 'myanmar', 'elsalvador', 'honduras', 'unitedstates', 'haiti', 'germany']",gb,False,False

Campa, Rong-gong Lin Ii, Los Angeles Times Text messages began to circulate about five minutes after an earthquake warning sounded for celebrants at St. James' Episcopal Church in South … [+5953 chars]",San Marino,"Text messages began to circulate about five minutes after an earthquake warning sounded for celebrants at St. James' Episcopal Church in South Pasadena on Sunday morning.About 80 congregants, clergy and choir members lay in the pews and covered their heads as a simulatedearthquakehit the sanctuary. After about 20 seconds, parishioners rose and exited the church, heading to a designated meeting spot in the adjacent open parking lot.Most church members texted designated cohort leaders, letting them know they were safe and outside the building.Some parishioners did not respond, though. And others who gathered in the parking lot stood directly in the path of a telephone pole and overheard power lines, which could have caused severe bodily harm had Sunday's drill been a powerful earthquake.Seismologist Lucy Jones, California's earthquake expert and the chief architect of Sunday's drill, took note of the final tally. Six of seven cohorts responded that their parishioners were safe and no one was hurt or lost.""Actually, this worked out better than I thought it would,"" Jones, a parishioner at St. James, said through a laugh. ""I thought we were going to be having a comedy of errors, to be honest, and this was a nice surprise.""St. James was one of six Episcopal parishes, out of the 135 that make up the Los Angeles Diocese, to take part in Sunday's disaster resiliency event. Drills also took place at All Saints of Riverside, St. Andrew's in Irvine, St. Edmund's in San Marino, St. Luke's in Monrovia and St. Peter's in San Pedro.Churches, temples, mosques and other faith-based institutions could serve as key places to help communities prepare for natural disasters, Jones contends.In 2016, after more than 30 years with the U.S. Geological Survey, Jones launched the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society, and she's created a Connected Communities Resilience Program intended to help community- and faith-based organizations as well as local governments and nonprofits create a community-resiliency action plan to prepare for earthquakes or other disasters.In a program established for the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles, churches are called on to understand the risk their parishioners face—whether from earthquakes, extreme heat, flooding or wildfires— and then create a disaster-resilience program.""When we talk about earthquake preparedness, that gets everyone's attention,"" Jones said. ""But it's also about preparing and becoming resilient for other disasters that also happen.""Potential steps in these preparedness plans could include reducing earthquake vulnerability in the church as well as members' homes, stocking emergency supplies of water and food or creating a cooling center for intense heat waves. Churches may also decide to organize parishioners into groups who are assigned to text mobility-impaired parishioners to see whether they need help.Other action items could include having the church's building evaluated for structural safety and securing bookshelves and electronics to walls.Jones classified the fight to stop climate change as a ""moral imperative"" but also said it was necessary to understand that ""facing more disasters"" is unavoidable.The best way for communities to survive is to ""shorten what is needed for recovery"" after a disaster, she said.The two methods to accomplish that are mitigation—checking retrofitting and evaluating flood risks, for example—and building community bonds. With the latter, Jones said that communities that share resources and stay in communication have a better chance of recovering.The Rev. Melissa McCarthy, canon to the ordinary of the Diocese of Los Angeles, emphasized that proximity is not always an advantage in community building.The diocese's first cohort includes three San Gabriel Valley parishes within minutes of one another, along with churches in Irvine, Riverside and San Pedro.She said an earthquake centered in the San Gabriel Valley would probably leave the three neighboring parishes in need, while the damage would be less severe in other areas.""In that instance,"" she said, ""a parish like the one in Irvine could come through with aid and vice versa if there was a fire in Irvine, which has happened before.""The potential for earthquake damage is a non-theoretical pursuit at St. James. In 1987, the Whittier Narrows' magnitude 5.9 thrust fault earthquake rocked the church on Oct. 1 while a 5.3 aftershock struck three days later.St. James' 75-foot bell tower was scarred with fissures, popping bricks and pieces of cornice. While the church and bell tower underwent repairs, the structures were also earthquake-retrofitted.""Some of the tower had collapsed, and plaster covered everything inside thechurch,"" said 92-year-old Jan Arenz, who was a congregant at St. James' in 1987. ""For two years, we met in the parish hall, so earthquake safety is wonderful and necessary.""Arenz admitted she didn't ""entirely lie down"" on the pew, leaving her feet still on the ground because the position wasn't entirely comfortable.When Jones announced an earthquake was happening, 81-year-old Pasadena resident Judy Barbatoe immediately covered her head.The retiree, who uses a wheelchair, hoped to avoid hypothetical falling ceiling plaster.At that moment, Barbatoe became aware of all the dangers and shortcomings of her surroundings: nearby hanging chandeliers and stained-glass windows along with exits that are not wheelchair-accessible.""Sometimes you need events like these,"" she said, ""to realize all the dangers around you and how best to get ready.""2023 Los Angeles Times.

New York 9 October 2023 The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General. [The briefing followed apress statementby the Secretary-General.] First, we will just start with the region. Lebanon Our peacekeeping colleagues in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) report they have detected explosions near Al-Boustan in southwest Lebanon this afternoon. While they are working to gather more information, the Head of the Mission and Force Commander, Aroldo Lázaro Sáenz, is in contact with the parties, urging them to exercise maximum restraint and utilize the Mission's liaison and coordination mechanisms to prevent further risks of escalation and loss of life. In addition to leadership being in constant contact with the authorities both in Lebanon and in Israel since the events began, UN peacekeepers in Lebanon have remained present along the Blue Line to maintain stability. They have also adapted and enhanced their presence throughout the area of operations, including counter rocket-launching capabilities. **Gaza Turning to Gaza: Our humanitarian colleagues report that over 120,000 people have been internally displaced in Gaza, due to concerns over their protection and the destruction of homes. You heard the Secretary-General on what we are seeing already in Gaza. Six health-care workers have also been killed and four others were injured, with seven health-care facilities and nine ambulances damaged. In Gaza, damage to water, sanitation and hygiene facilitates has undermined services to more than 400,000 people. The Gaza Power Plant is now the only source of electricity and could run out of fuel within days. Also, as of today, the World Food Programme (WFP) has begun distributing food for up to 100,000 internally displaced Gazans who are seeking refuge in UNRWA shelters with fresh bread and canned food. In the next few days, WFP plans on starting to roll out assistance to up to 800,000 people with food and cash assistance as the situation develops, provided the necessary funding is made available. WFP needs $16.8 million to reach 805,000 people in the next month. UNRWA For its part, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) says they are sheltering about 137,000 people in 83 of its schools in all areas of the Gaza Strip. An UNRWA school sheltering displaced families in the Gaza Strip was directly hit over the weekend. The school was severely damaged and was housing about 225 people, though no casualties were recorded among the displaced, but the school sustained significant structural damage. All UNRWA schools across the Gaza Strip are closed. More than 300,000 students are impacted. **Afghanistan Moving on to Afghanistan, we, along with our humanitarian partners, are now ramping up the response following the 6.3-magnitude earthquake, which struck Herat province, in the west of the country, on Saturday. Our humanitarian colleagues note that the epicentre of the earthquake was in Zindajan district where reports indicate that 100 per cent of homes have been destroyed. According to community-level assessments, nearly 1,300 people have died and 1,700 were injured in Zindajan. In total, an estimated more than 12,000 men, women, and children have been impacted across five districts of Herat Province. Several hundred households have also been displaced to Herat City. The figures are likely to rise in the coming days as search-and-rescue efforts and assessments continue. We have deployed assessment teams and we are providing emergency shelter supplies, blankets, warm clothes, food, hygiene kits, water buckets, chlorine and dignity kits, to those who need it. Our partners have also deployed health teams and are providing trauma and emergency surgery kits. The Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan, Daniel Endres, has approved an emergency reserve allocation from the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund of $5 million to support the immediate relief efforts in the earthquake-impacted areas. **Ukraine This morning, theSecurity Councilheard from Rosemary DiCarlo, the Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs. She noted that in recent weeks, civilians and civilian infrastructure across Ukraine have remained under nearly constant fire. Ms. DiCarlo also said that the immediate impact of such attacks is clear, and just as clear is the fact that international humanitarian law obligates parties to armed conflict to protect non-combatants. She stressed that we will not waver in calling for accountability for anyone responsible for harming civilians during hostilities. Also briefing was Joyce Msuya, the number two at the Department of Humanitarian Affairs [Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator]. She said that since the attack on Hroza, the UN and humanitarian organizations have been on the scene, alongside local Ukrainian authorities, to ensure that people receive some support in the face of these atrocious attacks. Msuya warned that winter is yet again upon the people of Ukraine, adding that it is disturbing to see that attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure have already been reported over the past weeks. Both remarks have been shared with you. **Democratic Republic of the Congo Turning to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, our peacekeeping colleagues there tell us they are reinforcing their presence in Kitshanga, in North Kivu province, to protect civilians caught up in clashes between the M23 and members of other armed groups. Over the weekend, fresh fighting between these groups forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. Approximately 2,000 people have sought refuge within the UN Mission's base at Kitshanga and 18,000 men, women and children have taken shelter just outside the base. For its part, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that, since the first of October, clashes in Masisi territory in North Kivu have displaced nearly 85,000 people. This brings the total number of people displaced in the province to more than 2 million. These newly uprooted people have sought refuge in safer locations, including in other parts of Masisi territory and in Rutshuru. They have settled with host families or are sheltering in collective centres. Most of them are living in very precarious conditions, as one can only imagine. As a result of the clashes, road traffic is restricted between Goma and Kitshanga. Many of our humanitarian partners have suspended their movements to Kitshanga and its surrounding areas, as a result of fighting. **Somalia Turning to Somalia, the Humanitarian Coordinator there tell us that about 100,000 people have been impacted by last week's heavy rains and flash floods in the southern district of Baidoa. Shelters for more than 86,000 internally displaced people in 136 settlements were submerged, with most of them still flooded as we speak. In addition to shelter support, people impacted by the floods need food, water and medical care. Our humanitarian colleagues tell us that El Niño is expected to bring more rain and more flooding to Somalia through December — with at least 1.2 million people in riverine areas likely to be impacted by those heavy rains and flooding. We, along with our humanitarian partners, have worked with the Government to develop emergency preparedness and response plans — and the Somalia Humanitarian Fund has allocated $15 million for early action on flooding. But additional resources are urgently needed. This year's Humanitarian Appeal for Somalia is just 37 per cent funded. **Ethiopia Turning to Ethiopia: The World Food Programme today said that it has begun rolling out food distributions to nearly 900,000 refugees in Ethiopia, following a full revamp of the safeguards and controls at its refugee operations. Families living in refugee camps across five regions, including new arrivals who fled from Sudan, are receiving food parcels for the first time since WFP paused food distributions in June of this year, following reports of large-scale diversions of humanitarian supplies. WFP said that around 35,000 people who have fled from Sudan to Ethiopia in the last six months urgently require food assistance, while Ethiopia also hosts a further 850,000 refugees mostly from Somalia, South Sudan and Eritrea. The resumption of food distributions for refugees follows major reforms in all camps across the country. **Armenia Just a quick update from Armenia: Over the weekend, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), with other UN agencies and non-governmental organization (NGO) partners, have appealed for over $97 million to provide urgent humanitarian aid and protection to refugees and those generously hosting them in Armenia, in support of the Government-led response. The Armenia Emergency Refugee Response Plan was launched over the weekend. It covers relief efforts for a six-month period, until the end of March 2024. The joint plan aims to support 231,000 people including 136,000 refugees and 95,000 members of local host communities. The plan takes into account the upcoming harsh winter months, when critical support will be required. And yesterday, UNHCR said that another two trucks with humanitarian aid arrived in Armenia, carrying essential items such as blankets, foldable beds and mattresses, hygiene items, solar lamps and kitchen sets. **Internet Governance Forum We are almost there. In Kyoto, Japan, the Internet Governance Forum is underway. Today, the Secretary-General addressed the Forum in avideo messageand said we need to keep harnessing digital technologies enabled by the Internet to help deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), take climate action, and build a better world. He also underscored the need to close the connectivity gap around the world and re-enforce a human rights and human-centred approach to digital cooperation. ""It is imperative that the Internet — including the physical infrastructure that underpins it — remains open, secure, and accessible to all,"" he said. His remarks were shared with you. **World Post Day And sometimes, we make mistakes in this office. Last week, I erroneously announced to you that it was the official World Post Day. In fact, today is World Post day. The letter was late. **Questions and Answers Spokesman: A pretty grim day all around. Edie? Question: Thank you very much, Steph. A couple of follow-ups on the Middle East. Could you give us some specifics on what the UN and the Secretary-General are doing to prevent a spillover of the current conflict between Israel and Hamas into the broader region? And can you also give us some details on the size of the UN staff in Gaza? I assume that they can't leave and how... Spokesman: Sure. No, let's stop there for now because otherwise, I'll forget everything you've asked me. A couple of things. On the political activity, the Secretary-General and his Special Coordinator have been in close contact with international and regional actors, doing whatever to further the aim of [preventing] a spillover. And I think the Secretary-General mentioned that in his remarks. Just to give you some details, the Secretary-General has spoken to President [Chaim] Herzog. He expects to speak to Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu; also, he expects to speak to President [Mahmoud] Abbas today. He'll be speaking shortly with President [Abdelfattah al] Sisi. He already spoke to the King of Jordan, and we're also expecting him to speak to the Prime Minister of Lebanon. For his part, Mr. [Tor] Wennesland has been in touch with his counterparts from the US, from the European Union, from Egypt, Qatar, and Lebanon, and others. In terms of staff members, we have 13,000 colleagues, UNRWA colleagues in Gaza, national and international. The vast majority are nationals in Gaza. UNRWA has another about 4,000 staff members in the occupied West Bank. So those are our general, you know, and plus we have I'd say in terms of internationals, probably about around 300 in Gaza. They're obviously not able to leave. They are focused on trying to do whatever they can to help the population within their mandate. Question: And two quick follow-ups on that. With all of the aerial bombardments going on at the moment, are they able to deliver any kind of assistance? You're talking about trying to get 800,000 people given assistance —how are you going to be able to do that? And who will represent the UN or be on the sidelines at the Arab League Foreign Ministers meeting in Cairo on Wednesday? Spokesman: On your last question, I don't know. I will find out if we have a presence there. On the aid, I think as I just read out, WFP is already starting to roll out food distribution. UNRWA is doing whatever it can to feeding people that are sheltering in their schools. Ibtisam? Correspondent: Thank you, Steph. Just a quick follow-up on the last point. I thought the Israelis announced a total siege so that no one can get in and out. Spokesman: Yeah. That's what I said. Correspondent: So, yeah, I know. Spokesman: That's right. Correspondent: But when you say the UNRWA is starting to or will start... Spokesman: It's stuff that's pre-positioned. Correspondent: Already appeared... Spokesman: Yeah, we have supplies that are pre-positioned. Those supplies are not endless. Right? So at some point, in the not-too-distant future, we will run out of supplies unless more supplies can come in. Question: And my question is, you know, when hearing the Secretary-General today, I think for a lot of Palestinians, they would say that they have the feeling that there is a double standard — the way also the UN is dealing with the Palestinian issue compared to, for example, Ukraine. And if I look at his speech, he's talking, when it comes to kill Palestinian civilians, he's talking about being alarmed. But when it comes to kill Israeli civilians, he is condemning that. So how do you explain that? Spokesman: I think the Secretary-General and all of us are heartbroken at the loss of any civilian life. And you can do an analysis of the terminology that has been used over the years. The loss of civilian life is exactly that and is to be deplored. Correspondent: Yeah. But, I mean, sorry, I have to push back. But you are not using the same words to describe the loss of civilian life and that's a fact. Spokesman: No. No. I'm not arguing. In fact, I'm just, you know, we say what we say. As I said, we'll leave it to you to analyse. I feel I've answered the question to the best of my ability. Question: Okay. I have a follow-up regarding the school, the UNRWA school that was attacked. If I'm remembering right, UNRWA school and UN facilities are always very well-known for the Israelis. So is this also the case in this? I mean, that there are civilians there. There is a... you're very correct. There is a deconfliction process that exists. This is, sadly, not the first time that we're seeing... that the people of Gaza are seeing this, and it's not the first time that UNRWA has had to deal with it. UN premises are indeed well-known. As I said, there's a deconfliction mechanism with the other Israeli authorities. We're not in a position to know whether it was targeted or if it was a mistake. What we do know is that it was hit. And that UN schools should not be hit in any way, in any matter or form. Benno, then Pam, then Dezhi. Question: Thank you, Steph. Just a follow-up to Ibtisam. When you say pre-positioned, you mean inside the Gaza Strip? Spokesman: Yes. That's exactly what I mean. And then my question is the European Union Commission announced that it would freeze all aid to Palestinians. I am not exactly sure if this also contains money for UNRWA. Do you...? Spokesman: Well, we would very much hope that the funding for UN activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and in Gaza, including UNRWA, be protected. Question: Does that mean you didn't get any notice so far? Spokesman: I think we're seeing the developments as you're seeing them. We appeal that that funding for critical UN work, as I've just laid it out, is protected. Pam, then Benno, then Mike. Correspondent: Thanks, Steph. Of the... Spokesman: Sorry. Dezhi, Benno, Benny. Correspondent: Whatever. Spokesman: I confuse them all the time. I know. Question: Yeah. Right. The 13,000 UNRWA staff? Question: Right? Isn't that what you just said? Spokesman: Yes, ma'am. Question: In Gaza? Spokesman: Indeed. Question: And have they been asked to leave? I mean, is there a statement? Spokesman: I mean, the vast majority are Palestinians who live in Gaza. It's their home as well as their workplace. Correspondent: Right. Spokesman: No one can leave. Question: Is there any way to... I mean, are you doing anything to protect? Spokesman: Well, we're trying to do whatever we can to keep our people safe, and our people are also doing whatever they can to help the people they are mandated to help. Question: Alright. And in terms of travel to the Middle East, needless to say, this is not the moment. But this Secretary-General and previous, you were on the one that I was on with, Ban Ki-moon to Khan Yunis. Is there any interest in getting to the region? Spokesman: I have nothing to share with you on that at this moment. Correspondent: Okay. Spokesman: Dezhi, and then Mike. Question: A couple of questions. First, just now the Secretary-General mentioned the Hamas attack is an act of terror. So this is a terrorist attack. Is that correct? Spokesman: Well, those are the words he used. Yes. So the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Netanyahu, said it's a war now. Does the UN think this is now a war? Spokesman: I think what we are extremely concerned about is a level of tension that we've not seen before, a level of violence that we have not seen before and a risk of spillover that we have not seen before in the recent past. Question: Does the Secretary-General think that his talk to President Abbas of Palestine could really give this situation under control, especially for Hamas? Spokesman: I think the Secretary-General needs to speak to whomever he needs to speak to. And he's doing it at his level. The Special Coordinator is doing the same at his level. Question: And one last question, a follow-up on Ibtisam's question. You know, when I came here in this room, I've never heard anything about the condemnation of the Israelis' act on the Palestinians. You only condemned the Palestinians' attack on Israel. Do you think the UN bears responsibility for today's attack because of this double standard and competence? Correspondent: But you didn't do any... You're asking me a question, Dezhi. Yeah, exactly. Spokesman: And my answer is no. Mike? Two questions for you. Number one, you mentioned there's a deconfliction mechanism to try to avoid Israeli strikes on the UN facilities in Gaza. Is there any kind of mechanism to ensure — because we've seen it documented, well documented in the past, that Hamas and other terror groups are not occupying those facilities at any given time? How does that work where? Is there any alert between UN personnel on the ground? Spokesman: Well, we have made it perfectly clear that UN premises should obviously not be targeted but should not be used as offensive cover, so to speak. And that message has been passed on over and over again. We're seeing it in the Palestinian camp in Lebanon — exactly where we've called on the armed groups to leave the school. Question: Is there a procedure in place though to make sure that civilians...? Spokesman: I mean, the message is being... It is not acceptable for UN premises to be used by armed groups to shelter weapons or to launch offensive. Question: Is there a procedure in place though? I mean, the messages are passed. We live there. Yeah. Question: Does the UN personnel on the ground say to those civilians, ""hey, this is not safe anymore because this is now occupied by militant forces""? How does that work? Spokesman: Well, we ask the militant forces not to use the UN premises. We need to do whatever we can to keep those civilians who are seeking shelter in UN premises safe. Correspondent: One last question for you. Spokesman: Yes, sir. Question: Especially during these conflicts, proportionality is often talked about. I know the Secretary-General was upset that the Israeli actions in Jenin a few months ago during counter-terrorism operations there against Hamas militants. Eight hundred dead, beheadings, rapes, kidnappings of children. What does the Secretary-General deem as a proportionate response to this? Spokesman: It's not for him to set a proportionate response. If you look at what the Secretary-General just said, I think you'll find the answer to your question. Nabil, and then Sherwin. Question: I'm trying to read the Secretary-General's statement carefully. I don't see that he called for a ceasefire. Does he call for a ceasefire? Spokesman: Well, we want to see an end to this cycle of violence. Question: No. Because in his statement, he called on the Hamas and Jihad to stop their attacks and release the hostages immediately. Does he also call on Israel...? Spokesman: We would like to see an end to this cycle of violence. Question: And is the UN doing anything to mediate between the parties on the hostages now? Spokesman: I will just leave it to say that Mr. Wennesland is in touch at the working level with a number of parties. Question: And on the political level, does the Secretary-General have a plan of action? I mean, obviously, he's calling for a negotiated solution, but for the immediate situation, can you share with us if he has any plan of action — how to start the de-escalation? Spokesman: You know, this is... we need to see the international community and those in the region who have influence over the parties to all speak with one voice. And that's the aim of the phone calls that he's making and that Tor Wennesland is making. Question: Another question. The Secretary-General has already planned a trip to the region. Is he still planning to go there? Spokesman: As I said, if I have any travel to share with you, I will share it with you. Sherwin Bryce-Pease, South African Broadcasting. Question: Steph, thanks so much. The Secretary-General said in his remarks that the most recent violence does not come in a vacuum. So given the years long absence of any confidence-building measures towards direct negotiations, the growing radicalization we are seeing on both sides, the changing of the geography on the ground, on what basis does he continue to argue for a two-state solution? Asked a different way, there's a narrative out there that a two-state solution is purely becoming a fantasy, given the changes we are seeing on the ground. On what basis do you still argue for a two-state solution? Spokesman: Because we feel it's what is in the relevant resolutions passed by the Member States of this organization. And the Secretary-General continues to feel it is the only way forward. Now, we're also not blind. We understand that there are people creating facts on the ground. And every time those facts on the ground are changed, it pushes us in the wrong direction. It does not mean we will not stop pushing for the other direction. Correspondent: Surely, policy changes if reality changes. Spokesman: We adapt, but the goal... at this point, the goal for us is not changing. Stefano, and then madam... Question: Thank you, Stéphane. The Secretary-General, when he start this mandate, he did several speech of which one, in particular, the first speech, on the Security Council, he said that prevention is not merely a priority, but the priority. He was talking about prevention of conflict. After we saw in Ukraine and after we seen in the Middle East now, does he think that this policy that he announced — and he was not only talking about himself, he was talking, of course, about the UN in general, so the Security Council — is a total failure now? Spokesman: The Secretary-General is not the person with the finger on the trigger. He and his envoys have continued to do whatever they can to do preventive diplomacy. In the end, leaders are acting in a way that leads us to a situation that we see. Question: But does he thinks that he did everything he needs in his power? Spokesman: I think he feels he did everything that he could have. Evelyn, and then Celhia. To the atrocities in Israel, is there a chance that they are going to overwhelm the atrocities in Ukraine as far as contributions and humanitarian aid? Spokesman: Evelyn, that's not a question for me to answer. That's an analysis question. We think that we should pay attention to all these crises. But where that... how that attention is paid is offered in the hands of the media. I mean, look at what I've read out today. I've read out about what's going on in Gaza, what's going on in Israel, what's going on in Ethiopia, what's going on in the DRC, what's going on in Somalia. We do our bit. Celhia? Question: [inaudible] Spokesman: I don't know. I don't know. Question: Talking about the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Earlier, you said that armed groups in North Kivu are still fighting. The UN has been asked to leave the country. Would you say that the UN failed to stop the fighting in North Kivu? Spokesman: There's a lot of UN failure questions today. I think, you know, many, many of our colleagues, many peacekeepers have lost their lives in the Congo, doing their job, trying to protect civilians. UN peacekeeping is there to create a space in which political leaders need to live up to their responsibilities. And I think in many places, those political leaders have not lived up to their responsibilities. And is that the fault of UN peacekeeping efforts? No — to paraphrase my answer to Dezhi. Alan, let's see if somebody can get me in a better mood. Question: That's right. I have a question regarding the Middle East Quartet. Are there any movements in this format? And does the Secretary-General rely on this format in this critical hour? Spokesman: I mean, there's been no... Let me put it this way. There's been no official movement that I'm aware of. The Quartet is a useful mechanism that brings the international community together, but we are only 25 per cent of that Quartet, a mere slice. Yes, sir? As you know, since last Thursday, Türkiye has been bombing north-east Syria and last night, they killed 29 Kurdish internal security forces. Also, they targeted some agricultural workers, and they injured five [inaudible] women. I wonder if Secretary-General had a chance to get in touch with Turkish officials recently. And plus, is UN going to send any help to build those civilian infrastructure in north-east Syria because of the, for example, like power stations? Spokesman: I need to check on the humanitarian aspect... north-east Syria. As far as I know, the Secretary-General at his level has not been in touch, but we can check with Mr. [Geir] Pedersen on that end. Okay. Round two. Question: Just a quick follow-up on what Benno asked you about regarding the European Union and them stopping or announcing that they will stop their aid. As you said, you didn't get an announcement when it comes to the UN. But I guess my question is, even if they will not stop the aid to the UN, they will stop it, it seems to be to local NGOs. Do you consider this as being part of collective punishment? Spokesman: I think those men, women and children, and those people who often live in the most vulnerable conditions who rely on humanitarian aid, who are the least responsible for the situation, should not pay a price. Question: And I have a question about Syria and cross-border. Because there is the two other cross-borders that they will expire in, I think, in a month. The Bab al-Salam and... Spokesman: It's a lifetime. Any updates there? Spokesman: I will check. I don't mean to minimize it, but I will. I will check. Benno, then Pam. Correspondent: Maybe I'd try a Security Council failure question then. Spokesman: I will not... that's not for me to answer. Question: Well, does the Secretary-General have a comment or, like, a message to the Security Council? They met yesterday on the Middle East, and, obviously, there was no outcome. I think they didn't try to get an outcome... to have an outcome, but still, there must be maybe a message from the Secretary-General to the council. Spokesman: The Secretary-General's message to Security Council is the same as it always has been, is that a strong and unified Security Council helps all of us in our collective action to avoid further violence or to improve situation around the world. Pamela? You mentioned that the SG spoke with Sisi and Abbas and Herzog and Lebanon. I mean, he spoke with a lot of people. Spokesman: I mentioned that he spoke to some and he will speak to others. That's in my list. Question: Yes. Can you give us some sense? I mean, I know there are readouts, but what are the world leaders in the region saying about... Spokesman: Listen, I struggle enough to speak on behalf of the Secretary-General. I cannot speak on behalf of his interlocutors. What are they telling him? Spokesman: Listen, you know how much the Secretary-General prizes discretion. And how much I prize my job. So Dezhi? Question: I have an easier question. Today, we discovered that the NYPD [New York Police Department] is actually strengthening security around the United Nations Headquarters. Is that related to what the situation in Palestinian and Israel is? Spokesman: I think you need to ask them. We rely and are extremely grateful for what the NYPD does for us. I mean, we've seen, I think, over the weekend, there were counter-demonstrations not far from here. So the NYPD does to keep whatever it needs to do to keep all of us safe. Stefano? Question: Yes, it's a follow-up of what just Pam asked. Did the Secretary-General intend... did he speak or intend to speak with President [Joseph] Biden? And will he ask him to intervene in the situation about the sparing of civilians in this fighting? Spokesman: The Secretary-General's calls right now are focused to political leaders in the region. Edie, then I'm definitely out of here and leaving you in Monica's hands. Question: On Afghanistan. Has the UN been able to get its people into this area of Herat which is not so easy to get to? We're trying to send an assessment team there. The transport and access are always a little challenging. As soon as we have more info, I'll let you know. Monica, over to you.","['unitedstates', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'afghanistan', 'afghanistan', 'afghanistan', 'afghanistan', 'afghanistan', 'afghanistan', 'afghanistan', 'afghanistan', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'not found', 'not found', 'democraticrepublicofthecongo', 'democraticrepublicofthecongo', 'democraticrepublicofthecongo', 'democraticrepublicofthecongo', 'democraticrepublicofthecongo', 'democraticrepublicofthecongo', 'democraticrepublicofthecongo', 'democraticrepublicofthecongo', 'democraticrepublicofthecongo', 'congo', 'congo', 'congo', 'japan', 'japan', 'japan', 'southafrica', 'southafrica', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'southsudan', 'eritrea', 'armenia', 'armenia', 'armenia', 'jordan', 'us', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'qatar', 'turkey', 'malaysia', 'malaysia', 'malaysia', 'syria', 'syria', 'syria', 'syria', 'brazil']",us,True,False

More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm. Some children, like 10-year-old Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim, are already on the move. Her family left their home in Somalia after dawn prayers on a Saturday morning five months ago. The worst drought in more than 50 years scorched the once-fertile pastures the family relied on, leaving them barren. So, bundling only a few clothes and some utensils into sacks, they moved to a camp in the capital Mogadishu, where Ibrahim, who dreams of being a doctor, is now going to school for the first time. That’s a plus, but the camp lacks proper shelter and sanitation, and food is scarce. “We need something that can protect us from the heat during the day and the cold at night,” Ibrahim said. The miseries of long, drawn-out disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report — more than half of them in Somalia — but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no pre-emptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide, climate change has already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines; storms are battering megacities and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. “The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in (the) future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify,” said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the report's authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 2016-21 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. Floods displaced children more than 19 million times in places like India and China. Wildfires impacted children 810,000 times in the U.S. and Canada. Data tracking migrations because of weather extremes typically don't differentiate between children and adults. UNICEF worked with a Geneva-based nonprofit, the International Displacement Monitoring Center, to map where kids were most impacted. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. Those countries also have vast populations and strong systems to evacuate people, which makes it easier for them to record data. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring “overlapping crises” — where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. During unprecedented flooding of the Yamuna River in July in the Indian capital New Delhi, churning waters washed away the hut that was home to 10-year-old Garima Kumar’s family. The waters also took her school uniform and her school books. Kumar lived with her family on sidewalks of the megacity and missed a month of school. “Other students in the school teased me because my house had been flooded. Because we don’t have a permanent home,” Kumar said. The floodwaters have receded and the family began repairing their home last month — a process Garima’s mother Meera Devi said they are having to do over and over again as floods are becoming more common. Her father, Shiv Kumar, hasn’t had any work for over a month. The family's only income is the mother’s $2 daily earnings as a domestic helper. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnam-based expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasn’t involved with the report. “When you’re desperate, you do things that you normally wouldn’t do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they don’t have the ability to stand up for themselves,” she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become “shock-responsive, portable and inclusive,” to help children and their families better cope with disasters. This would mean considering children’s needs at different stages, from ensuring they have opportunities to study, that they can stay with their families and that eventually they can find work. “We have the tools. We have the knowledge. But we’re just not working fast enough,” Healy said. ___ Ghosal reported from Hanoi, Vietnam, Fassett reported from Seattle.

New York 19 October 2023 The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Farhan Haq, Deputy Spokesman for the Secretary-General. Alright, good afternoon, everyone. **Egypt As you may just have seen, the Secretary-General arrived in Cairo earlier this morning as part of a humanitarian mission at a moment of profound crisis in the region. He was briefed on the latest humanitarian situation by his senior officials in the region. Just a few hours ago, the Secretary-General met with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. In remarks to the press after the meeting, the Secretary-General reiterated his call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. In plain terms, that means humanitarian workers need to be able to get the aid in — and they need to be able to distribute it safely. For nearly two weeks, Mr. [António] Guterres said, the people of Gaza have gone without any shipments of fuel, food, water, medicine and other essentials. All these things are needed at scale and in a sustainable manner. The Secretary-General said that through its actions and its openness, Egypt is showing how it is a pillar of multilateral cooperation and a linchpin in helping to defuse tensions and ease colossal human pain and suffering. He added that we know that the longer this goes on, the greater the risk of the violence spilling over. **Gaza In Gaza, the number of people internally displaced is estimated at about 1 million, including about 353,000 people staying in UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) schools in central and southern Gaza. They are living in increasingly dire conditions. For the ninth consecutive day, Gaza is under a full electricity blackout. Hospitals are on the brink of collapse. They are operating at a bare-minimum capacity and are struggling to keep emergency rooms operational, and are suspending some surgeries, working in darkness and limiting elevator usage. The World Health Organization (WHO) has documented 59 attacks on health-care personnel and assets, with 16 health-care workers killed and more than two dozen others injured. Twenty-six health-care facilities have been damaged, as well as 23 ambulances. Water production from municipal groundwater sources is at less than 5 per cent of the level prior to the latest crisis. The lack of fuel, insecurity and road damage have brought water trucking operations to a halt in most areas. Our partners estimate that the average water consumption from all sources and for all needs has dropped to three litres per day per person. According to the World Health Organization, between 50 and 100 litres of water per person per day are needed to ensure that most basic needs are met, and fewer health concerns arise. Despite immense challenges, the World Food Programme (WFP) has been providing food and cash assistance each day for a total of 522,000 Palestinians since the start of the crisis. WFP says that commercial stocks of essential food commodities are running low. At the shop level, stocks will last only for a few days more. Retailers can't restock from wholesalers due to widespread destruction and insecurity. **Somalia This morning, Catriona Laing, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the UN Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM),briefedthe Security Council on the situation in Somalia. She noted that conflicts in Somalia continue to take a heavy toll on civilians. Ms. Laing pointed out that last year, we saw the largest increase in civilian casualties since 2017, and sadly, early data indicate a similar trend in 2023, with 1,289 civilian casualties recorded so far. She said that this is partly attributable to Al-Shabaab attacks, but also the conflict in Laascaanood. Laing said that the humanitarian crisis in Somalia remains deeply concerning, with close to 4 million people continuing to be food insecure and in need of assistance. She stressed that it is essential that we scale up programmes that tackle the underlying drivers of the humanitarian crisis and integrate humanitarian response with longer-term climate adaptation. Her full remarks have been shared with you. **Yemen The Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, concluded a visit to Riyadh today where he met senior Yemeni, regional and international officials and diplomats. Discussions focused on next steps to facilitate an agreement on measures to improve living conditions in Yemen, a nationwide ceasefire, and an inclusive intra-Yemeni political process under UN auspices. In his meeting with the President of the Yemeni Presidential Leadership Council, Rashad al Alimi, Mr. Grundberg stressed that Yemen is going through a critical juncture that still has the potential of bringing Yemenis closer to the just peace they aspire to. The Special Envoy also held meetings with the Secretary General of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Jasem al Budaiwi, and with the Saudi Ambassador to Yemen, Mohamed al Jaber, as well as the P5 Ambassadors to Yemen. **Central African Republic And in the Central African Republic, our peacekeeping mission — the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) — tells us they've launched a joint project with the Government in Bambari, Ouaka Prefecture, to help reintegrate 750 ex-combatants and 750 members of host communities. Work has begun with the first group of ex-combatants and community members. The $5 million project, financed by the Peacebuilding Fund, will also be implemented in the Prefectures of Basse-Kotto, Mbomou and Haut-Mbomou over the next two years and could be extended to other locations. The project is part of ongoing efforts to support the implementation of the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation and the joint road map of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, which aims to restore security throughout the country. **Libya Turning to Libya, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs tells us that, five weeks after Storm Daniel brought catastrophic flooding to the country's north-east, more than 43,000 people are still displaced — over one third of them in Derna. The Office says that an estimated 400 children are still unaccompanied and separated from their families. The World Health Organization reports that only 17 of more than 230 health facilities assessed after the floods are fully functional. The UN and our partners have reached some 156,000 people with humanitarian assistance, including food, safe drinking water, shelter supplies and other essential items. Our three-month Flash Appeal for $71 million to respond to the floods in Libya is currently 45 per cent funded. **Sudan Turning to Sudan, we have an update from our humanitarian colleagues on our efforts to deliver life-saving assistance in Kordofan and Darfur. Yesterday, 18 October, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs facilitated 44 trucks with relief supplies to Kordofan and Darfur. Prior to this, the movement of supplies was delayed for six consecutive weeks due to insecurity. The convoy is transporting supplies from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food Programme and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). Regarding the health situation in the country, the World Health Organization says that more than 1,400 suspected cases of cholera and 64 associated deaths have been reported in Sudan since a cholera outbreak was declared late last month. Humanitarian agencies have scaled up their response to the outbreak, which comes as Sudan's health-care system is stretched to its limits. **Venezuela You will have seen that, yesterday afternoon, we issued astatementin which the Secretary-General welcomed the partial agreement announced by the Government of Venezuela and the Unitary Platform of Venezuela signed in Barbados. The Secretary-General commended the efforts of regional and international partners and encouraged the implementation, in good faith, of Venezuelan-led agreements to lead to inclusive, transparent, and credible elections next year, as well as to address human rights concerns. **Senior Personnel Announcement And last, we have a senior personnel announcement. Today, the Secretary-General isappointingAndrea Cook of the United Kingdom as Executive Director of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group System Wide Evaluation Office. The Secretary-General wishes to extend his appreciation to Matthew Varghese who served as Acting Executive Director. Cook brings to this position 30 years of experience in development, humanitarian assistance and evaluation, including roles in the United Nations and the United Kingdom Government. Most recently, Ms. Cook served as Director of Evaluation for the World Food Programme in Rome — from 2017 to 2023. And there are lots more online. There is no briefing from Monica [Grayley] today, so you just have me. What do you have for questions? Yes, please. **Questions and Answers Question: Hi, Serhii Barbu, Ukrainian TV Channel 5. Ukraine can send 72,000 tons of grain to Nigeria and Sudan as part of the humanitarian food programme ""Grain from Ukraine"". This was reported by a press service of the Ukrainian Government. Is the UN involved in this process? It's first question. And second, and is there any point in the future negotiation between the UN and Russia about the Black Sea Grain Initiative? Deputy Spokesman: To take your second question first, yes, there is a point. We want to make sure that we can go back to having sustained regular commercial exports of food and fertilizer from both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, which ultimately is beneficial overall for the world and helpful to prevent a rise in world food prices. Regarding the efforts by Ukraine unilaterally, the United Nations isn't involved in those, but we certainly appreciate all efforts to make sure that these food exports go out into international markets. Question: Do you have any news about this negotiation with Russia? Because last days, weeks, months is without any news. Deputy Spokesman: We're continuing with our efforts, and we will continue with those, including through our senior humanitarian relief official, Martin Griffiths, and through the head of our office of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Rebeca Grynspan. Sylviane? Question: Thank you, Farhan. There is resumption of artillery exchanges at the south border of Lebanon and Israel. And the German Defence Minister, Boris Pistorius, is actually in Lebanon. He warned against withdrawing the peacekeeping mission operation in Lebanon, UNIFIL [United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon], given the major escalation between Israel and Hamas. Is the peacekeeping operation in Lebanon in clear danger, really? And how can the UN preserve Lebanon from the impact of the Gaza war? Deputy Spokesman: Well, first of all, I want to emphasize that our peacekeeping force in Lebanon, the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, is continuing with its tasks. It's not going anywhere and it's continuing with its activities and working to defuse tensions along the Blue Line. The situation across the Blue Line remains concerning, with exchanges of fire overnight and today. UNIFIL peacekeepers remain in their positions and continue their operations in line with the mission's mandate, including patrolling. And we again urge all actors to exercise restraint, seize hostilities and avoid further escalation. Ibtisam? Question: A follow-up, please? Number of countries have asked their citizen and national to leave the country… to leave Lebanon. Do you have any message from the UN to Lebanon? Deputy Spokesman: Well, those are bilateral decisions that they certainly can take if their Governments deem that necessary. But, what I'm saying from our end is that the UN is staying in place. Question: But, is Lebanon is in clear danger of war? Deputy Spokesman: The evaluations that other governments make is for them to make. From our standpoint, we're doing everything we can to keep the situation as calm as possible. Yes. Ibtisam, and then Dezhi. Question: Farhan, there are some news reports about 20 trucks supposedly supposed to go to Gaza from Egypt. Can you confirm that what exactly… is the UN even involved? Deputy Spokesman: Well, I can't confirm that. As you heard from the Secretary-General, he is there in Cairo, along with Martin Griffiths and Rosemary DiCarlo, his top humanitarian and political officials. And we are in touch with the Egyptian authorities and others to do what we can to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. There's no announcement to make at this stage on that. But, from the Secretary-General's standpoint, what he has made clear is what we need is to have sustained humanitarian access. And so we want to make sure that we can have not just one convoy, but a constant flow of the needed humanitarian aid. Question: So do you, I mean, from your point of view, Israel is still having the complete siege on Gaza and you're not allowed to enter anything from any crossing, whether crossing with Israel or Rafah, is this what you're getting from the Israelis? Deputy Spokesman: We are in touch with a wide number of officials, including officials in Israel, and we're doing what we can, again, to have sustained humanitarian access into Gaza. The situation, as reported at the start of the briefing, as you know, is very, very grim, and we need to get progress on this immediately. Question: Okay. I have another question, sorry, about the Occupied Palestinian Territory in the West Bank. There are a lot of reports about, not only in the West Bank and Jerusalem, but also even inside Israel, attacks against Palestinians inside Israel, arrests. Also, I think, if I'm not mistaken, 60 people in the West Bank and Jerusalem were killed by Israeli forces and by settlers. Can you confirm that? Can we have more updates on what's going on in the West Bank? Deputy Spokesman: Yes. In fact, you will have heard yesterday both Tor Wennesland, our Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, and Martin Griffiths spoke to the council. They made very clear their concerns about the violence not just in Gaza and Israel, but also in the West Bank. Mr. Griffiths made clear that the level of violence, the level of killings, over the past, since 7 October in the West Bank has been the largest amount, really since 2005. So, it's a matter of grave concern, and we are working to see what can be done to de-escalate the situation there. And I just refer you to what they've said yesterday. Dezhi? Question: A couple of clarifications. After yesterday, the Israeli Foreign Ministry announced that they will let limited humanitarian aid [into] Gaza. Has there been any humanitarian aids that cross the border or cross line into Gaza? Deputy Spokesman: Not so far. Correspondent: Not so far. Deputy Spokesman: We'll let you know what happens once something does happen. Question: Second thing, will the Secretary-General go to Rafah border crossing tomorrow? Deputy Spokesman: At this stage, the situation is fairly fluid. We'll let you know if he has further travels once that happens. Question: So, on one hand, we know that the Israeli Government, they decided to get a limited humanitarian aid into Gaza Strip. On the other hand, the Defence Minister of Israel today said they will soon start the ground offensive in Gaza. We know that the Secretary-General reiterated his position for a ceasefire. What message does the Secretary-General have for Israel? Deputy Spokesman: I think the message is one that he's made very clear. He wants a humanitarian ceasefire. He wants it immediately, and we want aid to go in to the people who need it immediately. Question: So… sorry. So, speaking of delivering this message, we know there's one person in the pipeline that the Secretary-General still hasn't been able to talk with, which is the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. [Benjamin] Netanyahu. Is there any new schedule for them to talk? Deputy Spokesman: If he does have that, we'll let you know at that point. Yes, Ephrem? Question: Thank you. Just a quick follow-up. Is Mr. Netanyahu not picking up the phone when the Secretary-General is calling or why haven't they talked in 12 days? Deputy Spokesman: I don't speak for the Israeli side at all. What I can tell you is that the Secretary-General has spoken with a number of officials and we've given you updates on those. He has not spoken with the Prime Minister yet. He did speak with the President of Israel, Isaac Herzog. My question, I'm trying to understand why the visit to Egypt and what expectations does the Secretary-General have from this visit. The aim is, as you said, to discuss humanitarian flow into Gaza, but Egypt is not the problem. The problem is the siege and the refusal to open the border. So, what is it that why is he going to Egypt? What's the importance of this visit? What does he expect from Egyptian authorities? What can they do? Deputy Spokesman: The Egyptian authorities can indeed be helpful. And if you've heard what he had to say in Cairo to the press, he talked about the role that Egypt is playing. But, beyond that, the bottom line is that talks are ongoing regarding humanitarian access. Those talks are being held in Cairo and there are contacts being made with people in Israel and in other areas. And we believe we're moving forward and we're doing what we can to make progress on this as quickly as we can. Let me go to the screens and then I'll go back over. So first, I believe Margaret Besheer. Question: Farhan, yesterday, I think you told us 3,000 tons of supplies are in Egypt ready to go. I just wanted to know if you have an update on the number has more gone in that's still current. Deputy Spokesman: There've been no deliveries into Gaza that we can say just yet. We're hoping… Correspondent: No, no, no, Farhan. That stuff you're stockpiling in Egypt. Yesterday, you said there was about 3,000 tons… I think 3,000 tons of supplies. Deputy Spokesman: Yeah. At this point, the issue is getting aid in to Gaza from Egypt. And there's nothing… Question: But, that's not my question. My question is how much supplies does the UN have in Egypt at El-Arish and at Rafah are ready to go once you get the green light? I'm just trying to get the updated number. Deputy Spokesman: The number I gave you yesterday is still the number. And we have, I believe, a large number of trucks that are ready. But, there's nothing to confirm at this point in terms of what will be able to go in. Kristen? Question: And I think yesterday, sorry… yesterday, you also said I think it was normally 100 trucks a day would go to Gaza. So, when you say you have a large number of trucks ready, do you know roughly what that would be? It's a similar sort of number as that. It's about 100 trucks, but I don't want to get caught up on numbers of trucks just yet. And part of the point is we want to make sure that these things, as the Secretary-General himself made clear in Cairo, are not a one-off. What we need is sustained access. And so, we're trying to make sure that we can get a large number of trucks going in on a regular basis. Kristen and then we'll… Question: And just, sorry, just one more point. Sorry. Just one more point, to be clear. So, the 20 trucks that are supposedly going to be allowed to cross on Friday, those are not UN trucks? UN is not part of this announcement that [Joseph R.] Biden made, right? Is that what you're saying? Deputy Spokesman: I think we will be able to comment more about what's going in once we have agreement on what is going in. I don't want to get caught up on that just yet. It's still being discussed. Kristen, and then Stefano. Question: Thanks, Farhan. Given the Secretary-General's call for a humanitarian ceasefire has so far been unanswered, what is the UN telling Palestinians in Gaza? Where are you advising that they go, given there are reports of an imminent ground invasion? Deputy Spokesman: We are not telling people to go anywhere. We want them to be safe and protected wherever they are. It's very clear under international humanitarian law and international human rights law that civilians need to be safe in the areas where they are. And we are emphasising that and we will continue to emphasise for that. Stefano? Question: But, given a UN school and hospitals have been hit, is there any advice that you can give to the people there? Deputy Spokesman: Well, we're aware of that. And as you've noticed, we've spoken out against any attacks on our facilities. That's still been happening, but we do have de-confliction mechanisms in place. They know where our facilities are, and we continue to emphasize that all parties must abide by international humanitarian law. This is a follow-up on a question that was asked to you yesterday by several of my colleagues. It's about the veto the United States had on the Security Council yesterday. Your answer, if I understand it, is you say, well, the Secretary-General know that there [are] divisions in the Security Council. I hope that soon they will find a unified position. But, yesterday wasn't a problem of a division. The humanitarian resolution had everything that the Russian resolution didn't have. And the explanation was actually done by the US ambassador herself. She said because the president is there, we had to let diplomats work the field. So basically, she said we had to wait. Now, the question is does the Secretary-General think after what happened yesterday, that Security Council is irrelevant? Deputy Spokesman: Stefano, I get this particular question every month for the last 20 years or so. And the fact of the matter is the Security Council is relevant, and you can tell that it's relevant because all of you are in this room, all the time, asking about the things the Security Council does. If it were irrelevant, that wouldn't happen. Question: Just a quick follow-up. But, yesterday, asking the Chinese ambassador, they were so kind. It was one of the few ambassadors that came to talk because all the others left. We were asking why you don't present then, you know, why China doesn't present right away as soon as possible another resolution. His answer to us was, did you see what happened? They don't care. He's not… Deputy Spokesman: Stefano, with all due respect, I'm not going to get involved in discussions between ambassadors and us. Correspondent: But, you didn't answer what the Secretary-General think. Deputy Spokesman: I've told you what the Secretary-General thinks. We know that this is a topic on which Council members are divided. They've been divided on this many times in the past. We are pleading for them to come to a united position, which will strengthen efforts to deal with this crisis peacefully. Evelyn, and then we'll go back to the screens. Correspondent: Thank you, Farhan. Sir, I have my name, Farhan. I was the first to put my name… Deputy Spokesman: Abdelhamid, with all due respect, I said Evelyn, and then we'll go back to the screens. Evelyn? Does Israel have to okay the supplies from Egypt if they come that are expected? And excuse me, if so, will the badly needed fuel be allowed in that both civilians and Hamas can use? Deputy Spokesman: We're in touch with all of the various parties to make sure we can get humanitarian goods in. We've emphasized the need for all humanitarian goods, that includes food, that includes water, that includes medicine and that includes fuel. Now, I will turn to Abdelhamid. Correspondent: I apologize, Farhan, because I put my name first person. You took the three journalists after me. That's why I was. I thought you couldn't see my name. Deputy Spokesman: I don't know the order of people who are written down. All I know is what I see in front of me and what I see on this phone. Anyway… Question: I have a few questions and I hope you will be patient with me. The first, today, 10 Palestinians were killed in Askar refugee camp near Nablus, 10 Palestinians, 14 were wounded, 4 of them gravely wounded and about over 50 Palestinians were arrested. That is today. There's no statement. There was no indication that the UN took note of killing Palestinians. Are the Palestinian blood is cheaper than the other side of the conflict? Deputy Spokesman: Well, Abdelhamid, as I pointed out, both Tor Wennesland and Martin Griffiths spoke on the issue of the killings of Palestinians, including in the West Bank and our concerns about that. Like I said just a few minutes ago, we are concerned that the level of killings in the West Bank has not been seen there since 2005. So, we need that to de-escalate. There's a lot of different fronts of this crisis, and we're trying to deal with all of them. What's your other question? Question: And my second question. I heard the Secretary-General in his press conference with Sameh Shoukry, the Egyptian Foreign Minister, and squarely, again, he puts the blame on the Palestinians. I mean, knowing that the background of the conflict and the siege of Gaza and the occupation and the settler violence and what happened in Jerusalem, how could he not indicate that this as a by-product of the occupation and the frustration and the operation and the attacks on Gaza, and he just as if the history started on 7 October? How could he do that? Deputy Spokesman: Without getting into the overall history of this, we have spoken out clearly and repeatedly, including in recent days, about the problems involving the occupation. That does not get away from the fact that what happened on 7 October was horrific. And that has been the start of the situation that we see right now. Iftikhar, and then we'll go back to the room. Question: My last question. Is okay? Can you? Deputy Spokesman: Sure. I read a statement issued by the Special Adviser on Genocide. Her name is Alice Wairimu Nderitu. And if you read this statement and you don't know anything about the conflict, you believe that the Palestinians are waging a genocidal war against Israel. How could a UN official of that level, of that calibre, issue such a statement and goes unchecked or unnoticed? How could she do that? I want you to look at that statement and give me a real comment on it. Deputy Spokesman: I will leave it to the Special Adviser to speak for herself, and you can contact her office on that. Can you hear me? Deputy Spokesman: Yes, I can. Question: By now, all the questions on the Gaza situation have been asked. But since I missed your intro, did you have an update on the earthquakes, the relief efforts in the earthquake in Afghanistan, the death toll, and the response to the appeal? Deputy Spokesman: Not today. In the last days, we have had updates on our efforts in Afghanistan. So, I would just refer you back to the last couple of days of briefings, but I didn't have anything new to say today on that. Linda? Also on the question, obviously, of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Yesterday, the US ambassador after the veto said that there's no doubt that she has great concern — that US has great concern for conditions in Gaza, but she made the point about I think what she's made several times is that the US holds Hamas' own action responsible for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, meaning actions in terms of 7 October, attacking Israel and Israel is retaliating. Deputy Spokesman: And what's your question? Question: My question is how does the UN respond to this? Is there a sense that the UN supports this concept or supports it in part or that kind of thing? Deputy Spokesman: Our evaluation of the situation is what you'll have seen in the statements made by the Secretary-General, by Tor Wennesland, by Martin Griffiths and others. Ibtisam, again. Question: Farhan, you keep or at least starting from yesterday, if I'm not mistaken, it was the first time that the Secretary-General called in clear words for a humanitarian ceasefire. What is not clear for me, what do you exactly mean by that? Deputy Spokesman: Just that there needs to be a halt to fighting to allow humanitarian aid to get in. Question: Yeah. But, does that mean that this halt to fighting is for a specific period in time and then Israel can go on? I mean, I guess my question here, is very simple. Why aren't you calling on ceasefire full stop? Deputy Spokesman: A humanitarian ceasefire is a ceasefire. Obviously, when you're calling for that, you're calling for parties to cease fire. There's no real difference in terms of that. A cessation of fire is for some period of time. What that period of time can be is up to what the parties are willing to agree to. Question: Why aren't you calling on a full cessation of hostilities? Deputy Spokesman: Ultimately, we're working to do what we can to get all fighting to stop. But, right now, what is essential and is essential immediately is a humanitarian ceasefire. Question: This question is supposed to be for Monica. There is a permanent member of the Security Council vetoed the draft resolution. So, technically speaking, there would be an explanation for the General Assembly. Does the Secretariat have any information when would that meeting will be held? Deputy Spokesman: I'm delighted to inform you that that is something that is in the hands of the President of the General Assembly, and therefore you will have to talk to Monica, who should be back tomorrow. Alright. Have a good afternoon, everyone.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'yemen', 'yemen', 'yemen', 'yemen', 'yemen', 'yemen', 'saudiarabia', 'centralafricanrepublic', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'venezuela', 'venezuela', 'barbados', 'unitedkingdom', 'italy', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'nigeria', 'russia', 'russia', 'russia', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'southafrica', 'southafrica', 'southafrica', 'southafrica', 'southafrica', 'southafrica', 'southafrica', 'southafrica', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'china', 'algeria', 'afghanistan', 'afghanistan']",us,True,False

According to the analysis, China and the Philippines are among the countries that recorded the highest absolute numbers of child displacements, due to their exposure to extreme weather, large child populations and progress made on early warning and evacuation capacities. However, relative to the size of the child population, children living in small island states, such as Dominica and Vanuatu, were most affected by storms , while children in Somalia and South Sudan were most affected by floods . Floods and storms accounted for 40.9 million, or 95 per cent, of recorded child displacements between 2016 and 2021. Meanwhile, droughts triggered more than 1.3 million internal displacements of children - with Somalia again among the most affected, while wildfires triggered 810,000 child displacements, with more than a third occurring in 2020 alone. Canada, Israel and the US recorded the most. The report also said that riverine floods have the potential to displace almost 96 million children over the next 30 years, based on current climate data, while cyclonic winds and storm surges have the potential to displace 10.3 million and 7.2 million children respectively, over the same period. ""It is terrifying for any child when a ferocious wildfire, storm or flood barrels into their community,"" said Unicef Executive Director Catherine Russell. ""For those who are forced to flee, the fear and impact can be especially devastating, with worry of whether they will return home, resume school, or be forced to move again.""

News and Media Division . New York 26 October 2023 The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General. **Press Briefings All right, good afternoon! As we told you, in a short while I will be joined by the Secretary-General, who will be here toannounce the members of his Advisory Board on Artificial Intelligence. He will be accompanied by his Envoy on Technology, Amandeep Singh Gill; the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Ilze Brands Kehris; and we will be joined virtually by colleagues from UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and UN University. The Secretary-Generalwill make a statement, but he will not take questions, the others will remain behind to speak on AI. **Gaza I want to give you a humanitarian update on Gaza. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reports that — over four consecutive days, from Saturday through Tuesday — 62 trucks travelled through the Rafah crossing from Egypt into Gaza, carrying water, food and medical supplies. Most of this aid has already reached hospitals, ambulances, and internally displaced persons (IDPs). However, the daily average of trucks allowed into Gaza prior to the hostilities was about 500. Fuel, which is desperately needed to run backup generators, remains banned, still unable to get into Gaza. As a result, the UN Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, has almost exhausted its fuel reserves and began significantly reducing its operations. An estimated 1.4 million people in Gaza are internally displaced, with some 629,000 sheltering in 150 UNRWA-designated emergency shelters. Overcrowding is a growing concern, as the average number of IDPs per shelter has now reached 2.7 times their designated capacity of each shelter. Water supply through the network in areas south of Wadi Gaza has temporarily improved. This happened after UNRWA and UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) managed to deliver small quantities of fuel they had retrieved from their existing reserves to key facilities. However, the available fuel in these facilities will be exhausted, fairly soon, and the supply of piped water is expected to cease again. Earlier today, Lynn Hastings, our Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, issued a statement, in which she said among other points, she stressed that the conduct of armed conflict, anywhere, is governed by international humanitarian law. This means that civilians must be protected and have essentials to survive, wherever they are and whether they choose to move or stay. She added that it also means that hostages — all hostages — must be released, immediately and unconditionally. **Lebanon Moving north to Lebanon, our colleagues at the UN Peacekeeping Mission in South Lebanon (UNIFIL) tell us that they remain in continuous contact with authorities on both sides of the Blue Line to urge restraint and respect for Security Council resolution 1701. The Mission reports that, earlier today, it detected firing between Lebanese territory and Israel, near Blida and near Aytaroun. They have also been working together with Lebanese authorities to extinguish fires burning near Alma ash-Shaab as a result of the exchange of fire along the Blue Line. These fires, which resulted from the exchange of fire, are occurring in mine fields — which as one can easily imagine are very, very difficult fires to put out. **Central African Republic Back here, in the Security Council this morning, the Security Councilheard a briefing from Valentine Rugwabiza, the Head of our peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic — MINUSCA. She said the Mission has continued its work to optimize its efficiency to protect civilians, provide security for humanitarian assistance, support local conflict mediation and reconciliation and facilitate the decentralization and implementation of the political peace process. Also, she noted that the period that just ended was dominated by persistent challenges, aggravated by an increase in humanitarian needs due to influx of refugees from Chad and Sudan. The SRSG (Special Representative of the Secretary-General) reiterated that the implementation of the peace agreement remains key for a return to peace and sustainable development in the Central African Republic and called for renewed attention to an inclusive dialogue with political opposition and armed groups. **Sudan Turning to Sudan, the Humanitarian Coordinator there, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, says she is deeply concerned by continued reports of attacks against civilian infrastructure, noting that ""even hospital wards full of sick and wounded children are not safe"" from conflict. Since the start of the war in April, the World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 58 attacks on health care, and as a reminder, more than 70 per cent of health facilities in conflict areas in Sudan are now out of service. Seventy per cent. Over the weekend, the water supply in Omdurman in the State of Khartoum was temporarily suspended after a water treatment centre came under fire. Our colleagues on the ground say that this is extremely worrying, given the ongoing cholera outbreak in Khartoum State and other parts of the country. More than 1,600 suspected cholera cases — including about 67 deaths — have been reported in Sudan, and we and our partners are scaling up our response to the outbreak. And it goes without saying that, also in Sudan, international humanitarian law must be respected, and civilians must be protected. **Ukraine Turning to Ukraine: The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) today published a Rapid Environmental Assessment of the Kakhovka Dam Breach. The report notes that the breach of the Kakhovka dam in June of this year is a far-reaching environmental disaster that goes beyond Ukraine's borders; the magnitude of which might not be clear for years or even decades to come. According to the assessment, while the flooding downstream caused considerable environmental loss and damage, the situation upstream of the dam is even more significant. The report points out that the events led to the release of chemical pollutants, including machine oil and liquid fertilizer, as a significant number of sites storing chemicals were located in the flood zone. This could negatively impact fauna and flora, as well as residents, in the affected area. More information in the interweb. **Venezuela I was asked by one of your colleagues about the situation in Venezuela, and I can say that the Secretary-General is closely following developments in Venezuela. He calls on the authorities to guarantee full adherence and respect for the political and electoral rights of its citizens. And he reiterates his call to implement in good faith the partial agreement on the promotion of political rights and electoral guarantees for all, that was signed in Barbados just a few days ago on 17 October. Before we go to the SG, if you have some questions, I will do my best in an effort to answer them. **Questions and Answers Spokesman: Madame? Question: Me? Spokesman: Well… Question: Am I the only one? Okay. Spokesman: Yeah. You are a Madame. Yeah. Question: My question is, you said that the UN is currently using existing reserves of fuel in Gaza. And you also said that the 62 trucks, the resources in the trucks have managed to reach hospitals. Am I correct in saying that it was the fuel within your reserves that helped to transport those? Spokesman: Yes. Exactly. Question: Okay. Then my next follow-up question is, you said that the reserves are going to be exhausted soon. Do you know how much fuel you have left? Spokesman: I don't have an exact number of gallons. What I can tell you is that our colleagues at UNRWA have been rationing and restricting the fuel supplies to try to kind of squeeze the last drop. So, it's hard to give you an end date, but we're talking very short amount of time. Question: So, UNRWA tweeted earlier that… they tweeted about 20 hours ago that tonight, they may have to halt all the operations due to fuel. Do you know is there a clock? Do you know… [cross talk] Spokesman: No. I mean, they're really literally trying to… I mean, it's as if you're trying to squeeze a lemon and trying to squeeze every last drop. Correspondent: Okay. Thank you. Spokesman: Okay. Yes, Ephrem. Correspondent: Well, I'm number 2 today in this area. Thanks, Stephane. Spokesman: Sorry? Correspondent: I said I'm number 2 today. This has never happened. Spokesman: Well, because you sit in the back. Ephrem, if you sat in the front, people would call… it's a matter of positioning. Nothing else matters in my eyesight. Today, Switzerland announced that it's cutting funding for more than 10 Israeli and Palestinian organizations who are prominent in advocacy of international humanitarian law. Many prominent advocates in the world have said that any attempt to connect these organizations to terrorism is — I'm not going to use the word — but is not credible. Do you have any comment on this move? Spokesman: No, I mean, I'll take a look. I was not aware of the report. Jordan, and then I'll come back to the room. Question: Today during the General Assembly session on Palestine, the Iranian Foreign Minister stated that he's willing to do, like, he's going to, like, try to release the hostages. With Qatar, they will be going to Iran. And then he also mentioned that has to be also in relation and taken into consideration that there are 6,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. What is your position on that? Spokesman: Look, our position is that the hostages need to be released unconditionally. And unconditionally means without condition, full stop. And I think it's very important that all those Member States that have an opportunity to play a positive role, do so. Question: Steph, a follow-up. Do you also call for Israel to release the 1,200 Palestinians that were taken from West Bank in the last three weeks to Israeli jail? Would you call also to be released as the UN? Spokesman: We have repeatedly — and you could look at all the reports and statements have been issued — called for people who have been held in administrative detention to be either charged or released. Question: Unconditionally — can you use the same term? Spokesman: I've answered your question on both these issues. I see somebody waving their hand. I think it's Caitlin, but I know… Correspondent: It's Caitlin. Spokesman: Oh, it is Caitlin. I'm sorry. You're sitting even further away than the others so… Correspondent: That's deliberate. Question: Stéphane, I just wanted to clarify. Sorry if you mentioned this earlier, but you were speaking very fast. How many trucks have crossed into Gaza today through Rafah? Spokesman: Sorry. Today, what I said, and I apologize for speaking too quickly, 62 trucks travelled through the Rafah crossing from Saturday to Tuesday. Given the complexity of the situation on the ground, we have a bit of an information lag about the numbers that may have happened either yesterday or today. So as soon as we have information to share, we have, in terms of the information we have here in New York, that's what I have. But do you have an understanding that there was aid that crossed since Tuesday? Spokesman: I'm trying to get more detail to sharpen my understanding. Spokesman: Thank you. Question: Again, Steph, on Gaza, do you have any comments on reports that Israel is refusing visas to UN officials? Spokesman: I mean, we've said today, we're continuing to engage through the normal channels with Israeli officials in order to get the visas that are needed for UN staff. Question: Can I ask a clarification? If UN staff are on diplomatic passports, do they still need visas? Spokesman: That is a great misunderstanding about what a diplomatic passport is. First of all, UN staff have what we call LPs, laissez-passers. It requires visa. I mean, when you travel on a UN ID, in most countries, you need a visa. It doesn't give you and we don't… in general terms, the UN cannot go into a place without the consent of the Government. So, it's not like an ID you wave through; if only. Dezhi? Question: So, two questions. First one is on Middle East. Today, nine Arab countries' foreign ministers released a joint statement. In that statement, they said that the right to self-defend, which is prescribed by the UN Charter, cannot be an excuse to violate international law and international humanitarian law. Does the Secretary-General agree on that? Spokesman: I mean, I would refer you to the very, I think, clear words that the Secretary-General delivered in the Security Council, two days ago and again, yesterday. Member States have their opinion and the Secretary-General's opinion was laid out in those remarks. Question: And total irrelevant question. Spokesman: You don't need to ask an irrelevant question. Question: The Russian Duma… because nobody is asking this. The Russian Duma actually passed a law to de-ratify the CTBT, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Do you have any comments on that? Spokesman: Well, I mean, that's not an irrelevant question, where obviously we've seen what's happened in the Duma, and I think we've been expressing very clearly our concern about the wrong… I'd say the wrong direction issues related to nuclear disarmament have been taken globally. We will be back here in seven minutes.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'egypt', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'algeria', 'not found', 'not found', 'not found', 'canada', 'chad', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'venezuela', 'venezuela', 'venezuela', 'barbados', 'switzerland', 'qatar', 'iran']",us,True,False

Listen to the full interview. As Colorado Public Radio's Miguel Otárola explains: Back in 2020, during one of Colorado's worst wildfire years in recorded history, firefighters asked Elizabeth Velasco if her small translation agency could help translate emergency alerts into Spanish. She jumped at the opportunity,translating dozens of press releasesand signing a contract to translate for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Velasco, 35, is now a certified wildland firefighter and has served as a public information officer for megafires in California and Oregon. Her why:""The more barriers that we can remove for people to engage,"" Velasco told CPR, ""that's going to just make us stronger."" In 2021, Colorado decided it wantedto address and prevent the disproportionate impacts of pollution and climate changeon low-income, Black, Latino and Indigenous people. Last year, Velasco was elected to represent Glenwood Springs, Colo., in the state House. Velasco told CPR that to her, ""environmental justice means not leaving anyone behind. It means letting community lead, listening to all the stakeholders and making sure we have clean air and clean water.""

Soil scientist at Oregon State University (and bassist in the '80s rock band Information Society). AsOPB's Michael Bendixen reports, rock stardom to soil science seems like a circuitous path, but Cassidy says the magic is all about the soil. The Earth is losing topsoil at an alarming rate, which is a big problem. ""Every molecule in your body has been through the soil billions of times, and the fact that you're not soil at this moment is a temporary condition,"" he says. ""It's all about the soil."" Cassidy encourages people to think of soil not as a thing but as an active process; not as a noun, but as a verb. A post shared by James Cassidy (@jamescassidy57) On his why:""When we lose agriculture, we don't have anything to eat,"" Cassidy says. ""All culture comes from agriculture. All civilizations come from agriculture. We will eventually return to the soil."" And organic matter is key: The more organic matter in the system, the more it creates an environment for the soil to have even more. It's exponential. ""When you increase organics by 1%, you can store 25,000 gallons more water per acre in that soil,"" Cassidy says. ""No matter who I meet or what their worldview is, no matter how divided we are, it's really our common ground: We all need soil to survive,"" he says. Loading... Archaeologist and manager, Garden of the Gods Park, Colorado Springs, Colo. LISTEN: Born and raised in Colorado Springs, Anna Cordova says her Indigenous background and archaeology experience are central to herstewardship of the city's most popular park. KRCC's Jess Hazel spoke to Cordova about the meaning of stewardship now and for future generations: ""I always joke that Garden of the Gods Park does not need a manager. The park itself doesn't need a manager. The people that come to the park do. And so just trying to figure out how to balance the resources with visitation and making sure that people can come here and enjoy it and fall in love with it just as much as so many millions of people have already done and how citizens of Colorado Springs have already done."" On her journey to this work:""I went into archaeology, even as an 18-year-old student, with the idea that Indigenous voices needed to be heard more and that it was a very colonial kind of practice. ... I remember there weren't a whole lot of Indigenous voices represented in archaeology. At least not published and things like that. I think it's very empowering, too, to be able to interpret your own history and not have other people do it for you. Archaeology also lends to how we manage and steward places now. That tribal consultation is not just about archaeology, it's about how we go forward into the future and how we do things in the present. So it's all connected and all extremely important to me."" A meteorologist for 18 years who got threats for his climate coverage and decided to pivot his career to finding solutions. Chris Gloninger, pictured in June 2022.Chris Gloningerhide caption Chris Gloninger, pictured in June 2022. TV meteorologist Chris Gloninger didn't just want to warn people about the latest record-breaking storm — he wanted to talk about the changing climate amplifying it: ""I truly believe it is the existential crisis of our lifetime, and that's why I think it's so important to do it."" On his why:Gloninger believes it's the job of meteorologists to keep people safe, and that interrupting regularly scheduled programming with a breaking weather alert is just one way they can do that. ""Climate change isn't an opinion, it's fact-based science. But at the same point, if your ideas differ from somebody else's, just be kind. Don't go on the offensive and attack,"" he says. ""We can live life with more love, kindness and compassion ... and we can all become better in that."" Gloninger — the chief meteorologist for CBS affiliate KCCI-TV in Des Moines, Iowa — has brought that mindset to seven television stations across five states during his 18-year career, earning him both praise and pushback. Earlier this year, he announced he was ""bidding farewell to TV to embark on a new journey dedicated to helping solve the climate crisis."" The reasons, he said, were ""a death threat stemming from my climate coverage last year and resulting PTSD, in addition to family health issues."" ""I'm not giving up,"" he told NPR's Rachel Treisman. ""I'm just switching roles to do even more of it."" Gloninger's quick to give credit to retired South Carolinameteorologist Jim Gandy, who he says ""got the ball rolling"" by launching theClimate Matters programin 2010. Chairwoman of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council who campaigned for sacred sites along California's coast to be a marine sanctuary. What could soon be the largest national marine sanctuary in the continental U.S. is the result of a campaign that started in 2015, when Walker's father nominated the area. The central California coast, with its rugged beaches and kelp forests, draws a lot of visitors for its scenic beauty. For the Chumash people, the coastline means a lot more. ""Almost all the places people like to go to are our sacred sites,""Walker told NPR's Lauren Sommer. ""We've been going there and praying and doing ceremony there for 20,000 years."" Walker says restoring their connection to the coast is a big part of bringing back Chumash culture. When a liquified natural gas terminal was proposed for Point Conception, an angular piece of land that juts into the Pacific, tribal members occupied the site to protest the project. ""We believe when all people exit this world, they exit at Point Conception,"" Walker says. ""Protecting that site is a spiritual connection for us. The same as any other religion protects their icons, their religious symbols, that's ours."" Establishing theChumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuarywould also mean the waters are largely protected from development, like oil rigs and wind turbines.

We can't put them against each other. And unless people know that — unless people know how bad the situation actually is — they're not going to demand change because they're going to want to keep things the way they are."" On if it ever gets overwhelming:""Maybe yes, overwhelming. But I think what's more is the feeling of doing something that matters. Doing something that has an impact. Something that in the future, I will be able to look back at and say I did what I could during this existential crisis when most people were just either looking away or were too busy with their own lives.""

Two dams in the Libyan city of Derna experienced catastrophic failures on the night of September 10-11 as a result of Storm Daniel. The deluge wiped out entire residential areas, and the Red Crescent has estimated that at least 11,000 people died and an additional 10,000 are still missing as a result of the disaster. Speaking to RT on Tuesday, hydrologist Ashoor suggested that the damage wrought by NATO’s intervention in the North African country in 2011 was a factor in the tragedy. “In the early days of the revolution in Libya, everyone celebrated the NATO intervention as people rose against the Gaddafi regime and demanded his removal. However, later we discovered that the country was engulfed by chaos,” Ashoor said.“After this intervention, they [NATO] were unable to bring the country to a state of stability.” The expert believes that weak leadership, in addition to financial corruption – especially regarding funds allocated for dam repairs – led to the collapses. According to Ashoor,“there is lack of maintenance”in Libya and there have been “numerous reports in the past warning about [this].” “The poor condition of these dams, coupled with the possibility of major floods, could inevitably lead to a collapse of the dams. All these assessments, along with evaluations conducted by previous companies and experts, indicated that such a disaster would occur,”Ashoor added. Following the disaster, rescue teams and aid were sent by neighboring Egypt, Algeria, and Tunisia, as well as Türkiye, Italy, Malta, the United Arab Emirates, Germany, and the UK. The Russian Emergencies Ministry (EMERCOM) has deployed specialist teams to assist with search and rescue efforts.","['libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'egypt', 'algeria', 'tunisia', 'turkey', 'italy', 'malta', 'unitedstates', 'germany', 'uk']",ru,False,False

Koinu comes just a month after Hong Kong was lashed by Typhoon Saola, which triggered its highest ""T10"" storm alert. A week after that, the city experienced its highest rainfall in nearly 140 years, flooding subway stations and malls, and causing landslides. Typhoon Koinu was at the third-highest alert in Hong Kong's warning system for most of the day. It was upgraded to ""T9"" for more than four hours -- when the typhoon was closest to the city -- before the observatory dropped it back down to ""T8"" at 11:50 pm local time (1550 GMT). ""In the past couple of hours, Koinu tracked westwards steadily. The associated hurricane force winds are gradually departing from the seas south of Hong Kong,"" said the observatory, issuing a map that showed Koinu's path headed directly for China's island province of Hainan. It was about 70 kilometres (43 miles) south-southwest of Hong Kong around midnight and was forecast to edge closer to the western part of the Pearl River Estuary. Despite the storm downgrade to ""T8"" -- which will be in place until 11 am Monday -- the observatory warned the public ""precautions should not yet be relaxed"", and said the gales generated by Koinu were expected to persist. The ""T8"" warning level is triggered when a storm's maximum sustained wind speed reaches 117 kilometres (72 miles) per hour. Koinu's were observed at 145 kilometres (90 miles) per hour. Around 90 flights were cancelled Sunday and 130 others delayed throughout the day due to the storm, according to Hong Kong's Airport Authority. Daycare centres, cargo terminals, ferries and buses suspended operations Sunday, while schools -- also closed -- will remain shuttered Monday. Hong Kong's government received reports of more than 20 people wounded during the typhoon Sunday, as well as more than a dozen incidents of fallen trees due to strong winds. In China's Guangdong province -- where Koinu is expected to sweep past en route to Hainan -- the cities of Zhuhai and Jiangmen issued a Level III emergency response, according to Xinhua news agency Sunday. That meant more than 35,500 fishing boats had to return to port, while dozens of coastal scenic areas were temporarily closed. Before moving to Hong Kong, Koinu had grazed nearby Taiwan, bringing torrential rain and record-breaking winds to its outlying Orchid Island. The storm left at least one dead, and knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of homes.

Koinu -- which caused one death in Taiwan last week -- had weakened into a severe tropical storm by Monday, said the Hong Kong Observatory, as it moved toward the coastal areas of China's Guangdong province. The storm caused non-stop rain overnight, leading the agency to issue a ""black"" rainstorm warning signal -- its highest -- for about six hours before it was downgraded at 10:30 am (0230 GMT). More than 150 millimetres of rain were recorded over most parts of the territory since midnight Monday, and rainfall exceeded 300 millimetres over some parts of urban Hong Kong island, data showed. ""Heavy rain will bring flash floods... People should stay away from watercourses,"" the observatory said, adding that residents living near rivers be alert in case they need to evacuate. The city's third-highest storm warning signal -- ""T8"" -- was to remain in place until 11:40 am local time. Due to the storm warning, trading at the city's stock exchange was suspended in the morning session, but was expected to resume at 2:00 pm. Schools and daycare centres, ordered to shut when authorities issued the T8 signal a day earlier, remained closed Monday. This was the second time in a month the city has issued the black rain warning. In early September, Hong Kong experienced its highest rainfall in nearly 140 years, flooding subway stations and malls, and causing landslides. While no major damage was initially reported, the hoisting of the second-highest typhoon warning on Sunday evening caused issues at Hong Kong's international airport, where hundreds of arriving passengers were stranded without bus, subway or taxi services. ""A large number of arriving passengers had to wait for a relatively long time because the AirPort Express -- a main transport link between the airport and the city -- was suspended due to safety reasons,"" said an airport representative Monday.

The man was taken away and the area cordoned off by police, according to the City of Chaos Facebook page, which posted a video clip of the incident, while the authorities deployed around 7,000 police officers across the city, with the anti-terrorism squad and armored cars patrolling the busy pedestrian areas around Causeway Bay. A Hong Kong protester in London who gave only the nickname Mavis for fear of reprisals said many people in Britain aren't aware of the differences between her home city and China, which has rolled back the city's promised freedoms in response to waves of popular pro-democracy movements, blaming interference by ""hostile foreign forces."" 'We have responsibilities' A Hong Konger surnamed Ng said he goes to every Hong Kong protest, because he feels he has a responsibility. ""There are Hong Kong people wherever you go, and certain things need to be done,"" Ng said. ""As regular citizens, we have responsibilities."" ""If you care about a place, you will naturally want to do something to help it, and we still identify as Hong Kongers,"" he said. ""Even here in the U.K., we will always feel like we will one day go back there."" A protester who gave only the initial J said he hails from the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, but feels he has more in common with Hong Kongers than with Chinese Communist Party propaganda. ""After I got to the U.K., I decided to connect with some of my brothers from Hong Kong, because we have a common enemy in the Chinese Communist Party,"" J said. ""They don't just deprive Hong Kongers of their freedoms, they harm the rest of the country, too."" Tokyo march Similar protests were seen over the weekend in several British cities, while dozens of Uyghurs, Tibetans, Mongolians and Hong Kongers rallied outside the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo after marching through the downtown hub of Shibuya. ""We are strongly dissatisfied with the oppression of the Chinese Communist Party of the Chinese people and of all ethnic groups,"" a speaker said at the start of the march. ""We want to make our voices heard today!"" ""Give Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Hong Kong their freedom back!"" chanted the protesters, who numbered nearly 100. When the marchers arrived at the Chinese Embassy, Japanese police prevented more than five demonstrators from gathering outside at any time, sending them in to make their protests in groups by turn. Sawut Muhammad, director of the Japan Uyghur Association, said Oct. 1 is a day of ""national mourning"" for Uyghurs, because their home country of East Turkestan was subsumed by the People's Republic of China on that day. ""Some people have raised the issue of Uyghur forced labor,"" he said. ""Such products are also exported to Japan, and some products from Xinjiang can also be seen on sale in Japan."" ""So at this time, we would like to strongly appeal to democratic countries, including Japan, to pay attention to the Uyghur issue, and even more attention to the issue of Uyghur forced labor,"" he said. A protester from the southern province of Guangzhou who gave only the surname Chen said he had emigrated to Japan in recent years due to ever-widening authoritarian rule in China. ""China is becoming more and more authoritarian,"" he said. ""If you say something online that the government doesn't want to hear, your account will be blocked and some netizens will report you."" 'We have to stand up' On the democratic island of Taiwan, Hong Kongers braved heavy rain to warn people of Beijing's attempts at influence and infiltration. ""Freedom and democracy collapsed in Hong Kong due to the infiltration of the Chinese Communist Party,"" Taiwan-based activist Fu Tong told Radio Free Asia. ""We don't want other democratic countries to wind up like Hong Kong, so we have to stand up and tell everyone about our experience."" ""Democratic freedoms are easily harmed, and need protecting,"" he said. A Hong Konger who emigrated to Taiwan who gave only the initial A for fear of reprisals said Oct. 1 used to be a happy occasion for him, but since the 2019 protests and ensuing crackdown, he is reminded of how the city has changed. ""A lot of Hong Kongers turned out, despite the heavy rain,"" A said. ""Some didn't show their faces, but stood at the back, keeping a low profile."" Some protesters flew banners emblazoned with a slogan now banned back home, ""Free Hong Kong, Revolution Now!"" while others brought along the yellow umbrellas symbolizing the pro-democracy movement. Sky Fung, secretary-general of the Taiwan-based exile group Hong Kong Outlanders, said many more people were silent sympathizers. ""There were actually a lot of people all along the streets who silently took photos, [or who] showed their support,"" Fung said. ""It means we are still holding onto our beliefs, and we won't give up until the day we achieve our goals."" One participant who gave only the pseudonym Lam said she had flown in specially from Hong Kong. ""I was standing nearby to show support, because you can't do something like this in Hong Kong any more,"" she said. ""Only if you come here."" The rally ended with the singing of the banned protest anthem, ""Glory to Hong Kong."" Translated by Luisetta Mudie. Edited by Malcolm Foster. Copyright 1998-2023, RFA.

Matt BurgessandLily Hay Newman Grace Browne Tom Bennett Yet, amid all of the deceptive images and video moving around on social media, the content generated by artificial intelligence tools has remained relatively peripheral. Even as some wondered if the Israel-Hamas war would be the first conflict dominated by false generative AI images, the technology has had a more complex and subtle impact. “There are definitely AI images circulating but not to the degree where I think it’s playing a central role in the spread of information,” says Layla Mashkoor, an associate editor at the Atlantic Council’sDigital Forensic Research Lab, which studies online disinformation. Primarily, Mashkoor says, AI-generated disinformation is being used by activists to solicit support—or give the impression of wider support—for a particular side. Examples include an AI-generated billboard inTel Avivchampioning Israel Defense Forces, an Israeli accountsharingfake images of people cheering for the IDF, an Israeli influencerusingAI to generate condemnations of Hamas, andAI imagesportrayingvictims of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. “In terms of general use that I’ve been seeing online, it’s mostly been to drum up support, which is not among the most malicious ways to utilize AI right now,” she says. A key factor here is the sheer amount of misinformation circulating, which makes it difficult for AI images to shape conversation. “The information space is already being flooded with real and authentic images and footage,” says Mashkoor, “and that in itself is flooding the social media platforms.” This point is reflected ina recent paperfrom theHarvard Kennedy School Misinformation Reviewabout the role generative AI might play in the spread of false info worldwide. In it, the authors write that concerns about the effects of the technology are “overblown.” While, yes, gen AI theoretically lets people proliferate misinformation at a futuristic rate, those who seek out this misinformation—often those who have “low trust in institutions … [or are] strong partisans”—already have a surfeit of familiar nonsense to pursue, from conspiracy theory websites to 4chan forums.

A new survey finds most Americans expect the impacts of climate change to worsen in the next 30 years, as climate scientists warn.Claire Harbage/NPRhide caption Two women embrace and cry as they look out over a burned area in Lahaina, Hawaii in August 2023. A new survey finds most Americans expect the impacts of climate change to worsen in the next 30 years, as climate scientists warn. Most Americans say that climate change is harming people in the United States, and that climate impacts will get worse over their lifetime, according to a new national survey by the Pew Research Center. Nearly 3 in 4 people said that climate change is hurting people in the U.S. today,according to the surveyof nearly 9,000 adults. Indeed, this year has seen arecord-breaking numberof weather disasters that caused at least $1 billion in damage each, including the catastrophicwildfires in Maui, ahurricane in Floridaand multipledeadly floods. This is the first time the Pew Research Center, which conducts national surveys on a range of salient topics in American life, has included such detailed questions about how Americans feel about the current and future impacts of climate change. Most of those surveyed say they expect climate-driven disasters to intensify in the future. ""The majority of Americans see some fairly severe environmental harms as likely to happen over the next 30 years,"" says Alec Tyson of the Pew Research Center, who helped lead the survey. ""For example, 73% say they think a growing number of plant and animal species will go extinct, 61% say they think heat waves will cause large numbers of people to die in the U.S. every year and 58% think rising sea levels will force large numbers of people in the U.S. to move away from the coast."" Those sentiments are backed up by scientific research, which haslong warnedthat greenhouse gas emissionswould threaten Americans'health, finances and very lives. Reducing fossil fuel consumption dramatically and immediately will help avoid even more dangerous warming in the future. Most Americans expect renewable energy to get more ubiquitous in the coming years, the survey finds, with 57% saying that they expect renewable energy will produce most of the energy in the U.S. in 30 years. In 2022, renewable energy, including wind and solar, accounted for a little less than a quarter of American electricity generation, but investment in renewable energyis accelerating. One thing the survey suggests is that there is tension between Americans' perception that climate change impacts are getting worse, and their understanding of how those impacts might occur in their own communities. Although most respondents say climate change impacts will be more severe in the next 30 years, only 41% think climate change will make their own community a worse place to live over that same time period. And just as many say they don't think climate change will make much difference in their community. Flooding in Bridgewater, Vt., in July 2023 submerged vehicles and flooded buildings. Americans are sad, anxious and often motivated to act about climate change according to a new survey.Hasan Jamali/APhide caption Flooding in Bridgewater, Vt., in July 2023 submerged vehicles and flooded buildings. Americans are sad, anxious and often motivated to act about climate change according to a new survey. That dissonance also shows up in another finding from the survey: the majority of Americans say the Southwest, coastal Florida and Southern California are going to become worse areas to live over the next 30 years because of climate change. Yet those regions include some of thefastest-growing placesin the country. Younger people are more concerned about climate change, and are more likely to be calling on those in power to act, the survey finds. ""Young adults are especially likely to think harm will increase in the United States. Nearly 8 and 10 say that, over the course of their lifetime,"" says Tyson. Young people are also more likely to say that their community will be a worse place to live over the next 30 years because of climate change, the survey finds. That concern may spur young people to donate money to climate-related causes, contact elected officials about climate legislation or attend a climate rally, the survey suggests. Nearly one third of people 18 to 29 years old say they've participated in climate activism in the last year, which is nearly twice the rate of people 65 and older. The survey asked people about the feelings they have when they read news stories about climate change or encounter climate advocacy in their lives. ""One of the most widely held sentiments is feeling sad about what's happening to the Earth,"" says Tyson. Nearly three quarters of Americans say they feel sad. Anxiety about the impacts of climate change is also a major sentiment, as well as frustration about the lack of political agreement on the topic. Half of those surveyed say they feel motivated to address climate change. Some Americans are also skeptical of those who are advocating for policies that would address climate change, such as investment in renewable energy, the survey finds. ""53% of Americans, and this is particularly widespread among Republicans, say they felt suspicious of the groups and people pushing for action on climate change,"" says Tyson.

But when you’ve come all the way to India to experience the monsoon, all you want is rain. On my first visit to India 23 years ago, I stayed at an Ayurvedic spa in the Himalayas. One of the things that the Ayurvedic doctor told me was that going to a spa is better during the annual monsoon. Something about the heavy rains helps calm the soul and allows the body to be most receptive to the benefits of treatments. I added it to my bucket list. Finally, the time had come to experience India during the monsoon. My destination: Six Senses Vana, a wellness retreat set in the foothills of the Himalayas. My motivation: to take my mom on a mother-daughter trip of a lifetime to celebrate her 80th birthday. It was a remarkable milestone that held even more significance considering the recent passing of my father. In the wake of my dad’s death, my mother channeled her grief into a mission of transformation, focusing on improving her overall health and well-being. So bringing her on a bucket-list wellness journey seemed like the perfect way to celebrate 80 years on earth and help set her up for many more years fueled by health and well-being. On a monsoon trip to Six Senses Vana, a wellness retreat in the foothills of the Himalayas. We chose Six Senses Vana because the program has an array of activities designed to engage all the senses: yoga, meditation, fitness, sound therapy, wellness talks, the list goes on. I had heard from friends that it was truly transformative but not too radical for an 80-year-old. Included in the rate is a daily spa treatment that taps into healing modalities from around the world—from Ayurveda to Tibetan medicine to acupuncture—as well as healthy cuisine and clothing to wear during your stay. Plus, it’s not far from Rishikesh, which is one of the world’s holiest cities as well as the birthplace of yoga. Getting here was quite an odyssey: We took connecting flights from New York through London to Delhi, then had a five-hour drive to Dehradun, where the property is located. We could have saved time if we had flown directly to Delhi and taken a connecting flight to the Rishikesh airport, but the flights through London were considerably cheaper (and an Indian friend of mine also advised that doing the connecting flight would help break up the long trip). I loved the drive—we were able to see the vastness of the Indian countryside and passed through vibrant small towns along the way. Mother and daughter in the Kila, a shared central space. The moment we arrived at Six Senses Vana, I felt an immediate sense of tranquility. Named after the surrounding forest, Vana offers not just physical nourishment and holistic rejuvenation but also a spiritual connection to nature. Taking refuge in the forest is an important part of Indian culture, and for many years, Vana had been a privately owned sanctuary for rebalancing and healing. In January 2023, the pioneering global wellness brand Six Senses took over the management, infusing their expertise into every aspect of the retreat. The staff’s warm approach made us feel instantly at home. They explained the philosophy and the rules (no cellphones in any public spaces, for instance). We were given a blessing and presented with a wooden bracelet made from sandalwood, which is believed to bring emotional balance. The modern design of Six Senses Vana. In our room, we changed into loose-fitting white kurta pajamas that the property provides, along with an optional light-colored shawl and a sustainably produced linen tote. Every guest wears this outfit throughout the stay, and while I initially felt a bit awkward (I’m a New Yorker who always wears black), there was something calming about seeing all the other guests wearing the same clothing. It puts everyone on a level playing field and helps shift the focus inward. I was also surprised by how much I appreciated not having to decide what to wear every day. Immediately, we were whisked off to the wellness center, where I had a Tibetan “ku nye” massage that uses an ancient blend of therapeutic oils. The aim: to reduce mental stress and ease lethargy. My mother had a Swedish massage that is said to improve circulation and soothe the nervous system. They were deeply relaxing—the perfect introduction to our journey. A Tibetan treatment with natural stones. At dinner that night at Salana restaurant, the dining team talked us through Vana’s approach to balanced eating. Meals are meticulously crafted to balance your doshas, but guests also have the freedom to choose—within limits. I wanted to order the chicken tikka with roasted pepper appetizer, followed by the stir-fried prawns with beans, carrots, bok choy and coriander. But this was discouraged: Mixing seafood and protein isn’t great for gut health. And while the property allows you to order wine, mom and I had decided to embrace healthy living and abstain. But the watermelon, mint and parsley juice? Cold drinks aren’t recommended in the evening. Instead, the staff suggested a glass of warm water to prepare for sleep. “Our cuisine is an extension of wellness and the basic objective is to create balance and nourishment,” Rajesh Sharma, the executive chef, told us. “The menus stay with the season. We use hyper-local ingredients. And we cook from scratch—we even make our own apple cider vinegar.” According to Sharma, it’s rare that you’ll ever sample the same dish twice. Sharma and his team have created a vast library of more than 1,738 dishes, with vegetarian, vegan and meat-based options. The cuisine is mostly centered around Indian flavors but there are also influences and options from around the world, from China to Italy. The cuisine at Salana restaurant. But back to the monsoon—one of the major reasons we were here. When we woke up the next day, I was expecting to see rain, heavy rain—but there was the sun, peeking through the clouds and casting a shadow of doubt on my dream of experiencing the monsoon. We started the day with wellness consultations and screenings with Ayurvedic doctors, who mapped out each of our individual plans, combining detox, sleep, weight management and more, all customized to our needs. During lunch at Anayu, the thali restaurant, we enjoyed a tasting meal tailored to our doshas. And then, the sky began to change. Dark clouds gathered, and the first raindrop hit the ground, followed by another and another. The monsoon had arrived, and as we stepped outside, the rain felt like a gentle embrace, almost as if nature herself was welcoming us. A yoga session. As the monsoon showers continued over the next few days, so did our transformational journey. Reflexology guided by a master practitioner left us feeling grounded and balanced. Sound therapy led by skilled musicians with bells and flutes transported us to a state of deep relaxation. The private spa treatments—from an Ayurvedic massage done with two masseuses to a facial infused with 24-karat gold—pampered us in ways we hadn’t imagined. Every yoga session, meditation hour and cooking lesson felt like stepping stones toward renewal. As my mother and I participated in the retreat’s activities together, I could feel our spirits rekindling, our skin literally glowing with newfound vitality. On top of that, the raindrops from the monsoon seemed to cleanse not only the earth but also our souls, washing away the weight of grief and loss. “The monsoon season at Six Senses Vana is a time of profound transformation—when your body is more receptive. It’s a time to clear out the old and bring in the new,” Dr. Jitendra Varshney, the wellness director, told me. He explained that during this season, herbs penetrate the body in a deeper way, purification improves and it’s more detoxifying. “You can achieve any health goal and feel more balanced.” The outdoor pool (beautiful even during the monsoon rains). We met other guests, each with their own unique stories. There was Preeti, a 60-year-old Indian woman from Delhi, who had embarked on her own journey of self-discovery—her first-ever solo trip. She shared how the monsoon was a time of personal renewal and how she had come here to find herself. A father and son duo from Italy were back for their second trip to Six Senses Vana, and they spoke about the retreat as a place where generational bonds strengthened amid the monsoon’s healing embrace. “It’s good for the body—and the mind,” the dad told me. A group of young women from Uzbekistan on a girlfriend getaway found solace in the shared experience of rejuvenation and self-care. They laughed (quietly), they meditated and they found a deeper connection with one another as they navigated their individual wellness journeys. An Australian woman who lives in London was here to mend after the end of a long relationship. It was part of a bigger Eat, Pray, Love-style expedition; before coming to Vana, she had been in Bali. Relaxing in the Bodhi Tree space space during Raag Therapy, a music-based relaxation session. Six Senses Vana’s commitment to sustainability is also woven throughout the experience. This was the first retreat in India to be LEEDS certified back in 2015. On sustainability tours, guests can explore the property’s green initiatives, from water-saving technologies to waste reduction practices. Vana has planted more than 10,000 trees in the area. There are also upcycling workshops where guests can make paper out of recycled materials, for instance. It was inspiring to witness a wellness retreat so committed to preserving the natural beauty that surrounds it. “If you take care of nature, nature will take care of you,” explained Dr. Varshney. The Forest Suite, one of the guest rooms, at Six Senses Vana. Another highlight was visiting Rishikesh, where we had a puja (a blessing) with a Hindu priest along the shores of the sacred Ganges river. We lit candles and prayed and made offerings to the river and asked for a blessing over my mother in honor of her 80th birthday and the soul of my father. It was deeply moving. Later, we watched the nightly Aarti, a fire offering to the river that’s held at sunset. As monks from the local temple held up elaborate flaming candelabras and the crowd sang devotional songs, the rain came down in heavy sheets. We were soaked to the bone, but we didn’t mind at all—it was a beautiful experience. A blessing with a Hindu priest alongside the Ganges river in Rishikesh. When it came time to leave Six Senses Vana, the staff said their goodbyes and tied a red string around each of our wrists to symbolize long life. I reflected on the journey we had shared. The monsoon had done its magic, but the retreat had been the catalyst for something even more profound—a reconnection of body and spirit, a bond between a mother and daughter and a celebration of life’s precious moments. As we left the retreat, I knew that this experience would forever hold a special place in our hearts, a reminder of transformation and strength and the enduring power of love.

A cryptominer that never seemed to generate very much cryptocurrency for its creators is part of a larger digital espionage campaign, according to researchers from security firm Kaspersky Lab. The platform, which they call StripedFly, has infected more than 1 million Windows and Linux targets globally since 2017. StripedFly is modular and has multiple components for compromising targets' devices and collecting different types of data, indicating that it was likely created as part of a well-funded state espionage program, not a cybercriminal enterprise. It also includes an update mechanism so attackers can distribute improvements and new functionality to the malware. StripedFly can, among other things, steal access credentials from compromised devices; take screenshots; grab databases, sensitive files, videos, or other information of interest; and record live audio by compromising a target's microphone. Notably, StripedFly uses an innovative, custom Tor client to mask communication and exfiltration between the malware and its command-and-control servers. It also has a ransomware component that attackers have occasionally deployed. It infects targets initially using a customized version of thenotorious EternalBlue exploitleaked from the US National Security Agency.

One of the documents shows a GOST catchphrase, “We see the people behind the data,” and a user guide from the documents says GOST is “capable of providing behavioral-based internet search capabilities.” ICE agents can search the system for specific names, addresses, email addresses, and countries of citizenship. The documents say that “potentially derogatory social media can be reviewed within the interface.” The world’s telephony networks have often been built on legacy infrastructure and with a convoluted maze of interconnections. The system enables mobile data access across much of the world, but its complexity and the collision of new and archaic technologies can lead to vulnerabilities. This week, University of Toronto’s Citizen Labpublishedextensive research on the degree to which roaming arrangements between mobile providers contain security issues that can be exploited to track devices, and by extension the people who own them. The flaw comes from a lack of protection on the communications between cell towers as you, for instance, travel on a train, ride a motorcycle, or walk around town. The concern is that governments, criminals, or other snoops can manipulate the weaknesses in these handoff communications to track device locations. “These vulnerabilities are most often tied to the signaling messages that are sent between telecommunications networks which expose the phones to different modes of location disclosure,” Citizen Lab researchers wrote.","['not found', 'israel', 'palestinianterritories', 'unitedstates', 'russia', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'netherlands']",us,True,False

Canadian farmers are looking for ways to deal with recurrent drought, including planting earlier and using seeds that are more resistant to heat. The cost of climate change is growing for companies as extreme weatherdisrupts manufacturing and supply chainsand inflicts billions in economic losses. For the agriculture industry, the threat from rising temperatures ""may be one of the greatest that we face in this lifetime,""according to Corteva, an Indiana company that makes seeds and chemicals. But Corteva — which was previously part of DowDuPont — says it has a plan. There's money to be made producing things like biofuels to powershipsandairplaneswith less climate pollution, and crops that are better atresisting diseasesas the planet gets hotter. And — crucially — Corteva says it is curbing some of its own emissions of the greenhouse gasses that are heating the planet. If it misses deadlines it set for operating more sustainably, the company says its relationships with customers and investors could suffer. However, that hasn't stopped Corteva from working alongside other American companies and lobbyists to limit upcomingregulations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that would make businesses disclosetheir emissions and the risks they face from climate change. Businesses and climate activists have been pushing to shape the SEC rules for months, because the stakes are high. The economy is awash in climate disclosures that companies tout, but there are few ways for customers and investors to gauge the validity of the claims. The SEC's goal is to ensure that publicly-traded corporations are reporting comparable information, and also to make sure they aren't misleading investors about their environmental activities — a practice known as greenwashing, Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, told the House Financial Services Committee in September. And while Gensler has said repeatedly that the SEC isn't writing climate regulations — they're rules for financial reporting — the requirements the agency comes up with could boost efforts to limit global warming. A study published this summer in the journalSciencefound that requiring companies to disclose their emissionscould put pressure on firms to cut their climate pollution. The SEC isn't alone. Regulators in theEuropean Union,United KingdomandHong Konghave been writing their own rules for what companies have to tell investors about climate change. And in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed a pair of bills that will force big companies operating in the state, including Corteva, to publicly disclose theirfinancial risks from global warmingandhow much greenhouse gas pollutioncomes from their operations and supply chains. Corteva, whichoperates a chemical plant in California, didn't respond to multiple messages seeking comment. ""The days of a company trying to avoid reporting their emissions at all are over,"" says Madison Condon, an associate professor at Boston University School of Law who studies climate change and financial risk. Yet even as companies in the United States begin adjusting to that new reality, groups on both sides of the regulatory fight are trying to influence the looming SEC rules. In part, that's because they think the agency's requirements could determine how regulations evolve globally. How the rules are written will dictate the kind of information that companies have to give to investors and could shape the ways that businesses respond to climate change. ""I think there are valid criticisms of the way the EU has rolled out their own disclosure requirements,"" Condon says. ""So, I think it would be great if the U.S. got out there and showed alternative ways of thinking about how these disclosures should be."" Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler testifies during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in September.Mariam Zuhaib/APhide caption Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler testifies during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in September. The fight to influence the SEC's climate rules is part of a larger battle over what kinds of information financial firms should be able to consider when they're making investment decisions. In Washington and in state houses around the country, Republican officials and political operatives have beenattacking investment firms that account for issues related to climate change, saying the practice is aimed at hurting the country's fossil fuel industry. ""Let's be honest, the agenda here is not to provide investors with relevant information, but instead to redirect capital away from fossil energy,"" Rep. Andy Barr, a Republican from Kentucky, said of the SEC's pending climate-disclosure rules at a Congressional hearing in September. The climate rules the SEC proposed in early 2022 are wide-ranging and attracted thousands of public comments. Publicly-traded companies would have to report on the threats they're facing from global warming: how extreme weather, which is being fueled by rising temperatures, is affecting their financial performance and influencing their business strategies. They would also have to say how executives and corporate boards manage those risks. Among the most significant aspects of the SEC rules is a requirement for companies to account for their greenhouse gas emissions, the pollution that's trapping heat close to the Earth and pushing up global temperatures. Under the SEC's proposals, there's an entire chain of production and activity whose pollution corporations would have to calculate. Some of those emissions are obvious. A company that makes shoes, for example, would have to say how much climate pollution is coming from its factories and corporate offices. But at the next layer, the shoemaker would also have to tally emissions that don't come directly from its operations. For example, how much climate pollution is created by the power plants that feed electricity to its factories? And on a third and most controversial level — something calledScope 3 emissions— what's the pollution from the businesses that make the rubber and leather that the shoemaker uses? And how much climate pollution is coming from the ships and trucks that deliver its shoes to customers? In a lot of cases, businesses are already giving investors some of that information, or versions of it. ""You have the majority of public companies getting together with their investors, determining what is material and disclosing it,"" says Tom Quaadman, executive vice president of the Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a lobbying group for American businesses. The word material refers to information thata reasonable investor would think is importantto know about a company. ""So, the appropriate disclosures for the marketplace are already happening,"" Quaadman says. Traffic makes its way through flood waters along the Brooklyn Queens Expressway in New York in September. Climate change makes heavy rain more common, because a hotter atmosphere can hold more moisture.Robert Bumsted/APhide caption Traffic makes its way through flood waters along the Brooklyn Queens Expressway in New York in September. Climate change makes heavy rain more common, because a hotter atmosphere can hold more moisture. But the climate disclosures that businesses like Corteva make vary widely, and they're scattered across company websites and in corporate reports. Experts who support stronger regulations say that investors and the public need standardized information to be able to compare the risks that different companies face from climate change, and to judge whether they're delivering on their emissions pledges. That includespromises from consumer goods businesses, like soda makers and cosmetic companies, to eliminate or offset all of their carbon-dioxide emissions. ""We certainly appreciate that there's been a lot of progress made by companies"" voluntarily reporting information about climate change, says Aron Szapiro, head of government affairs at Morningstar, a financial services company. ""But you don't have that kind of consistent, comparable, comprehensive disclosure right now. And that's where it's important to have a regulator lead."" Without direction and oversight from federal regulators, there's also concern that companies may be engaging in greenwashing. George Georgiev, an associate professor at Emory University School of Law, says some of the climate information that companies are releasing looks more like marketing material than risk disclosures. ""In fact, they're even being prepared by the marketing department versus the investor relations department,"" Georgiev says. ""So, they're painting a certain picture of the company being a green company or being up-to-date in terms of [a] transition to a carbon-neutral economy. And it sends a marketing message, as opposed to a more objective message about both the good and the bad, which is the purpose of the SEC disclosure regime."" California's disclosure laws, which are expected to apply to thousands of public and private companies, will probably have a similar effect. But experts and industry lobbyists say the SEC is in a unique position to influence how companies behave. The agency wields enforcement powers that can encourage companies to closely consider its rules and regulations. And information that companies file with the SEC will likely get more attention from investors and the public than disclosures they submit to California. The American Petroleum Institute (API), which represents the U.S. oil and gas industry, accepts that the SEC may need to require companies to disclose more information about their climate risks, says Aaron Padilla, the group's vice president of corporate policy. But he says the rules that the commission floated last year were too far-reaching. ""We share their objective of wanting to inform investors or present information that consumers and other stakeholders want and need,"" Padilla says. ""But it's a matter of being judicious to get that right."" The SEC is trying to decide whether public companies will have to disclose emissions that are linked indirectly to their businesses, including from their supply chains.BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The SEC is trying to decide whether public companies will have to disclose emissions that are linked indirectly to their businesses, including from their supply chains. In the coming months, the SEC is expected to announce what sort of climate information companies will have to disclose. Corporate lobbyists have been pressuring the agency to pare back its requirements. Environmentalists and investors who focus on sustainability have been pushing back, demanding aggressive regulations that they say are needed to protect everyday investors and professionals managing billions of dollars from the financial risks that are being created by global warming. Now, almost 19 months since the SEC proposed its climate rules, the big question is whether the agency will make companies report the most controversial level of pollution known as Scope 3 emissions. That's the pollution linked indirectly to the theoretical shoe company through its suppliers and distributors. For an oil company, Scope 3 emissions include the climate pollution that's released into the atmosphere when people burn its fuel driving their cars and running their lawnmowers. And for a financial firm, they are the emissions that come from the companies and projects it invests in. Opponents of including Scope 3 emissions in climate reporting argue there's no good way right now to accurately measure that pollution, and that flooding investors with unreliable data would be counterproductive. They also say that requiring public companies to report climate pollution from up and down their supply chains could hurt small businesses they work with. Forcing public companies to ""drive climate disclosure policy through their suppliers and distributors may have negative business and social consequences,"" Corteva, the agriculture company,said in a letter to the SEClast year. But Condon, the Boston University law professor, says it's unlikely that small, private businesses would have to do that. ""There's just no universe in which a midsize supplier, grocery chain, is going to ask a small farmer to specifically report on their emissions,"" she says. ""The supplier will calculate the emissions for the farmer."" Despite its objections — and the difficulty of precise measurement — Corteva is one of thousands of companies that has been voluntarily reporting those indirect emissions from its supply chain to investors. Scope 3 emissions are a huge part of the climate problem. For a lot of companies, they account formore than 70% of their total carbon footprint. At Corteva, those indirect emissions accounted for almost 90% of the greenhouse gas emissions that the company reported last year, though they aren't included in targets the company has set for limiting its climate pollution. ""To ignore those emissions, to me, seems to be avoiding the problem,"" Greg Murphy, an executive vice president ata steel company called Nucor, told NPR this summer. Congressional Democrats echoed that message ina letter they sent to Genslerlate last month, saying that disclosing those indirect emissions is ""central to credible climate-related risk reporting for certain sectors and companies."" It isn't clear what the SEC will do. The agency's rules apply to public companies. Because Scope 3 emissions come from a business's suppliers and customers, that kind of climate pollution often traces back to private companies that aren't under the SEC's jurisdiction. But the SEC is also considering the impact of California's new disclosure laws. One of them will require public and private companies that operate in the state and make more than $1 billion a year in revenue to report all of their greenhouse gas pollution, including those indirect Scope 3 emissions.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'canada', 'canada', 'canada', 'canada', 'us', 'us', 'not found']",us,True,True

rainfall to the region.Three French departments—Finistere, Cotes-d'Armor and Manche—will be placed on red storm alert, the highest level, at midnight (2300 GMT), national weather agency Meteo-France said.Meteorologists warned that the Ile-de-France region, which includes the capital Paris, could have violent wind gusts.The SNCF rail network said it would halt service on several of its suburban commuter lines around the capital, including the popular RER A train that serves western suburbs.Two French regions will also be placed on maximum flood alert, it added.Vast stretches along the French coast, from the Gironde region to the northern Hauts de France, will be on the lower category orange alert.In Pas-de-Calais, authorities said they would open two gymnasiums and several shelters for migrants who converge on the region, hoping to make it to Britain by boat.In Britain, the meteorological office said there would be bursts of heavy rain, a risk of flooding in some areas and gusts of 60-70 miles per hour along England's south coast.In France, the storm was even expected to unleash winds of up to 170 kilometers (106 miles) per hour, notably on the coastlines of Brittany and Normandy in the northwest, Meteo-France forecaster Francois Gourand warned on Tuesday.Rainfall could reach 50 millimeters within just six hours in those areas, the weather agency said.Ciaran is expected to hit Brittany before midnight Wednesday, with winds of up to 150 kmph on the coast, and 130 kmph inland with a second, more violent, storm phase following some hours later.Rail services cancelledSome 3,200 firefighters will be deployed in the most exposed areas, the French interior ministry said.Map showing forecast wind gusts between November 1 (1900 GMT) and November 2 (1700 GMT), in western France, placed on high alert due to Storm Ciaran.The authorities, warning of falling trees and blocked roads, have urged people to remain indoors and stay away from the coast.The government also banned all truck traffic in Brittany for Thursday.National rail operator SNCF has stopped regional trains in the most affected areas, and cancelled a number of high-speed TGV rail services.Eurostar, expecting disruptions and slowdowns, told AFP it was recommending that passengers delay any trips planned for Thursday.The Brittany airports of Brest and Quimper were ordered closed, and most ferry traffic to Breton islands is to be stopped.Coastal flooding is likely from early Thursday, Olivier Caumont, also at Meteo-France, told reporters, with waves possibly rising up to 10 meters (33 feet).Maritime authorities issued a strong warning against taking boats out to sea, or even approaching the coast ""be it by car or on foot"".'Lie low, fingers crossed'They also said a powerful tugboat would be deployed to help any vessels in distress.""All we can do is to lie low and keep our fingers crossed,"" said Olivier Laban, president of the shellfish farming committee in the Arcachon basin in France's southwest.In Britain Kate Marks, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said ""significant flooding"" was possible, warning people to stay away from swollen rivers and motorists not to drive through flood water.Storm Ciaran comes less than two weeks after Storm Babet claimed five lives in the UK in heavy flooding and high winds.""Some parts of south Wales and southwest England may see 80 mm (more than three inches) of rain,"" said Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Dan Suri.Officials said coastal flooding is likely from early Thursday.Flooding due to heavy rain has already seen some 12,000 sandbags deployed in the east of Northern Ireland.The Channel Islands, off the coast of northern France, have also been warned to prepare for flooding.As far as SpainIn Belgium, the weather office issued an orange alert for the Flemish coast, a yellow alert for the rest of the country, and urged ""great caution"".The cities of Brussels, Antwerp and Liege announced that parks would be closed.The Flemish provinces of West Flanders and East Flanders both said they would close access to outdoor sports facilities, and ban people from entering forests or natural reserves.In neighboring Netherlands, the weather service issued a code yellow alert for Thursday, while motorists were advised to work from home to avoid traffic jams.Several schools said they would be closed or partially closed Thursday.Ciaran's impact could be felt as far south as Spain, where wind speeds of up to 90 kph were expected for Thursday.Authorities asked people to take down tarpaulins, avoid walking under trees and removing flower pots from balconies.While storms are a naturally recurring phenomenon, they can be made worse by climate change, according to scientists.Flooding is likely to be exacerbated by rising ocean levels as a result of melting glaciers.","['france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france',

In 2018, the damage in Germany alone amounted to around 770 million euros. Making wheat plants more resilient to these stresses could make a significant contribution to safeguarding global food production.As part of the VolCorn project, scientists from four non-university research institutions have been studying, from very different perspectives, howwheat plantsand the microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria that colonize them respond to stress factors caused byextreme weather conditionssuch as drought, flooding or pests.The underlying assumption is that the microbiota, the community of microorganisms in and around the plant, is as important to the plant as microorganisms are to the human immune system. A better understanding of these interactions is therefore central to better preparing plants for these stress situations.Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are produced by the plant and also used to ""communicate"" with the microbiota, play a key role in the plant's defense against these stressors. The researchers have used modern approaches to unravel these complex relationships. They used systems biology methods to study changes inplant metabolismand, at the same time, changes in the microbiota.Microorganisms can help with climate stressThe research shows that floods and droughts not only generally reduce the growth and yield of wheat, but also change the microbiota in the roots and leaves. In particular, more pathogenic microbes colonize the early growth stages. As a result, stressed plants become more susceptible to disease.To the researchers' surprise, however, beneficial bacteria also accumulate in the root zone during flooding, promoting the uptake of nutrients and vitamins by the plant. At the same time, the plant itself massively changes its metabolism.The researchers were able to show that the amino acid alanine plays a central role in maintaining nitrogen supply and metabolism in the stressed plants. ""Presumably, the altered microbiota then makes more supporting vitamins available to support the weakened wheat metabolism in theroot zone,"" explains project coordinator Steffen Kolb from ZALF.Pest infestations affect the formation of VOCs by the wheat plant, which reacts to this form of stress with a defense response. The project also led to the development of a new tool for data analysis of complex mixtures of different VOCs usingmass spectrometry, which will speed up follow-up studies.New insights help breeders and farmers""We hope that in the future we will be able to selectively enrich microbes and their plant-supporting properties to make wheat plants more resilient toclimate change, such as flood stress,"" says Kolb. In plant breeding, for example, work is already underway on programs that encourage plant colonization with supportive microorganisms from the surrounding soil. Another example is the transfer of stress-reducing microorganisms to wheat plants.""The knowledge gained from the multifaceted response of the wheat plant and its microbiota is of great importance for the breeding of climate-resistant wheat varieties and will open new avenues for the systematic management of microorganisms in agricultural crop production. However, furtherexperimental researchis needed due to thecomplex relationshipsinvolved,"" said the project coordinator.Provided by Leibniz-Zentrum für Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF) e.V.Citation: Insights for plant breeding: Arming wheat plants against climate stress with microorganisms (2023, October 26) retrieved 3 November 2023 ",['germany'],gb,False,False

He is the third nominee to fail to secure enough support from his own party members to lead the chamber. Mr Emmer, from Minnesota, emerged as the party's pick in a series of secret internal ballots earlier on Tuesday. But more than 20 Republican lawmakers - and Donald Trump - said that they would not support him. The House has been without a Speaker and has been unable to pass bills since Kevin McCarthy of California was ousted on 3 October. Mr Emmer's decision to drop out of the race puts Republicans back at the start of a quest they have so far struggled to complete - finding a candidate that can win the support of almost all of the party's representatives. During a meeting on Tuesday evening, Republican lawmakers nominated a new set of six candidates: Byron Donalds of Florida, Chuck Fleischmann of Tennessee, Mark Green also of Tennessee, Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Roger Williams of Texas. The sentiment among House Republicans, according to South Carolina's Ralph Norman, is that they should ""stay as long as it takes"" to get a new nominee. Republicans only hold a narrow majority over Democrats in the lower chamber of Congress, so their nominee can only afford to lose a handful of votes from their own side to win. Earlier, nominees Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio both failed to gather enough support to replace Mr McCarthy. Now the same has happened to Mr Emmer, who won the nomination after successive rounds of voting by Republican lawmakers that whittled down eight candidates one by one. Mr Emmer defeated Mike Johnson of Louisiana in the final round but opposition to his nomination became almost immediately apparent. Former President Donald Trump took to his Truth Social platform shortly after to call him a ""Rino"" - Republican In Name Only - who ""never respected the power of a Trump endorsement or the breadth and scope of Maga - Make America Great Again"". Mr Trump added that he believed it would be ""a tragic mistake"" for Republicans to back Mr Emmer. Speaking to reporters following Mr Emmer's withdrawal, Georgia Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene said that she was unable to support him as a result of policy disagreements, including over a bill that provides federal recognition to same-sex marriage. Mr Emmer voted in favour of the legislation, which became law last year. He also voted to certify the results of the 2020 election in favour of the winner, President Joe Biden, a vote that angered Mr Trump's allies. Ms Greene said that the eventual Speaker nomination should reflect the ""will of Republican voters"" who ""overwhelmingly support President Trump"". Mr Emmer, 62, is House Majority Whip, making him the third-most powerful Republican in the chamber. A former college ice hockey player and coach, Mr Emmer also previously served as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, which works to help party candidates win elections across the US. He has held his seat in Congress since 2015, and prior to that served in the Minnesota state legislature. He narrowly lost a race for governor of the state in 2010. Representative Mike Flood of Nebraska - who previously suggested giving temporary speaker Patrick McHenry additional powers - said he would vote ""yes"" on that if it became an option amid the continued inability to elect a Speaker. Mr Flood added that he believes the party ""will find out tonight"" who their nominee is and what the next steps would be. Additionally, Mr Flood said that he believes differences between factions of the party would make any ""unity pledge"" difficult. Several lawmakers expressed frustration with the inability to reach consensus. Among them was Georgia's Rich McCormick, who told reporters that the process ""is not helping at all"". Steve Womack of Arkansas also said that he believes the Republican conference is at ""an impasse"" and that it is ""apparent to the American public that the GOP conference is hopelessly divided"". He said he did not want to predict when a next vote for the nominee will take place.

""Road connectivity between districts has been cut off and bridges have been washed away,"" Mr Tamang told the Press Trust of India on Friday. The army said it was providing food and medical aid to people and extending communication facilities to civilians and stranded tourists. Rescue teams are also moving evacuees to relief camps. All schools and colleges in the state will remain closed until 15 October due to inclement weather. On Tuesday night, the state's Lhonak lake breached its embankment after heavy rain, leading to an alarming rise in water in the Teesta river in Lachen Valley. The flood worsened after water was released from a nearby dam into the river. A defence spokesperson reported a rapid surge in water levels downstream, reaching heights of 15 to 20 feet. Satellite images shared by Isro, India's space agency, showed dramatic changes in the volume of the lake. The lake covered an area of 167.4 hectares on 28 September, but by 4 October, it had shrunk to just 60.3 hectares. The floods had caused massive damage to infrastructure, including roads and bridges. Northern parts of neighbouring West Bengal state have been affected as water from the Teesta inundated Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri districts. Two people were killed and six others injured after a mortar shell, found in the overflowing river, blew up in Jalpaiguri, officials said. Sikkim in the Himalayas is prone to floods and natural disasters. Last year, severe flooding there displaced tens of thousands and killed at least 24 people. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

""Wildfires are a problem and they're dangerous,"" they say in their podcast from Chautauqua Elementary School, on Vashon Island. ""But there's ways to prevent them, so respect wildfire safety precautions and do your best to prevent these fires."" This entryfrom Roz Hinds, Jia Khurana and Sadie Pritsky was among more than 100 podcasts this year inNPR's Student Podcast Challengethat touched on a topic that's increasingly important to young people:climate change. Over and over again, student journalists tried making sense of extreme weather events that are becoming more common or more intense: flash floods, hurricanes, droughts, wildfires. Here are four student podcasts that offer a glimpse into the minds of students and what they have to say about climate-related news in their communities — and what they hope to do about it. Behind the Scenes of the Mosquito FireIn a 10-episode series, a sixth-grade class at the Georgetown School of Innovation in Georgetown, Calif., shares stories from the devastatingMosquitoFire in 2022. This group of eight students asks two firefighters from the Georgetown Fire Department what it's like to fight fires and protect loved ones in their hometown. Fires: Set AblazeAt Chautauqua Elementary, the Vashon fifth-graders talk about the far-reaching and lasting impact of wildfires and wildfire smoke — and the direct effects on their lives, like waiting for the school bus on a smoky day. The students also interview experts and share their research on wildfire precautions. Flowing Through Time: The Past, Present, and Future of WaterIn this podcast from Peak Academy, a group of eight middle schoolers reports on dealing with water shortages in Bozeman, Montana. They trace the history of their growing hometown's water supply, which has been dependent on mountain snowmelt. As that source becomes less reliable in a warming world, the students turn to the grown-ups to ask what they can do to conserve water.

The sinking has contributed to worsening flood risks, including at sporting arenas, roadways, and a busy airport. A study on the slight elevation changes throughout the city was published in the journal Science Advances last week. Researchers from NASA and Rutgers University documented the city rising and sinking at different rates from 2016 to 2023 by using a remote sensing technique called interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). This combines several 3D observations of a region to reveal changes over time. Through those observations, the researchers found that the NYC metropolitan area is sinking at a median rate of about 1.6 millimeters (0.06 inches) a year. Several locations around the city, including Arthur Ashe Stadium in Queens, a runway at LaGuardia Airport, and Interstate 78 (this includes the Holland Tunnel), are sinking at a rate of more than 2 millimeters (0.07 inches) per year. That sounds tiny, but it adds up over time to increase flood risk throughout the city. There’s an ancient reason for some of this sinking. During the most recent ice age, which ended over 11,000 years ago, much of the Northeast U.S. was covered in ice, a post from NASA explains; much of New York City sits on land that was once slightly elevated and is now coming back down. Development has also played a role. Some of the sinking locations, like LaGuardia Airport, were built on top of landfills. The sinking has occurred alongside a worsening climate crisis that has increased flooding from rising ocean levels and heavier rainfall. Sea levels around Manhattan rose by more than 4 millimeters a year between 2000 and 2022. “The city has long dealt with coastal flooding from both hurricanes and extratropical storms, but as seen with Superstorm Sandy in 2012, storm surges associated with severe weather events are becoming more destructive because of ongoing sea level rise,” the study authors wrote. “The relative rise in sea level during the 20th century resulted in an additional $8.1 billion in damages from Sandy than would have occurred a century prior.” Residents have witnessed the consequences first hand. Despite billions of dollars of updates to LaGuardia Airport, that area has not been spared from damage due to extreme weather. Late last week, heavy rainfall over the NYC area created flash flooding in subway stations, across highways, and at the airport. Travelers had to wade through several inches of water in the terminals, NBC New York reported. Researchers also found that some parts of New York are actually rising. They noted that Newton Creek in Brooklyn is rising at a rate of about 1.6 millimeters (0.06 inches) a year, while the neighborhood of Woodside, Queens rose about 6.9 millimeters (0.27 inches) between May 2016 to December 2019.

Numerous homes and public buildings were also affected.Inour research, we looked at how extreme weather had impactedurban areas.Urban poor and water-related problemsWestudiedthree flood-prone cities in Indonesia: Pontianak (West Kalimantan Province), Bima (West Nusa Tenggara Province) and Manado (West Sulawesi Province).We used fieldwork visits, observations, interviews and document analysis. We interviewed 57 informants during the data collection process, including government actors,community leaders, civil society organization activists, and business people.Our research aimed to understand howurban developmentcontributed to urban water problems within the wider context of extreme weather change.It found climate-related problems such as flooding, drought, andheat stressmay affect the whole city, regardless of rich orpoor neighborhoods. However, urban poor populations suffer more severely due to some reasons.While the rich has resources to live in well-planned residential areas, urban poor have to live inparts most vulnerableto floods.In addition to that, they also live in crowded and impoverished neighborhoods with limited access to clean water.Marginalized from formal water services, the urban poor are accustomed torelying on their own creativity for survival. They drill boreholes, make wells, build wet ponds or install rainwater catchment.The same goes when dealing with flooding. They swiftly store valuables in high places, monitor the rise of water level in the nearby drains, creeks or rivers. They also establishcommunication channelsthroughdigital platformsto be informed as soon as possible when flood risks emerge to organize mitigating measures.However, those are merely reactive measures that have nothing to do with addressing the underlying problems.Results from unequal developmentWe found water-related problems in Indonesia, such asflooding and water shortageare closely tiedto unequal developmentacross different parts of the city. All the cities we studied showed common patterns.In certain parts of the city,the economy has experienced significant growthgiving rise to upscale neighborhoods with tall buildings, thriving business districts and real estates with large shopping centers nearby.However, this rapid development has led to surges in land prices, housing rents and the cost of essentials like water and electricity. As a result, these areas have become inaccessible to the urban poor.Meanwhile, in rural and less developed areas, people have converted forests into agricultural lands to meet the increasing demands of city inhabitants, causing disruption of the natural water cycle.As a result, whenextreme weatherstrikes, the urban area struggles to cope. Heavy rainfall increases the risk of flooding, while during droughts they struggle to findclean water.What can we do?Our findings show that profit-seeking activities by developers combined with poor policies have exacerbated water disasters which affected urban poor the most. These communities find it hard to adjust and improve their lives in the midst of urgent water-related issues.However, our study recommended measures that can improve the conditions of urban poor in facing water-related disasters, and not just the reactive ones.The first step is making sure water management practices support the resilience of communities.It's important to consider and tackle inequalities across various areas. For instance, we can integrate the built environment to reconnect people with rivers within urban life.The second step is to consider the risks of climate change when making decisions about water-related institutions and services. We need to find ways to fund preventive measures and disaster response in a sustainable and responsive manner.Lastly, it's crucial to plan our infrastructure carefully. We should include strong and repairable options in our plans. To do this, we need to involve the community in decision-making processes and raise awareness about these issues.In the long run, these recommendations will integrate actions into the whole water cycle to protect services, the environment and public health.","['us', 'southkorea', 'pakistan', 'turkey', 'indonesia', 'indonesia', 'indonesia', 'indonesia', 'not found', 'saudiarabia']",gb,False,False

For example, scientists are already using the data to dig into new techniques for improving long-range forecasting, planning for water resource allocation, and to better understand the causes and impacts of extreme and rareweatherevents.The dataset, known as CONUS404, is the result of a collaboration between the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).""To study rare andextreme weather eventsthat we are really interested in, you need decades worth of data and that data need to be at high resolution,"" said Roy Rasmussen, the NCAR senior scientist who led the project. ""With CONUS404 it is possible to study both long-term events that can stretch for many years, like droughts, and rare events that don't last long but rarely occur, like extreme floods.""Filling a gap for water managersThe weather in the United States is relatively well observed by local weather stations, stream gauges, snowpack sensors, radars, weather balloons, satellites, and more. But on their own, these observations cannot always give a clear picture of how weather patterns may be changing over time. That's because the data are often regionally clumped—with sparse information on conditions in remote and rugged terrain—and unreliable. The accuracy of temperature, humidity, winds and other important weather data, for example, can be affected by instrument performance and local conditions. And measurements across different observational platforms do not always line up.Because of these factors, scientists rely on meteorological ""reanalyses"" that combine observations and modeling to create datasets that provide internally consistent weather information at fixed points on a grid across an entire region or the globe. These reanalysis products are important tools for scientists. For example, they can be used to verify how wellclimate modelsare able to simulate past conditions—a crucial test for determining how well they might be doing at simulating the future. Scientists also use these products to initialize, or ""kick off,""model simulationswith real-world conditions.Despite the importance of reanalysis products, they are generally low resolution with about 30 kilometers (19 miles) or more between grid points—a spacing too coarse to capture relatively fine-scale weather events, like summer thunderstorms, and the local topography that impacts those events, like mountain ranges. They're also too coarse to give meaningful data about precipitation in individual watersheds, which is critical information for water managers. It's this last point that has been a particular frustration for the USGS, which is responsible for collecting and distributing information to the nation about water resources, including streamflow and groundwater data.To address this gap, the USGS partnered with NCAR to ""downscale"" one of the most widely used global reanalysis datasets, called ERA5, to create a high-resolution dataset for the contiguous United States (CONUS) using NCAR's Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF).The resulting dataset covers more than 40 years (1980–2021) at 4-kilometer grid spacing—hence the name, CONUS404.A weather simulation that covers such a large area over such a long time at such a high resolution has never before been possible. But several factors have come together over the last decade to make the undertaking practical, including an advancement in capabilities of both supercomputing and of weather models. Even with advances in computing, it still took more than 11 months to complete the simulation on the USGS Denali supercomputing system.Improvements in WRF over the last few years have corrected several issues that showed up in earlier attempts to run the model at high resolution over CONUS, though for shorter time periods. One problem was that WRF tended to make the central U.S. too hot and too dry, which in turn affected the ability of the model to accurately simulate thunderstorms in the region. But the updated version of WRF includes a groundwater module that both cools and dampens the area, leading to a much more realistic simulation. The updated version also does a better job of simulating Western snowpack, which affects stream runoff andsurface temperatures, and corrects a tendency in the model to make wintertime temperatures too cold in snow-covered regions.""We're now able to capture the primary factors that are causing the weather in the real world,"" Rasmssen said. ""We're not perfect, and we're still learning all the time, but the model does a striking job of getting the historical weather right.""Digging into the dataThe paperintroducing the dataset was published earlier this summer in theBulletin of the American Meteorological Society, but many scientists are already digging into the data to answer their research questions. For example, the CONUS404 dataset has helped researchers uncover patterns during historical droughts that are now being used to improve seasonal drought predictions in the West.Scientists are also looking for subtle evidence of changing weather patterns over the last few decades, including one study that has identified a shift in the way precipitation falls, from less drizzle and light rain to more downpours. Climate models have long predicted that this change should be occurring, but the low-resolution reanalysis datasets that existed up to this point were not detailed enough to pinpoint the change.Researchers are also analyzing changes to the damaging local winds that sometimes accompany storms. Other scientists are looking at extremes in streamflow and whether CONUS404 data can be used as an input into crop models to simulatewater useand food production.While the new dataset has just begun to be tapped, the NCAR-USGS collaboration is already working on part two of the project: another 40-plus year simulation of weather across the United States, this time in the future. The scientists will be using the same methodology, but instead of downscaling a reanalysis of what has happened in the past, they'll be using data from NCAR's Community Earth System Model, version 2, (CESM2) to project what they believe conditions will be like in the future. Together, the two datasets will provide more than 80 years of simulated data that will give an unprecedented look of how our weather may continue to change as the climate warms.""Connecting these two pieces—NCAR's climate and weather modeling—is extremely important,"" said NCAR scientist Andreas Prein, a co-author of the study. ""We have to be smart about how we use the climate data to bring it to a scale that's useful.""CONUS404 data is freely accessible fromNCAR's Research Data Archive.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us']",gb,False,False

This year had already registered 38 such days by mid-September.The more ambitious Paris Agreement target of 1.5C will be measured over decades.But lead author William Ripple, professor at Oregon State University, said we are likely entering a period where annual temperatures will reach that level or higher, risking danger from climate feedback loops and tipping points.""Once crossed, these tipping points could change our climate in ways that may be difficult or impossible to reverse,"" he told AFP.These could include the meltdown of the ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica, thawing of large areas of permafrost and widespread coral reef die back.With sometipping points""we're not going to avoid them now, it's more about slowing the damage"", said co-author Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of ExeterTo do that, emissions must be slashed and temperature rise curbed.Change in carbon emissions in Canada since 2003.Every fraction of a degree matters, Lenton told AFP: ""There's still a lot to play for.""That includes the number of people who might face intolerable conditions in coming decades, like severe heat, limited food availability and climate extremes.The report said three to six billion people could be ""confined beyond the livable region"" by century's end.""Many world leaders have generally continued to support business as usual, rather than enacting policies to curb climate change and sustain life on Earth,"" said Ripple.""We hope recent extreme weather events will help motivate policymakers at the upcoming COP28 climate conference to support massive cuts in fossil fuel emissions and increased funding forclimateadaptation, especially in the world's most vulnerable regions.""","['unitedarabemirates', 'brazil', 'us', 'china', 'india', 'canada', 'canada', 'canada', 'greenland']",gb,False,False

Weather can have a huge impact on the successful operation and bottom line of family entertainment centers. With hotter summers and more extreme weather, planning is key to profitability. Excessive heat, torrential rain, snowstorms, wildfires resulting in poor air quality—the list goes on, as does the need for planning and preparation. As an Eagle Scout, my motto is “Be prepared,” and as the operator of multiple family entertainment centers (FECs), my team and I practice planning and preparation. This experience has shown me that being proactive impacts safety, staffing and sales. Here's what FECs need to keep in mind. Be nimble when the weather changes. Many FEC operators look at bad weather and decide to close for the day instead of finding the silver lining in every cloud. FECs in Florida, for example, know that a passing rain shower is no big deal, so most folks go about their business. But in dry areas of California, inclement weather can paralyze those unfamiliar with driving in the rain. Monitor weather conditions, and be nimble. In my experience, most operators don’t cut staff quickly enough when bad weather is in the forecast for their area. When you see cancellations, cut staff and hours immediately. But before shutting down completely, look first at how you can leverage the weather to your advantage. For example, chilly evenings are an opportunity to promote hot toddies by the fire pit or savoring drinks under the stars warmed by a cozy patio heater. Excessive heat is an invitation to come inside and enjoy icy, cool air conditioning in the arcade. Rainy days at home with the kids are no fun; get them out of the house and actively gaming in the arcade while you sip a beverage and supervise—everyone wins. Any opportunity to position your FEC as a respite from the weather should be maximized to generate revenues. If you are not prepared, you will lose sales. Develop advertising and social media messaging templates in advance so you can quickly react to changing weather situations. Prioritize safety and comfort for guests and staff. For FECS with an outdoor component such as miniature golf, kiddie rides, batting cages, go-karts or laser tag, begin by reviewing your assets. How can you deal with extreme heat? Shade trees are an option but require time to mature. Awnings, sunshades, umbrellas and shade sails can help cool areas on a permanent or semi-permanent basis, while an outdoor misting system or portable misters can help to keep guests and employees comfortable. Hydration stations stocked with cold drinks, along with a gift shop carrying personal fans, sunglasses, hats, umbrellas and sunscreen, are additional revenue streams. Guests won’t stay if they're too hot, so keep them cool. Make sure your team members are properly hydrated and safe in excessive heat as well. Rotational shifts, extra water and cooling breaks, wick-away garments, reflective gear and lightweight uniforms can make a big difference in safety, comfort and performance. Inclement weather might require rain gear, while cold weather calls for heaters, windbreakers, jackets, heavier uniforms and proper footwear. Some of this branded gear can also be sold in your gift shop as fan swag and souvenirs. Wildfires and poor air quality present both challenges and opportunities. When the air quality is bad, make sure your team members are safe and close unless your FEC has a big enough indoor component such as laser tag, video gaming or an arcade. These assets can be leveraged to offer comfortable indoor fun in a climate-controlled environment, so employ your pre-developed sales strategies and templates to advertise and promote an attractive and fun alternative on social media in real time. The bottom line: Have a plan for any weather. For clear skies and smooth sailing in any weather, have a plan and a program in place. Develop strategies and tactics for everything from a sprinkle to a downpour, as well as plans for lightning, hurricanes and named storms that require securing anything that could float or blow away. Be proactive, monitor weather conditions and be ready to act quickly. Being prepared just might make you more profitable.

They’ve also worked to improve communications between retailers and suppliers to anticipate disruptions, but storms still impact production. With three months left in 2023, the U.S. has already set a record for the most billion-dollar weather events in one year and, globally, the hottest summer on record. This kind of extreme weather plays a significant part in the volatility in the oil and gas sector, resulting in prices, supply and demand often swinging drastically from hour to hour. While shorter than recessions, weather events have super-sized effects on the entire oil and gas supply chain. Hurricanes Many kinds of weather can affect supply, from blizzards and ice storms to tornadoes and flooding, but most notable are tropical systems. Nearly half of the total petroleum refinery capacity and 51% of the total natural gas processing plant capacity in the United States is along the Gulf Coast, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This area is also historically in the path of many tropical storms and hurricanes. These storms don’t just impact land operations but also up to hundreds of miles out to sea, where extreme storms can disrupt everything from shipping routes to drilling platforms. According to the EIA, a “high impact” hurricane that disrupts Gulf of Mexico crude production by 80pc could increase monthly average retail gasoline prices by up to 30¢/USG. This year’s Hurricane Idalia put pressure on the Gulf operations, with three platforms evacuating employees, and traders watching the impending storm drive oil prices up in the days before landfall. In the past, other notable storms have impacted the industry, including Hurricane Zeta in 2021, which drove an 8-million-barrel drop in regional oil stocks that affected the broader U.S. supply. In response to the growing threats from these extreme storms, many refineries have hardened their plants and taken steps to reduce flooding. Extreme Temperatures We are already seeing cooler temperatures as we move into autumn, which is a relief from the months of unrelenting high temperatures. Extreme temperatures—hot or cold—have a significant impact beyond consumer demand. Refineries, which are typically designed to operate between 32 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit, can experience equipment malfunctions, reduce production capacity and create unsafe working environments, which can further delay operations under extreme heat conditions. Although tropical systems are typically associated with oil and gas disruption, extreme temperatures can cause more production loss. For example, in February 2021, frigid temperatures shut down more U.S. refinery capacity than Hurricane Harvey. The extended cold spell caused 5.6 million b/d of outages along the U.S. Gulf Coast and Midwest compared to Hurricane Harvey, reducing production of nearly 4 million barrels of oil per day. The bitter cold brought about by the 2021 Polar Vortex was a stark reminder of the cascading effect extremely low temperatures have on the oil and gas industry. The storm caused wellhead freeze-offs and power outages that debilitated gas producers, leading to a shortage of gas when demand was spiking. Gas shortages combined with iced-down processing units led to individual unit outages and entire closures at 25 refineries in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Tennessee. Freezing temperatures can cause malfunctions that might require a shutdown, such as flow control equipment failure or frozen product within the piping system. It can also create a hazardous situation when the weather warms up. When the temperature drops, the liquid freezes in the pipe and expands. This expansion can cause the pipe to crack, and once the temperature rises, the pipe will start to leak, creating a potential fire hazard. And even though we have moved beyond extreme high temperatures for now, it is important to note that extreme heat affects a refinery’s ability to run at full capacity and can limit the electricity supply refiners need to run their operations. For example, this year the utilization rate in the Gulf Coast fell in June and July, with several sizable outages in the region in July and August. The Increase of Extreme Weather Events As most research points to extreme weather events increasing in frequency and intensity, the oil and gas industry is already improving its preparation and response. The introduction of new standards, processes and hardened equipment indicates the industry is preparing for current weather impact and future climate changes. One area that can further build resilience is by tapping into integrated real-time weather insights. From optimizing shipping routes for vessels carrying natural gas and petroleum to protecting employees on offshore platforms, or proactively planning for unavoidable weather events, weather intelligence can enhance efficiencies and support safe operations. Further, when these weather insights, such as what regions, terminals and refineries are likely to be affected, are coupled with fuel demand data, supply chain players can plan ahead to make strategic supply, pricing and purchasing decisions.","['us', 'us', 'us', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",us,True,True

The small city of about 8,000 is celebrating its ongoing recovery withfoodtrucks, music and street performers in hopes of drawing visitors downtown and giving shops a chance to sell their merchandise in sidewalk sales. “It's really a way to acknowledge our progress,"" said Katie Trautz, executive director of Montpelier Alive, a group that holds events and promotes city businesses. “It's a symbolic kind of reopening celebration, like we're turning a page here. .... Businesses are reopening every week.” Rain will likely fall at times during the two-day event, although Trautz said a weather forecaster has assured organizers that heavy rains will likely be west of the city. Trautz said at least 125 Montpelier businesses were damaged in the July flooding that filled basements and lower floors of businesses with water and obscured vehicles and all but the tops of parking meters downtown. Some resident canoed and kayaked along main streets, while others slogged through the waist-high water to survey the scene. Since then, 15 to 20 businesses have reopened and 10 have officially closed, Trautz said. She estimates that 80% will reopen “but it will take a long time.” “What we’re trying to do is also give businesses an opportunity to sell their merchandise and be recognized and keep the attention on Montpelier because this is not over,” Trautz said. She also noted that the fall, a popular time for tourists who flock to the state to see colorful foliage, is when businesses traditionally make the money that gets them through the end of the year. The celebration includes an art walk on Friday evening, the farmer’s market on Saturday morning, and the Taste of Montpelier Food Festival in the afternoon with 20 food trucks offering fare from around Vermont. A singing group will hold a benefit for Montpelier flood relief on the Statehouse lawn on Saturday afternoon and the Kellogg Hubbard Library will celebrate its own grand reopening with crafts, snacks, and the finale of its fundraising auction. A West African drumming event takes place in front of City Hall at 6 p.m. followed by a play performed at Lost Nation Theater. Solonge Breceduong, visiting from Montreal, said Friday that she was initially surprised to see so many businesses closed, but then remembered the flood. “I think that people here are very resilient. ... You can see the hope on their face, so I really like Vermont for that,” she said. Kelly Tackett, owner of the children's clothing shop Minikin, decided just last weekend that she would reopen. “It was a rollercoaster of ups and downs of what to do,” Tackett said Friday, adding that it took her two months to figure out the right way to submit a loan application to the Small Business Administration. “Without any assistance, I didn't think there was any way I could pull this off starting from scratch again."" Trautz said many more businesses expect to open in the next couple of weeks. And in the next few months, she said, “I think downtown Montpelier will look really different than it does now.”","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'italy', 'canada']",us,True,True

That's a welcome boon to a state that has spent much of the past dozen years in a deep drought, forcing state leaders to grapple with how the state should share and manage its water in the future. A series of winter storms in early 2023 busted the state's most recent dry spell. State officials measured 33.56 inches (85.2 centimeters) of precipitation through the end of September. California's “water year” begins annually on Oct. 1 so it can include all of the fall and winter months when California gets the bulk of its rain and snow. The state depends on those wet months to fill its reservoirs that supply water for drinking, farming and environmental uses throughout the state. Those reservoirs dipped to dangerously low levels in in recent years because of an extreme drought. That prompted water restrictions on homes and businesses and curtailed deliveries to farmers. It also threatened already endangered species of fish, including salmon, that need cold water in the rivers to survive. Statewide, reservoirs held 27.4 million acre feet of stored water as September ended. One acre foot of water is enough to supply two families of four for a year. Of that, about 4.5 million acre feet are held in the State Water Project, a network of 30 reservoirs and storage facilities that provides water to 27 million people. “This was as close to a miracle year as you can get,” said Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources. The reservoirs were helped by a series of nine strong storms that hit California over the winter. Those storms carried so much rain and snow they were known as “atmospheric rivers.” They caused widespread flooding throughout the state and were blamed for multiple deaths. The storms also dumped tons of snow on the mountains. The state snowpack on April 1 was 237% above its historical average. It's just the fourth time since 1950 the state's snowpack exceeded 200% of average, according to Michael Anderson, the state's climatologist. All of that snow melted in the spring and summer, filling rushing rivers and reservoirs. Water levels at Lake Oroville rose 240 feet (73 meters) between Dec. 1, 2022, and the end of the snowmelt period. That's the largest increase in storage in one season since the reservoir opened in 1968, according to Ted Craddock, deputy director for the State Water Project. State and federal officials will have to drain some of the reservoirs to make room for more water that's expected to come this year. The state's rainy season could be complicated by El Nino — the natural, temporary and occasional warming of part of the Pacific Ocean. El Nino affects weather patterns around the world. California typically gets more rain and snow during El Nino year. This year’s El Nino has a 56% chance to be considered strong and a 25% chance to reach supersized levels, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The potential for more strong storms this year, particularly along the coast, “keeps me awake a little bit at night,” said Gary Lippner, deputy director for flood management and dam safety with the California Department of Water Resources. “We just do not have extensive flood systems on the coast of California,” he said. “That's an area we're paying particularly attention to.” All of the rain and snow this year could have played a part in what has so far been a smaller wildfire season. Wildfires exploded in size during the drought in part because of the super dry conditions. So far this year, just over 476 square miles (1,234 square kilometers) have burned in California. That's well below the five year average of 2,031 square miles (5,260 square kilometers), according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. ___ This story has been updated to correct the amount of acre feet of storage the reservoirs in the State Water Project finished the year with. It was 4.5 million acre feet, not 27.4 million.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",us,True,True

The impacts are not over as further rain is expected.The risk was clear well before the event. Storm Babet wasofficially namedby the UK Met Office on Monday October 16 and a rarered weather warningwas issued on the Wednesday, 32 hours before the heaviest rain started.Red weather warnings areused by the Met Officeto communicateextreme weather eventsthat pose a risk to life. This was only the fourth time a redwarninghad been issued for rainfall.The Scottish Government's Resilience Operation wasactivated,flood defenses were closed, roads and bridgesshut, households evacuated and emergency rest centers opened. These advance warnings undoubtedly kept many people safe.How did forecasters know it was coming?Meteorologists were tracking the storm using satellites and weather observations. Every day they became more confident about when and where the heaviest rainfall would land.Storm Babet is anunusual weather system. Storms that hit the UK in the autumn and winter normally come from the west across the Atlantic, but Babet instead traveled from Portugal, picking up moisture from the Bay of Biscay before being trapped over the UK by a hard-to-budge high pressure system across Scandinavia. This resulted in a prolonged period of wet and windy weather and widespread flooding.Babet causes rain across almost the entire British Isles at once. Map shows rainfall from 6pm October 19 to 6am October 20 2023: the white and black colours show the areas of heaviest rainfall. Credit:Starling Roost Weather integrated radar (Data: Met Office),CC BY-SAThe heaviest rainfall has been over the Angus hills in eastern Scotland, visible in white and black in the map below. As UK weather systems tend to come from the west, dumping their rain over the first hills they encounter, the eastern side of Scotland is usually protected from the worst of the weather. That is why forecasters were particularly concerned.The previous highest 24-hour rainfall in the area was 100mm recorded in November 2022, with 60mm-70mm recorded during Storm Frank in 2015. The rainfall from Storm Babet is alreadyover 160mm. Unlike those in western Scotland, rivers in the region are simply not big enough to carry that much rainfall without bursting their banks.What hydrologists knewHydrologistssuch as myself study how water moves across and through the landscape, which is key to forecasting floods. Alongside the exceptionally high rainfall, other factors made Angus and south-east Aberdeenshire particularly vulnerable. The hills funnel water into steep rivers that rise quickly and rush towards the sea, so towns and villages along them areno strangers to floods.In this instance, heavy rain ten days ago meant that the ground was already saturated. Instead of soaking into the ground, any rain that fell during Storm Babet would quickly have flowed into the streams and rivers causing them to overflow.Scotland has a rainy side and a dry side. Credit: Met Office,CC BY-SAA storm like this is far beyond anything experienced in living memory of those in the region. Without any first hand knowledge to rely on, computer models help forecasters identify where the biggest floods will be. With Babet, hydrological models were able to pinpoint the area of concern (the redweatherwarning) to the rivers draining off the Angus hills.Similar models predicted that the South Esk river would rise above its flood defenses in the town of Brechin, meaningfloodwarnings could be issued and the difficult decision toevacuate 400 residentsto safety could be made on Thursday afternoon rather than in the middle of the night. It turned out to be good decision, as by Friday morning the river in Brechin was at its highest level on record, and had indeedbreached its defenses.Preparing for more extreme events in the futureThis is yet another reminder that the climate is changing and we will see more extreme rainfall, putting more people at risk. The ""Clausius-Clapeyron"" relationship states that for every 1°C increase in air temperature there is 7% more moisture—meaning that there is morerainfallin a given downpour.The relationship between this and flooding ismore complexsince it also involves interactions with the landscape (How have urban areas expanded? Are there many trees? What sort of farms are there? Are rivers forced into embankments or allowed to meander through floodplains?).Flood forecasting model from the day before the storm peaked. The purple and red colours show the rivers expected to see the highest flows. Credit:Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) / UKCEH,CC BY-SABut understanding these interactions is urgent. TheBrechin flood defenseswere completed in 2016 and designed to protect the town from floods up to a 1-in-200-year event. No one expected them to be topped less than ten years later.Despite the devastation evident today, the value of advance warnings for Storm Babet for saving lives, property and infrastructure is clear. To help the UK be better prepared for floods, many hydrologists—including me—are working together through the newUK Flood Hydrology Roadmapto further improve the science and data underlying those warnings.","['uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'turkey', 'turkey', 'turkey', 'portugal']",gb,True,True

It is the first step in what could become the EU's inaugural investigation under theDigital Services Act, in this case to determine if the site formerly known as Twitter is in compliance with the tough new rules meant to keep users safe online and stop the spread of harmful content. San Francisco-based X has until Wednesday to respond to questions related to how its crisis response protocol is functioning. Responses to other questions must be received by Oct. 31. The commission said its next steps, which could include the opening of formal proceedings and penalties, would be determined by X's replies. Representatives for X did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. The company's CEO, Linda Yaccarino, said earlier that the site has removed hundreds of Hamas-linked accounts and taken down or labeled tens of thousands of pieces of content since the militant group's attack on Israel. One social media expert called the actions “a drop in the bucket."" Yaccarino on Thursday outlined steps taken by X to combat illegal content flourishing on the platform. She was responding to an earlier letter from a top European Union official for information on how X is complying with the EU's new digital rules during the Israel-Hamas war. That letter, which essentially served as a warning, was not legally binding — the latest one, however, is. “X is proportionately and effectively assessing and addressing identified fake and manipulated content during this constantly evolving and shifting crisis,” Yaccarino said in a letter to European Commissioner Thierry Breton, the 27-nation bloc's digital enforcer. But some say the efforts are not nearly enough to tackle the problem. “While these actions are better than nothing, it is not enough to curtail the misinformation problem on X,” said Kolina Koltai, a researcher at the investigative collective Bellingcat who previously worked at Twitter on Community Notes. “There is an overwhelming amount of misinformation on the platform,"" Koltai said. ""From what we have seen, the moderation efforts from X are only addressing a drop in the bucket.” Since the war erupted, photos and videos have flooded social media of the carnage, including haunting footage of Hamas fighters taking terrified Israelis hostage, alongside posts from users pushing false claims and misrepresenting videos from other events. The conflict is one of the first major tests for the EU’s groundbreaking digital rules, which took effect in August. Breton fired off a similar letter Thursday to TikTok, telling CEO Shou Zi Chew that he has a “particular obligation” to protect child and teen users from “violent content depicting hostage taking and other graphic videos” reportedly making the rounds on the video sharing app. For X, changes that Musk has made to the platform since he bought it last year mean accounts that subscribe to X's blue-check service can get paid if their posts go viral, creating a financial incentive to post whatever gets the most reaction. Plus, X's workforce — including its content moderation team — has been gutted. Those changes are running up against the EU's Digital Services Act, which forces social media companies to step up policing of their platforms for illegal content, such as terrorist material or illegal hate speech, under threat of hefty fines. “There is no place on X for terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups and we continue to remove such accounts in real time, including proactive efforts,” Yaccarino wrote in the letter posted to X. X has taken action to “remove or label tens of thousands of pieces of content,” Yaccarino said, pointing out that there are 700 unique Community Notes — a feature that allows users to add their own fact-checks to posts — ""related to the attacks and unfolding events."" The platform has been “responding promptly” and in a “diligent and objective manner” to takedown requests from law enforcement agencies from around the world, including more than 80 from EU member states, Yaccarino said. Koltai, the researcher and former Twitter employee, said Community Notes are not an “end-all solution to curtailing misinfo” and that there are gaps that the feature just can't fill yet. “There are still many videos and photos on X that don’t have notes that are unmoderated, and continue to spread misleading claims,” she said. Since Musk acquired Twitter and renamed it, social-media watchers say the platform has become not just unreliable but actively promotes falsehoods, while a study commissioned by the EU found that it's the worst-performing platform for online disinformation. Rivals such as TikTok, YouTube and Facebook also are coping with a flood of unsubstantiated rumors and falsehoods about the Middle Eastern conflict, playing the typical whack-a-mole that erupts each time a news event captures world attention. Breton, the EU official, urged TikTok's leader to step up its efforts at tackling disinformation and illegal content and respond within 24 hours. The company did not reply immediately to an email seeking comment. Breton's warning letters have also gone to Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook and Instagram parent Meta. —AP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay in Oakland, California, contributed to this report.","['unitedkingdom', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",us,True,False

One of the possibly richest areas of research might be infections among the very young, who tend to bespared from more serious COVID-19 disease.Hospitalization ratesfor infants four years old or under dropped to under 1 per 100,000 earlier this year, and have recently inched up slightly to 2 per 100,000 in the middle of September, compared to rates for people over 65 years old, which hit a low of 6 per 100,000 earlier this year and climbed up to 17.6 in September. In astudy published recently in the journalCell, researchers led by Bali Pulendran, a professor of pathology, microbiology, and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine, report some key differences in how infants and adults experience COVID-19 infections, which could lead to new ways of generating stronger and more durable immunity in the future. Read more:Most Kids Do Not Get Severe COVID-19, Large Study Confirms Pulendran and his team took advantage of samples collected from children at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital in 2020, before COVID-19 vaccines were available. Doctors took weekly nasal samples from the infants, who ranged in age from one month to nearly four years old, and some developed COVID-19 infections, so the researchers captured immune cell activity in the nasal passages before, during, and after infection. They found that unlike in adults, infants, especially the youngest babies, produce strong antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2, and these antibodies remained at relatively high levels throughout the study period of nearly a year. “In the case of COVID-19, this is certainly unique and new,” says Pulendran. “We hadn’t expected to see this in infants. When adults get infected, they see an increase in the antibody response in the months following the infection, and then a sharp decay in that level. But in the babies, we didn’t see that happening. In fact, in some babies, the antibodies kept rising, and in others they plateaued, but they did not decline.” The scientists also discovered another key difference in the way babies responded to the COVID-19 virus. While adultsdevelop a strong inflammatory responsein the blood soon after infection, as the virus triggers a flood of cytokines and other compounds that can cause complications associated with serious COVID-19 disease, infants did not develop this same reaction in the blood. In fact, in their blood, levels of these inflammatory markers did not increase appreciably. However, these factors were abundant in the nasal passages of the babies, suggesting that for them, the battle between the immune system and the virus was occurring primarily in the mucosal tissues of the nose and upper respiratory tract, and not throughout the body in the bloodstream. The mucous membranes of these babies were flooded with interferon in particular, which is a potent immune hormone that can control how much a virus replicates. “It’s as if in infants the virus infects the upper respiratory tract but this infection is nipped in the bud there,” says Pulendran. The reason that the antibodies generated by babies last so much longer than those generated by adults isn’t clear, but could have to do with the fact that infants may be relying on a type of immune response known as the innate response. It’s a first line of defense, and doesn’t involve educating immune cells like antibodies and T cells by exposing them to pathogens first. Because the immune systems in babies are still developing, it’s possible that they are more reliant on this more rudimentary, innate immune response and that could explain the longer lasting protection they have. But, says Pulendran, “it’s one of the great mysteries in immunology why in some cases like measles and chickenpox, you only need to have one infection during childhood and you are protected for your entire life, because the half life of the antibodies against them lasts years and years, but with other infections like flu and COVID-19, the half life of antibodies is more on the order of a few hundred days.” Read more:The Coronavirus Seems to Spare Most Kids From Illness, but Its Effect on Their Mental Health Is Deepening There are tradeoffs to the infants’ immune responses, however. The scientists found that the antibodies the babies generated, while abundant and durable, were more specifically targeted to the virus that had caused their infections, meaning that if they were infected with another variant, these antibodies might not be as potent. In addition, the babies’ T cell responses, which in adults is responsible for protecting against serious disease, was somewhat muted as well. It’s not clear yet whether the other advantages of the infants’ response is enough to offset these other limitations. Still, the results of the study point to some intriguing new strategies for generating stronger, and longer-lasting immune responses to the COVID-19 virus. Scientists are currently developing nasal vaccines, for example, which rely on generating mucosal immunity, and in the case of COVID-19, that may produce more durable immunity than injected vaccines. “These infants may be teaching us a lesson that certain pathways to immunity can be triggered by nasal vaccines that mimic the response we see in babies,” says Pulendran. “If only we can make a vaccine that mimics these same pathways, then we might be onto something.”","['not found', 'not found']",us,False,False

The cryptoasset market has had a tumultuous time since many tokens reached all time highs during 2021, with the tumult hopefully ending with the ongoing trial of Bankman-Fried and FTX at large. Even with these headlines dominating the media conversation around cryptoassets, there is a very important trend that has surprisingly flown under the collective radar; the return of bitcoin dominance and leadership in the marketplace. To non-expert users and investors this might sound strange, as bitcoin dominates most every conversation connected to crypto, be they driven by either retail investors or institutional investors. The reality, however, has been different with many calls for the end of bitcoin dominance been repeated in various iterations. Forecasts following the Ethereum ETH upgrade tended to center around the seemingly unavoidable rise of the Ethereum community and Ether as the successor to bitcoin as the leader of the crypto community. Decreased power utilization of 99%, being the foundational layer for most Layer 2 applications including stablecoins, NFTs, and smart contracts, and trading at levels that make using ETH for purchases more palatable than spending BTC BTC all are strong arguments. In addition to ETH, stablecoins have also been heralded as the next leaders of the cryptoasset space, with recent entrants to this subsector including PayPal PYPL , a household name to many potential U.S. crypto users, as well as many international potential users. Despite that, bitcoin continues its reign as the most influential, largest, and most widely traded cryptoasset. Let’s take a look at what that might mean for crypto development as 2023 wraps up. Bitcoin Is An Asset Class The fact remains that even though bitcoin was originally created as a transactional medium the reality is that bitcoin is treated as an asset class, with over 50% of bitcoin having not moved for over a year. Coupled with the institutional desire to see bitcoin products approved and start trading reinforces the fact that bitcoin is increasingly viewed as an asset class, and that bitcoin continues to separate itself from the slew of other tokens projects that have flooded the marketplace in the last several years reinforces this trend. Implications of this are significant, and will have direct and indirect ramifications for the wider crypto space at large. Firstly, this all but assures that stablecoins will continue to make inroads as both a medium of exchange as well as how most institutions and entrepreneurs gain exposure to cryptoassets. This also means that options such as PYUSD, and the potential of state issued stablecoins (such as the Wyoming stable token project) will continue to play outsized roles in how implementation, perception, and cybersecurity around cryptoassets evolve. Bitcoin, both in perception and impact as how crypto is used on an everyday basis, will continue to drive headlines, but will take a backseat to TradFi driven projects. The Number of Tokens Will Drop Something that has been discussed quite a bit recently in the NFT NFT space, that 95% of the current marketplace might be worthless, is also something that can be applied more broadly to the cryptoasset space. Following the initial excitement around bitcoin in 2017, there was a deluge of token projects that were launched, with predictable results; scams of all kinds and other types of unethical activity have dominated headlines for years at this point. With the era of cheaper money coming to an abrupt close during 2022 this has only increased the pressure on marginal projects and tokens. Despite the nearly endless stream of bad news and negative headlines around crypto, including the detailed revelations around what happened at FTX, bitcoin has been surprisingly steady and increased its share of market dominance. As the crypto market continues to mature has to contend with both higher-for-longer interest rates and more competition from the TradFi space, and the potential of government backed tokens, investors will continue to look for value. Cryptoassets are financial instruments at the end of the day, and investors of all stripes will continue to look for assets that have fundamental value; bitcoin continues to satisfy that demand. Transparency Will Rise In Importance No matter the opinion of certain crypto advocates for a loosely regulated future the reality is that compliance, rules and standards will drive the health and sustainability of crypto going forward. Be it the rise of stablecoins issued by TradFi organizations, the multiple submissions for ETFs by large asset managers, or the launching of tokenized platforms by several of the largest banks in the U.S., the message is clear. Cryptoassets are here to stay, but there is not going to be room for the tens of thousands of tokens that currently exist to stay liquid. As large institutions of all kinds invest significant capital into developing these projects, and seek to recommend that clients do the same, the transparency and legitimacy of these products and services must beyond reproach. This means that reporting, disclosure, custody practices, and compliance must be at the forefront of cryptoassets moving forward. Bitcoin yet again seems to be fulfilling this role, with spot ETFs filed by trillion dollar asset managers focusing on bitcoin at the exclusion of all others. Bitcoin has long been the leader of the crypto market, and it’s continued dominance is good for both bitcoin investors and the crypto sector at large.","['us', 'us', 'unitedstates', 'not found', 'not found', 'not found']",us,True,False

AsHamas fighters crossed the border into Israel on Saturday, prompting Israeli forces to respond with air strikes on Gaza, social media had a clear function to play: Give people access to real-time, accurate information. This function is especially important when it involvesa complex conflict as historic, violent, and consequentialas that between Israel andHamas. Yet X in particular remains rife with misinformation and vitriol, even as owner Elon Musk pushes the platform asthe bastion of citizen journalism, where users post unfiltered, accurate reporting without involving professional journalists. Shayan Sardarizadeh, a journalist specializing in disinformation at BBC Monitoring,lamented how ""the deluge of false posts in the last two days""has been ""something else."" I've been fact-checking on Twitter for years, and there's always plenty of misinformation during major events.But the deluge of false posts in the last two days, many boosted via Twitter Blue, is something else.Neither fact-checkers nor Community Notes can keep up with this. Some of the worst offenders are those who pay for visibility and verification through Twitter Blue, now known as X Premium. Takethis post from Mario Nawfal, a verified user with almost 1 million followers. It purports to show a video of rockets ""fired by Hamas from the Gaza Strip towards Israel."" It's actuallyfootage from the Syrian Warposted online in 2020, per Sardarizadeh and a Community Notes response to the post.

Others are misleadingly repurposing content from other platforms. Avideo posted to TikTok in 2021 of a march in support of Palestinian rights in Chicagowas reposted to X with claims that the march was happening ""in Chicago now."" I’m seeing people I respect suggesting that there might be something inherent to Islam or to being a Muslim that lends itself to the massacres of the innocents by Hamas. This is profoundly and dangerously wrong. Most Muslims want what most Jews want and what I want. A good life. One reason might be perverse incentives. Since July, users signed up to the subscription service have beenpromised a financial cut of revenue generated from adsappearing among replies to their posts. That may be incentivizing posters to maximize engagement at the expense of truth. Elon Musk isn't helping. The billionaire directed his 159 million X followers to two social-media accounts thatpreviously posted fake news. When he first took over the platform almost a year ago, one of his first actions was to fire most of the staff who moderate for misinformation and harmful content. X is almost 20 years old, older than some of the media outlets covering the conflict right now. The vitriol and inaccurate information posted on the platform through the weekend show the site is far away from achieving Elon Musk's dream of disintermediated ""citizen journalism.""","['israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'not found', 'not found', 'morocco', 'unitedstates']",us,True,False

David Joyce, R-Ohio, as lawmakers convene to hold a third ballot to elect a speaker of the House on Friday.J. Scott Applewhite/APhide caption Rep. David Joyce, R-Ohio, as lawmakers convene to hold a third ballot to elect a speaker of the House on Friday. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who had been chosen Tuesday to be House Republicans' third nominee for speaker in as many weeks, told members hours later that he was dropping out of the race. Emmer, who currently serves as the House GOP whip, narrowly won the nomination on a secret ballot. But he faced the exact same challenges as the previous two speaker candidates and ousted Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Until a speaker is elected, the House is unable to move legislation on the floor to provide aid to Israel and Ukraine or fund the government past Nov. 17. Any candidate needs to win a vote on the House floor with the support of a majority of those voting and present to be elected speaker, or roughly 217 if all members are present. It was clear that Emmer could not convince a group of holdouts to back him. Emmer was selected after House Republicans completely restarted the nominating processes, three weeks after a vote to oust then-Speaker McCarthy threw the chamber into disarray. Majority Leader Steve Scalise and House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan were both named the party's nominee, but pulled their candidacies after they failed to secure enough support to succeed on the floor. Scalise withdrew before trying on the floor and Jordan failed on three ballots by the full House. Emmer's leadership position involves counting votes and convincing members to agree to back the party's position on legislation. He was seen as a potential frontrunner since he announced his plans to run, but faced resistance from conservative hardliners in the conference. For one, he's not as closely aligned with or embraced byformer President Donald Trumpas someone like Jordan was. He was one of only two speaker candidates in this round of voting — Rep. Austin Scott was the other — who voted tocertifythe 2020 election results. After the nomination vote, Republicans held a roll call to gauge Emmer's support. Lawmakers told NPR that about 20 members voted against Emmer's bid. Steve Womack, R-Ark., said he would ""enthusiastically"" support Emmer after opposing Jordan's nomination. But he said the conference remains a ""fractured lot,"" and was not convinced that Emmer could shore up the necessary support. ""What I just saw in that room illustrates to me that there are some people that are pretty well dug in and are not going to support the the current designee,"" Womack said. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., was more optimistic after the vote. He said Emmer was taking questions from holdouts and thought he was ""moving the room."" ""He's standing at the mic. People who have concerns are coming forward. And he's taking them on head to head — not in an adversarial way,"" Johnson told reporters. ""I think he's winning converts."" Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., voted against Emmer's nomination and told reporters he would do the same on the floor. ""I can't go along with putting one of the most moderate members of the entire Republican conference in the speaker's chair,"" Banks said. ""That betrays the conservative values that I came here to fight for."" In a potential blow to Emmer's candidacy, Trumpcalled him a ""RINO""on his social media platform, Truth Social, Tuesday afternoon. Trump, who said Monday he was ""trying to stay out of"" the speaker's race, wrote that Emmer ""is totally out-of-touch with Republican Voters,"" and supporting him would be a ""tragic mistake."" Trump ally Steve Bannon also attacked Emmeron his podcastTuesday, calling him ""essentially a Democrat."" Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., introduced aUnity Pledgeon Friday, urging his colleagues to ""put our differences aside and come together."" The pledge states that a member will support whoever becomes the party nominee when their nomination comes to the floor. That pledge did not seem to work when it came to Emmer. ""What we have now is a complete breakdown of what we've done for 200 years,""Flood told NPR's Morning Edition. ""The unity pledge simply says, we're going to support the candidate for speaker that wins the majority of the votes in our conference when we get to the floor. It's something we've done for 200 years. It's simple, but unfortunately, it's necessary.""

He had first heard about crowd trouble in Seoul’s nightlife district of Itaewon on evening news bulletins, but it was a call from his wife that made panic set in. Their 21-year-old daughter, Yujin, had set off to celebrate Halloween in Itaewon last Oct. 29 with a friend, who had phoned to tearfully explain that as the melee grew denser she had lost grip of Yujin’s hand and consciousness soon after. “After she woke, she had received a call from Yujin’s phone but there was no sound,” recalls Choi. “So she thought that maybe Yujin was injured.” Choi met Yujin’s friend in front of Seoul’s Hanyang University Hospital at 1:30 a.m. “There were lots of reporters and TV cameras,” Choi tells TIME, standing before an unofficial memorial outside Seoul City Hall for the 159 victims of the Itaewon crush. “There were dead bodies and a lot of confusion.” After hours of fruitless searching, Choi received a call from a policewoman asking if she was speaking to Yujin’s father. Then came that fated, hated word. “I just heard her say ‘unfortunately…’ and I don’t remember anything after that.” Choi was eventually reunited with Yujin in the morgue of a different hospital across the city. He spent the night weeping and stroking her hair. Yujin was a performance studies sophomore at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, though she had deferred her studies due to the pandemic, returning to South Korea where, with the grimmest of irony, she believed she’d be safe. “She loved writing, acting, and music,” says Choi, 54, a media executive. “She played the violin and was just a very positive, outgoing person.” No father should have to bury his only child, but Choi says the actions of South Korean authorities in the year since have only compounded his sense of grief and loss. Whileapologieshave been issued, nobody has taken responsibility for the disaster, which occurred when an estimated 100,000 revelers converged on a narrow, 45-meter alley that linked a high street metro station entrance with another street packed with bars and restaurants. “[Officials] try to make it the victims’ own fault,” says Choi. “If they didn’t go there, they wouldn’t have died.” It was the first virtually unrestricted Halloween festivities since the pandemic, yet only 137 police officers were on duty in the area—compared with 6,500 assigned to monitor a peaceful protest of around 25,000 people against the government of President Yoon Suk-yeol the same night. Just after 10 p.m., the crowds in Itaewon surged in different directions with people losing their footing on the alley’s incline, causing a domino effect and many to be trampled. Marking the first anniversary of the disaster, on Sunday, parents plan to march from Itaewon to City Hall to mourn together and to demand accountability from the local and central government. They are pushing for a special law to establish a special investigation committee to uncover the truth behind the Itaewon crush, believing that Yoon’s decision to allow the National Police Agency to investigate itself was flawed. The agency cleared its own top bosses and those at the central government of any wrongdoing. Cases against a dozen local police, fire, and other officials for offenses including negligence are ongoing. “Justice has not been quick,” says Sean O’Malley, a professor and political scientist at Dongseo University in Busan. “That’s very upsetting for parents who want some form of substantial change to safety procedures and how the government handles large scale events.” Political polarization has also muddled matters. The tragedy was seized upon by the opposition Democratic Party, which tried to elevate the tragedy to the national level and assign blame to the Yoon administration. Lawmakers voted to impeach Interior Minister Lee Sang-min for his alleged role in the disaster only for the decision to beoverturnedby the Constitutional Court. The furor fed a heightened climate of revenge politics, where any misstep by a rival party is seen as something to jump on, making officials more wary of taking responsibility, says O’Malley. “People were really upset that the opposition party had played politics with this tragedy.” In an interview with TIME, Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon said one of the causes of the disaster was that the alley was a “CCTV blindspot,” which has now been fixed with extra cameras. In the future, “we will incorporate AI into so-called people-counting CCTVs so they will automatically detect the number of people in crowds,” he says. “I firmly believe that such an accident will not occur again.” Oh’s use of “accident” is itself telling. The Yoon administration—Oh belongs to the same conservative party as the president—has instructed officials to use “accident” and “deceased” instead of “disaster” and “victims” when referring to the tragedy. For Choi, the shirking of official responsibility is bad enough—but the insidious descent into victim-blaming betrays a callousness that’s almost impossible to comprehend. Itaewon was spawned as a bawdy nightlife district adjacent to the U.S. military barracks, whose carousing GIs inevitably lent a reputation for sleaze and debauch. Though the barracks have long gone and Itaewon has since gentrified into some of Seoul’s priciest real estate, replete with cocktail bars and churrasco joints, an association with sybarites persists, especially amongst the older generation. When the crush occurred, city officials either overtly or obliquely began propagating the notion that the revelers themselves must have been at fault, having overindulged in drink or drugs or otherwise ignored the obvious danger signs. “They say they went there for ‘fun’—drinking, drugs,” Choi says. “It’s such a strange response. People didn’t get to hear how important, how brilliant, how shining these young people were.” The dodging of official responsibility is sadly all too common in South Korea, where politically appointed officials are protected by an entrenched hierarchical culture. In July, 14 peoplediedwhen over a dozen vehicles including a bus were swamped by a flash flood in a tunnel south of Seoul, despite warnings about the incoming bad weather for days. In August, the World Scout Jamboree had to be evacuated due to a heatwave, sewage spills, and flooded tents. In both cases, officials failed to heed warnings, but no political bigwigs faced censure. Instead, the imperative of the business and political classes is to move on. South Korea is aiming toattract30 million foreign visitors by 2027, capitalizing on a global K-Culture buzz that is sweeping the world, from pop sensationsBlackpinkto the Netflix hit showSquid Game. In this context, dwelling on the Itaewon crush is bad for business. Today, the site of the crush is marked by a purple notice board where well-wishers leave heartfelt notes in over a dozen languages. Meanwhile, outside City Hall, the small, makeshift shrine with photos of the mostly young victims, flower tributes, and somber classical music has been hit with escalating fines amounting to tens of thousands of dollars. “If they had consulted with the Seoul Metropolitan government before installing the shrine, it would not have been a problem,” shrugs Oh. “But according to Korean law it’s illegal that’s why we fine them.” This year’s Halloween celebrations will be a very subdued atmosphere with few decorations and fewer parties. Police have instructed Itaewon bars to keep their doors shut and not allow patrons to spill onto the street. Still, none of half-down business owners near the crush alley agreed to interviews when approached by TIME. “It’s not good for business,” one said. “We want to move on.” For Choi and the other relatives, it’s not that simple. For want of a proper investigation, Choi spends his spare time conducting his own by examining bodycam footage supplied unofficially by sympathetic lawmakers. He hopes to learn more about Yujin’s fate and a tragedy that his government appears desperate to forget. “Nothing has changed,” he says. “The same disasters happen again and again in Korea.”","['southkorea', 'southkorea', 'southkorea', 'southkorea', 'southkorea', 'southkorea', 'southkorea', 'southkorea', 'southkorea', 'southkorea', 'southkorea', 'southkorea', 'southkorea', 'china', 'us']",us,True,False

Butclimate changecould reverse this positive development. Heavy rainfall and dry periods change the chemodynamics of the river.The Panke is a small river that rises in the Barnim near Bernau and flows into the Spree in Berlin. Of its 29 kilometers of flow, 20 kilometers are on Berlin city territory. ""Stinky Panke"" it was called in the 19th century, when industry and growing settlements turned the river into a cesspool. But from the 1980s onward, the Panke steadily improved.""Panke 2015"" was the first joint project of the states of Berlin and Brandenburg to implement the EU Water Framework Directive. ""Since then, a lot has been invested in renaturation measures, but the Panke is and remains a highly urbanized river that is exposed to diverse human influences andenvironmental changes,"" said Dr. Christian Marx, researcher at TU Berlin who conducted the study as part of his doctorate.The research team evaluated more than 30 years of data on hydroclimate and more than 60 years of data on water quantity and quality of the Panke to find out how the effects of management measures and changing environmental conditions affected the river. The work ispublishedin the journalScience of the Total Environment.""Although the lower reaches of the catchment are still fed by the treated wastewater of about 700,000 people, and about 30% of the catchment is used for agriculture, the water quality in terms of nitrogen nutrients and phosphate is generally good to sufficient for an urban water body and has improved significantly over time at most sites,"" said Professor Dörthe Tetzlaff, Head of Department at IGB and co-author.The data show that this is a result of changes in management, restoration and more effective wastewater treatment. The general decrease in fertilizer use has also led to lower nitrate and ammonium pollution. These positive developments were particularly evident after management measures between 1985 and 2000, where investments led to an improvement in water quality from quality Class IV to Class II or better. With Class II status, the German target for meeting the chemical requirement of the European Water Framework Directive has also been achieved in the upper reaches.Ammonium and phosphate increase in dry periods, nitrate decreasesThe long-term data also show that water chemistry has deteriorated again due to hydroclimatic dynamics such as long dry periods, as in 2018, and heavy rainfall events, as in 2017. ""In general, the influence of hydroclimate on water quality increases with the degree of urbanization, from upstream to downstream. Hydroclimate also influences the function of water treatment inwastewater treatment plants. So, for a river like the Panke, which is largely fed by treated wastewater in dry periods, this can play a significant role,"" explained Marx.When precipitation is lacking in dry periods, pollutants enter wastewater treatment plants less diluted. Wastewater treatment plants with activated sludge treatment may benefit from lower volumes with longer retention times and higher biological activity during drought periods, but at the same time ammonium concentrations increase, suggesting inhibition of nitrification or a concentration effect. However, the increased ammonium concentrations are—at least so far—harmless due to the generally improved water quality and resilience.Concentrations for phosphate were highest during extremes: drought and long wet periods. This is due to altered hydrological connectivity and substance-specific flow pathways. Nitrate concentrations were lower during dry periods and higher during wet periods as a result of differences in the mobility and connectivity of agricultural soils to the stream network upstream in the catchment.However, impacts on water quality classes below Class II were not exceeded. ""These findings from the Panke catchment underline the importance of strategic adaptation and improvement of water treatment and water resource management to improve the quality of urban watercourses. They also show how important long-term, integrated data sets are. That is why we are also continuing our detailed process-based research and investigations on the Panke,"" concluded Tetzlaff.","['germany', 'germany', 'germany', 'germany', 'unitedstates', 'mexico']",gb,False,False

There are hopes the goal will be met this year.""Old promises must be kept, including the $100 billion pledge made over a decade ago,"" Jaber said on Sunday.Last year's COP27 talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, ended with the first ever creation of a ""loss and damage"" fund into which countries would pay to support poorer nations suffering the most from more intense and frequent storms, floods and droughts.The fund's operation, governance, location, contributors, beneficiaries and a timeline for payouts are all up in the air ahead of COP28.""We must make the fund for loss and damage that was promised in Sharm el-Sheikh a reality in Dubai,"" Jaber said.Climate 'crossroads'The talks in Riyadh are intended to ""shine a spotlight on challenges and solutions in a region that is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change,"" organizers said in a press release on Sunday.The region must already grapple with high temperatures andwater scarcity, with more than 60 percent of the population having ""very little if any access to potable water"", the statement said.""Increasing temperatures are predicted to lead to more persistent and acute drought,"" it added.Jaber also highlighted challenges facing the region, referring toextreme eventslike hurricane-strength Storm Daniel, which last month caused two dams in eastern Libya to burst and flood the city of Derna.""Climate change isn't a threat waiting around the corner—the MENA region knows this from first-hand experience with fierce heat waves and water shortages,"" said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme.Simon Stiell, executive secretary of UN Climate Change, said the region was ""at a crossroads, facing not only the devastating impacts ofclimate changebut also the challenge of transitioning their economies to ensure prosperity in a 1.5C aligned world.""The goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels was set at the 2015climate talksin Paris.","['unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'spain', 'saudiarabia', 'saudiarabia', 'saudiarabia', 'unitedkingdom', 'india', 'us', 'unitedstates', 'not found', 'not found', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'libya', 'libya', 'france']",gb,True,False

This is the conclusion reached by an international team of experts from Universität Hamburg's Cluster of Excellence for climate research (CLICCS) and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU). Their meta-study was released in the journalNature Climate Change.For their meta-study, the 30 authors analyzed more than 1,400 academic studies on climate change adaptation. By doing so, they offer the first global overview of which groups of actors are pursuing adaptation—and how.Their findings show that the global distribution of tasks lacks cohesion. Above all, there are few concepts designed to better prepare societies, infrastructures andrisk managementfor the impacts of climate change. Extensive collaborations between various government and non-government actors are also lacking.""Our study indicates thatclimate change adaptationcontinues to be largely isolated and uncoordinated,"" says Dr. Kerstin Jantke, a co-author and environmental researcher at Universität Hamburg's Cluster of Excellence CLICCS. ""That's disproportionate to how pressing and vital this challenge is.""Dr. Jan Petzold, the study's first author, sees a need for action. ""Comprehensive, just and forward-thinking adaptation can be considered to be successful when not only official organizations but also a broad range of groups at all levels are involved,"" said Petzold.Petzold, currently a geographer at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, was a member of the Cluster of Excellence CLICCS until the fall of 2021.To date, primarily individuals and households are taking measures to adapt to climate change impacts, especially in the Global South; very few of them are integrated into institutional frameworks. However, there is also an urban-rural divide. While individual households are largely active inrural areas, government actors tend to coordinate adaptation in cities.In many cases, the role of governments—global, national and regional—consists in ratifying, planning and financing adaptation measures, while small households are who do most of the technical implementation. According to the study, the scientific community's involvement in adaptation measures is limited, while that of the private economy is virtually non-existent.""If, around the globe, it's predominantly individuals like farmers and smallholders who are doing the heavy lifting, it also shows us the lack of cooperation between different groups of actors—which is a prerequisite for sustainable adaptation projects,"" says Jan Petzold. Coordinated concepts are indispensable for far-reaching measures like theclimate-aware restructuring of forests, transforming farmland into floodplains, planning new urban infrastructures, and relocating coastal communities.Involving different groups of actors can also help avoid undesired effects of adaptation measures. ""If I only design a given measure to address a single, pressing problem, it could make the situation worse in other areas,"" says Kerstin Jantke. For example, levees and dams designed to protect from flooding could destroy coastlines and wetlands, reducing biodiversity or natural CO2sinks.Consequently, comprehensive measures should ideally be oriented on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), helping ensure it offers solutions that are tenable in the long term.",[],gb,False,False

National security is no exception. TheNational Intelligence Council has foundthat ""climate change will increasingly exacerbate risks to U.S. national security interests as the physical impacts increase and geopolitical tensions mount about how to respond to the challenge.""The U.S. Defense Department recognizes that climate change is a ""threat multiplier"" as it exacerbates existing environmental stresses andsecurity risks. In a2021 Department of Defensereport, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that almost everything the U.S. Defense Department (DOD) does to defend the American people is jeopardized by climate change—the department's strategies, plans, capabilities, missions, and equipment—and the risks are growing, especially since the world is not on track to meet its Paris Agreement goals. The risks lie not only within U.S. borders; our partner countries impacted by climate change affect American national security interests as well, he said.Jason Bordoff, director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, goes further. ""DOD and the wider national security community need to broaden their definition of 'climate risk,'"" he said. ""There's been plenty of analysis conducted on the exposure and risk to military infrastructure from rising sea level, storms, etc., but there will also be less direct impacts of climate change, such as competition over critical minerals or political instability in resource-rich nations as fossil fuel use eventually dwindles.""Here is a look at the national security challenges posed by climate change.Direct threatsInfrastructureSea-level rise andextreme weatherare affecting both the military's infrastructure and its supply chains. Installations and facilities near coasts are eroding and flooding.In 2013, Fort Irwin in California experienced flash flooding that cost over $65 million in damages. In Virginia, the Norfolk Naval Station, the world's largest naval base, experiences routine flooding during rainstorms and high tides. This impacts the Navy's ability to conduct operations in the Atlantic Ocean, and hampers its work on ships and submarines in the shipyard. U.S.military baseson Guam and the Marshall Islands are also vulnerable tosea-level rise. Damage from 2018's Hurricane Michael shut down Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida for months; rebuilding it was estimated to cost $3.6 billion. Rising temperatures and extreme precipitation at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri can prevent stealth nuclear bombers from taking off.Global supply chains are also disrupted by extreme weather, which may hinder the military's ability to access critical supplies. Technology sectors such as artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, and semiconductors are essential to U.S. national security. But in 2021, severe flooding in Malaysia, a major hub for semiconductor assembly and packaging, disrupted the supply chain, contributing to a global semiconductor shortage.Extreme weather makes outdoor training and military exercises difficult and can affect the maintenance and effectiveness of weapons systems and other equipment. This means existing and new equipment will need to be redesigned to enable it to operate in all climate conditions. Weather conditions can also limit the amount of land available for training and reduce water supplies. Heat waves and other extreme weather can decrease personnel productivity and impact military members' health.Demand for military resourcesThe physical impacts of climate change increase the frequency, scale, and complexity of defense operations and make them more costly.Because natural disasters are increasing, the military is being called on more frequently as first responders for disaster and humanitarian relief and must respond to situations beyond their usual scope. For example, between 2016 and 2021, the number of National Guard personnel days spent fighting wildfires increased by 162,000 as droughts have lengthened fire seasons. During Hurricane Sandy, the DOD helped distribute 6.2 million meals, 7.8 million gallons of fuel, medical supplies, and other staples.Indirect threatsDisplacement and civil unrestClimate change also affects food and water security, degrades the environment, increases the spread of diseases, and disrupts essential services like electricity production. These impacts can drive migration. One study found that if we continue our fossil fuel use trajectory, the probability of multiple simultaneous droughts could increase from the late 20th century average by 40 percent by 2050 and 60 percent by late century.These droughts could potentially affect 120 million people around the world, triggering crop failures, threatening water supplies, and forcing people to migrate. The World Bank has warned that 143 million people particularly in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America could end up migrating due to climate impacts.As migrants enter countries or regions unprepared to deal with them, tensions rise. As we already see on the U.S. southern border, migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Venezuela, and other nations fleeing poverty, violence, and extreme weather are causing enormous political turmoil.Climate impacts contribute to poverty, social inequality, political instability, and violence. Weak governments have trouble meeting their people's basic needs, so civil unrest increases. These conditions can lead to shifts in the regional balance of power or result in the failure of states. In some of these cases, the U.S. military may be called upon to come to the aid of its partners to restore stability.Joshua Fisher, director of the Advanced Consortium on Cooperation, Conflict, and Complexity at Columbia Climate School, said that most of the conflicts he sees in the world are not directly driven by climate change.""What climate change is doing is impacting already vulnerable societies,"" he said. ""So if there are tensions, if there are large sectors of the population who are marginalized, by and large those same sectors of society are going to be impacted disproportionately by climate change. This opens up a mechanism where climate change can further marginalize and harm already vulnerable people. And that can be the mechanism that leads to increased conflict.""Conflicts around decarbonizationAccording to aNational Intelligence Council report, tensions are also likely to grow as countries argue about how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Paris Agreement goals. The conflict will be about which countries bear more responsibility to act and to pay, due to their historic emissions.""As pressure to decarbonize increases, you can expect more animosity between the developed and developing worlds as poorer countries wonder, rightly so, why the richer countries, who have created the climate crisis in the first place, are now asking them to limit their consumption of fossil fuels,"" said Bordoff.Developing countries will continue to demand more money from developed countries, which have failed to mobilize the promised $100 billion a year by 2020. The UN estimates that developing countries will need at least $300 billion per year by 2030 just for adaptation. Meanwhile, countries that rely on fossil fuels to support their economies see theenergy transitionas a threat and are attempting to slow progress towards decarbonization.""The pressure of the energy transition may, if not managed carefully, increase geopolitical tensions, creating new risks to energy security,"" said Bordoff. ""Many of these tensions will be seen in who is wielding influence in the emerging clean energy economy, and who the winners and losers are in a shrinking fossil fuel economy.""Competition for resourcesEfforts to achieve decarbonization will hasten the race to secure resources. For instance, as countries try to reduce their own vulnerability by becoming greener and more energy self-sufficient, the demand for rare minerals for batteries and solar panels will increase. According to Bordoff, to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, the demand for critical minerals will go up sixfold. Competition between countries to acquire and process the minerals needed for renewable energy technologies could result in conflict.""One example of this is a recent rift in the U.S.-E.U. relationship, where we've seen historical allies at odds over perceived unfair protectionism in new clean energy investments,"" said Bordoff. ""Another is the heightened tensions between China and the West with regards to critical minerals, batteries, orsolar panels, with Western leaders concerned about China's dominance over the production of clean energy and the potential weaponization of this market dominance. The longer the world takes to get to net zero, the worse these problems will get.""The ArcticThe melting Arctic ice is opening up the Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.This could lead tocompetitionfor sea lanes for commercial shipping between the United States, Russia, China, and Canada. Countries are also vying for the region's unclaimed land, fish, natural gas, minerals, and other resources.Most legal matters in the region are determined by the Arctic Council, which is made up of the United States, Russia, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. Other countries, such as China, Germany, and India, are considered observer countries. Because the Arctic Council's resolutions are nonbinding, however, it has no enforcement power. Consequently, as military and commercial activity in the region grows, so too could the risk of miscalculation and conflict.GeoengineeringThe U.S. intelligence community is alsoincreasingly concernedabout geoengineering, which is now being discussed more often as a viable option for dealing with climate change. This is particularly the case with solar geoengineering, which involves sending reflective sulfur dioxide particles into the atmosphere to reflect solar radiation away from Earth and imitate the cooling effect of a volcanic eruption.Research on geoengineering is being done around the world, particularly in the United States, China, and India. As there is currently no international governance for geoengineering, it's conceivable that in the future, a single country suffering from climate impacts could decide to conduct geoengineering on its own. This could cause weather patterns around the world to shift, disrupt monsoons, degrade the ozone layer, or trigger droughts that affect agriculture; it could also be weaponized. This could exacerbate tensions between countries or even lead to war.What the military is doingIt is now DOD policy to consider climate change in all its operations, activities, business processes, decision making, and resource allocation to ensure that military forces continue to be capable and effective.The DOD isinvesting $3.6 billionto enhance the resilience of its infrastructure, improve its energy and water capacities, and modernize its operations.This includes funding for microgrids, energy storage, and renewable energy, electric vehicles, and charging installations. $106 million will be used to improve the energy efficiency of operations. $1.3 billion will be invested into research and development in cutting-edge technology and prototypes of new conveyances. $54 million will go toward incorporating climate impacts into war games and exercises to ensure that the military can operate in all conditions.""In a warming climate, you're going to see rising seas threaten critical infrastructure, growing geopolitical tensions, larger flows of migration away from the most climate-vulnerable nations, civil conflict driven by resource scarcity, and new venues for conflict,"" said Bordoff. ""Each one of these by themselves would be worrying, but having them play out simultaneously will cause not only a drain on limited resources to counteract them, but will exacerbate today's worsening geopolitical trends.""He added, ""Military leaders need to devote more attention to some of these more complex consequences of climate change so that they can better prepare for them.""The DOD is one of the only organizations in the world with the ability to move materials anywhere around the world in 24 hours, according to Fisher. ""And so understanding the national security interest we have in preventing conflicts from escalating into outright violence should be one of the DOD's priorities,"" he said.The DOD should look at areas that are vulnerable toclimatechange, as well as at near- and mid-term forecasts for risks in various regions. ""They should utilize the resources they have to prevent conflict, not with military action, but rather by supporting rule of law programs or emergency support, or providing provisions, to try to prevent conflicts from escalating.""Fisher has been impressed with the DOD's handling of the topic ofclimate change. ""The DOD has been able to be frank and sober about it, but understand that it is anational securitythreat, and treat it as such, rather than getting mired in the politics of it,"" he said. ""The more they can maintain that focus, the better I think they'll be.""Provided by State of the PlanetThis story is republished courtesy of Earth Institute, Columbia Universityhttp://blogs.ei.columbia.edu.Citation: Why climate change is a national security risk (2023, October 11) retrieved 3 November 2023 ","['us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'marshallislands', 'malaysia', 'guatemala', 'elsalvador', 'honduras', 'mexico', 'venezuela', 'china', 'china', 'china', 'china', 'china', 'russia', 'russia', 'canada', 'canada', 'finland', 'sweden', 'denmark', 'norway', 'iceland', 'germany', 'india', 'india']",gb,False,False

Record flooding in and around Houston produced ""mini extinctions"" of insects and other species in areas that remained inundated for 10 or more days.Study lead author Mattheau Comerford, Egan and co-authors Scott Carroll and Tatum La discovered evolution played out across space rather than time when the insect species Jadera haematoloma recolonized flooded areas.Comerford, a former graduate student in Egan's lab, is now a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Carroll is a biologist at the University of California, Davis, and La is a Stanford University undergraduate and former high school intern in Egan's research group.The researchers showed that in the wake of the storm, a form of evolution called spatial sorting exerted a greater influence on the evolution of J. haematoloma, commonly known as the red-shouldered soapberry bug, than did natural selection.Red-shouldered soapberry bugs . Credit: Mattheau Comerford""This is an understudied and underappreciated form of evolutionary change that has emerged from the invasive species literature,"" Egan said of spatial sorting. ""For example, cane toads in Australia have exhibited these patterns. And up until the last decade or two, spatial sorting has not really been considered a significant form of evolutionary change.""Natural selection and spatial sorting each change the likelihood that specific traits will be passed to future generations. With natural selection, change plays out over decades or even millennia as traits become more common or less common depending on which individuals survive and reproduce. With spatial sorting, change occurs when species move into new territory, and traits become more common or less common depending on which individuals are at the leading edge of range expansion.""If everybody is moving at different rates, the ones that move the fastest will always tend to end up at a higher density at the range edge,"" Egan said. ""So right at that range edge, you have just a subpopulation of the fastest dispersers. And when they mate, there's a tendency for them to have even faster dispersing offspring. So there's this kind of accumulative, increasing rate of dispersal as the range front moves outward.""Prior to Harvey, Comerford spent about 10 months gathering field data about soapberry bugs at 15 sites around the Houston metropolitan area. Native to Texas and the southwestern United States, the bugs are a textbook example of rapid evolution. They feed on seeds by plunging needle-like beaks deep into the fruit of their host plants.When the goldenrain tree was widely introduced in the United States as an ornamental plant after World War II, it proved an opportune host for soapberry bugs. The trees' seeds are not as deep as those of the soapberry's native host plants, and the bugs rapidly evolved shorter beaks to access them. Through decades of study, Carroll and others have shown this is one of the fastest recorded examples of ecological adaptation.Southeast Texas is one of the few places in the United States where short-beaked soapberry bugs coexist alongside two native varieties with longer beaks that are adapted to the seed depths of their host plants.Credit: Mattheau ComerfordAt field sites, Comerford sampled soapberry bugs from the three host plants every two weeks. Prior to the storm, the bugs found on each host were the varieties whose beaks were adapted to match the host's seeds. This was expected, given the ""extremely strong selective pressure to rapidly adapt beak length to suit the seed pods of whatever host plant they are living on,"" he said.Harvey flooded 11 of the research team's 15 sites. At non-flooded sites, the three varieties of soapberry bugs continued to thrive. At flooded sites, Comerford found soapberry bugs began returning within three months, but only bugs with longer wings reached these sites. It took more than two years for all the sites to be recolonized by the long-winged bugs.""Looking at our data and past publications, we saw that beak length and wing length were genetically linked, meaning insects with longer wings also had longer beaks,"" Comerford said. ""So now that we had better dispersers driving spatial sorting, they were dragging along these other traits, the longer beaks, that had nothing to do with dispersal.""The persistence of long-winged, long-beaked individuals on all of the host plants at the recolonized sites showed ""spatial sorting was having an effect that was much stronger than the effect of natural selection in that moment,"" Comerford said. ""That is completely novel in this experiment.""Egan said the study demonstrates the significance of spatial sorting, because similar scenarios could play out after many types of climate catastrophes, including wildfires, droughts, heat waves and winter storms.""All these episodic types of events are predicted to increase in frequency and magnitude in the coming years,"" Egan said. ""As populations move in response to these events, and as they are moving poleward to get into the envelope to which they are adapted, they're going to be subject to spatial sorting.""Comerford said, ""The hallmark of the Anthropocene, and all of the changes that we're seeing with the environment, is that the ability to move and migrate to new locations that are more hospitable is critical for the survival of organisms. This study shows there is a force out there that we haven't been accounting for that could make a huge difference in the survival and evolutionary change of organisms on the move. We need to be cognizant of its potential, because this is a phenomenon that is probably going to come into play more as events unfold.""","['us', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'ireland', 'ireland', 'ireland', 'ireland', 'la', 'australia', 'italy']",gb,False,False

We often do not involve women in respondingto environmental problems. To often, we exclude them in discussions on solutions to climate crisis.Patriarchal culture also creates unequal gender relations, with women being considered only capable of managing household and domestic work.Leaving women out when coming up with environmental solutions puts them in more vulnerable positions.Whenclimate change-related events occurs—such as more extreme weather,forest firesor floods—women and girls bear aheavier burdenand experience more severe impacts.Violence against womenis also on the rise amid global warming.However, we need to changethe narrativethat women are merely ""victims"" of climate crisis.In reality, women in the Global South countries also possess the abilities and strength toprotect the environment. They manifest their power to preserve the environment in various actions, both formal and informal, individual and collective.Women's movements across the Global SouthHistorically, women have played a big part in protecting the environment in Asian and South American countries.One example is theChipko movement in Indiain the 1970s.The Chipko movement started in 1974, when the Indigenous women and community of Reni village in India fought to protect the forest from logging that threatened their livelihood. They collectively took action by guarding and embracing trees to push back contractors and prevent deforestation.Their fight went global,making waves worldwide.Duringthe 1985 Nairobi Conferenceon Women from Third World Countries, women emphasized the importance of nature conservation and women's environmental actions. Testimonies from the Chipko movement and similar women's movements in other countries were discussed at this conference.Fighting for change in Mexico and BoliviaBesides the Chipko movement, there is a recent example from women in Zapotalito, a village within the Chacahua-Pastoría lagoon national park area in southern Mexico.They have endured a series of environmental challenges, includingdead fish, a dreadful ammonia smell, and a decline in air and water quality due to adam project and lime oil factory pollution.The women of Zapotalito worked together toclean the natural canal in the Coaxaca mangrove area. They used shovels and hoes for regular clean-ups in 2016.Even as they fought for change, they continued their daily routines. They cooked food, made tortillas, cleaned houses, cared for children, tended to pets and plants and caught fish for their families to eat, even amid bad environmental conditions.On another front, the women's movementin Chiquiacá, Bolivia,has been protecting the Tariquía Flora and Fauna National Reserve since 2017 from oil and gas companies' expansion into their precious area.In a bold move in 2019, they actually blocked the entrance to the conservation area for a whopping five months to prevent drilling equipment from being brought in.Chiquiacá women in action in Bolivia.The women of Chiquiacá also took their protest to the streets, actively hindering any development on their land. What began as a local movement has grown into a powerful collective action that's still going strong today. It's gained the support of thousands of people in Bolivia.Indonesian fisherwomen's leadershipIn Indonesia, fisherwomen in Central Java have been working to sustain their community amidstthe climate change since 2020. Rising sea levels have increased flood risks in their neighborhoods, forcing them to take action by engaging with policymakers, raising awareness and fundraising to build bridges.Unfortunately, women in these movements often face threats, intimidation and violence. Their enemies tried to undermine their action, by saying ""women should stay silent at home and take care of the kitchen"" Some of them receiveddeath threats.Despite these challenges, however, they continue their fight to protect their land.Growing global recognitionThe stories above have shown women are capable of making a difference in environmental activism, from their homes and communities to the national stage.The global community increasingly recognizes their efforts too. Since the 1990s, more international policies haveemphasized genderas acrucial elementin nature conservation and sustainable development.For example, the 1992Rio Declaration on Environment and Developmentacknowledges the vital role of women in environmental management and development.The Beijing Platform for Action, established in 1995, is a resolution that supports gender equality and empowerment of women worldwide.The reportsof the High-Level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Beijing Platform for Action in Asia and the Pacific highlight the critical link between environmental change and women's roles as managers and providers of natural resources.There's also the 2004United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which emphasizes the crucial role of women in drought-affected areas, particularly in rural regions of developing countries.Recent documents fromthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)highlight the pivotal role of local women's movements and Indigenous women in shaping climate policies and actions.Numerous policies also promote women's participation in the sustainable development agenda.But, not all countries adopt those policies.Better solutions through involving womenDespite being disproportionately affected by environmental damages, women continue to demonstrate their resilience and knowledge in tackling climate change.To empower women's activism, governments worldwide should formulate policies integrating women's roles in conservation and sustainable development strategies within their own nations.As for the public, initiating efforts to document women's activism is crucial.Both government and public actions are essential to avoid oversimplifying women's experiences across diverse countries, and to move beyond the narrative that portrays them solely as victims.These actions are fundamental in steering clear of oversimplifying the experiences ofwomenacross diverse countries. They are also the first steps towards solvingenvironmental problemsinnew and better ways.","['not found', 'not found', 'india', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'ecuador', 'bolivia', 'bolivia', 'bolivia', 'indonesia']",gb,False,False

That’s precisely what Vanport 1948 is going for, thanks to a callback to a historic time in the City of Portland’s history. Yes, Vanport elegantly honors the past, but it’s also forward-looking in design and flavor and through its exceptionally modern artwork on the label. It’s vodka, but delicious and with an incredible backstory, one that you’re going to want to read about no less. Steeped in a rich history of culture, Vanport hearkens back to when the City of Portland was barely a twinkle in anyone’s eye. Specifically, as the name implies, Vanport. As the second largest city in Oregon back in 1948, it featured the largest housing development in the country, an offset of its mass production at the time and complement to its busy portland-area shipyards. Around the height of the war, earlier in 1944, about 40,000 people lived in Vanport, including up to 10,000 African Americans. But on Memorial Day in 1948, the Columbia River flooded, pouring over a nearby dike and dumping about fifteen-foot swells downstream right into the city of Vanport. At least 15 people lost their lives, and over 18,000 residents were left homeless because of the disaster. The disaster significantly strained the residents and race relations in the area and further impacted an ongoing housing crisis amidst a rapidly rising local population. Today, Vanport 1948 stands as a representation of that history, and also its exceptional vodka. Taste the Spirit Born out of respect for those affected by the 1948 Vanport flood, the brand borrows from the strength of the original city, which eventually grew to become the heart of the City of Portland. The survivors gave birth to the current generation and those who have created this brand. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, Vanport honors the passionate people “who seek a spirit of joy and celebration of life, happiness, and love of the City of Roses.” The history may have been disastrous, but there’s a remarkable future ahead, both for the people of Portland and the Vanport 1948 brand. Integral to that is Vanport’s blend of spirits, all distilled within the City of Portland and to an unprecedented standard. At the forefront is Vanport’s Vodka, a high-quality, consistent, smooth, and delightful blend that instills the local spirit of Oregon and the City of Portland, including those from the original bustling Vanport hub. It’s a testament to the community’s rebirth after such a tragic event, but most importantly, that the culture, spirit, and dedication of the people did not get washed away with the waters of the flood. Today, Vanport 1948 emphasizes sustainable delivery, working with a network of local distillers who take great pride in their craft. Bottled entirely in Portland and distributed by the country’s first eco-friendly distributor, you can enjoy the spirits guilt-free. Vanport has also prioritized environmental care in its operations, purchasing over 300,000 pounds of carbon offsets across projects from the local Oregon forest to Guatemala and South American nature hubs. Quality is the utmost concern for the Vanport team and is the first and last tenet they honor. All spirits from the brand must have a strong body, exceptional taste, and a smooth palatable experience. Simple yet wonderfully-tasting that sets the bar high and stands far and above the competition. We’ve tried it, and we assure you, it’s phenomenal. Born of tragedy, inspiring greatness, and delivering an unmatched product are all staples of the Vanport 1948 brand, so much so that its claim to be “the spirit of rising” couldn’t be more accurate. Like the people of Vanport, now integrated into the heart of Portland and directly responsible for the city’s founding and immense growth, this is a proud tale. It has its ups and downs, but it also offers a remarkable spark of light and hope, a lightning rod of innovation, just like the social innovation and success of the original community. If you’re only here for a sip, give it a try. You won’t be disappointed. But maybe stick around a bit to learn about its past and future — Vanport 1948 symbolizes evolution and innovation.

But seismic events can have other causes, including floods and even large crowds of excited fans—such as those at Taylor Swift's recent Seattle shows, whose enthusiastic reception caused seismic activity equivalent to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake—and glaciers.Decades ago, scientists who research seismic activity in the Washington Cascades recorded a number of smallseismic eventsand eventually determined that they were caused by glacier movement. These events, called ""glacier quakes,"" allow for important insight into seismic activity, patterns of glacier movement and even climate events.For Washington state residents,seismic activityis nothing new. Washington is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc along the edge of the Pacific Ocean where tectonic plate interactions frequently lead to more earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.In 1980, Mount St. Helens erupted in southern Washington, killing 57 people and causing the most disastrous volcanic eruption in US history. Washington also falls within the Cascadia Subduction Zone, where a fault line between the Juan de Fuca Plate and North American Plate threatens a 9.0 magnitude or more earthquake in the coming century.In the Washington Cascades, glaciers are another frequent culprit of quakes. According to Seth Moran, a research seismologist at the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory, when seismologists firstset up seismometers on Mount Rainier decades ago, they were nervous when they saw small quakes reminiscent of the ones that preceded the eruption of Mount St. Helens. ""However, we were eventually able to improve tracking and clearly determine that these quakes were coming from glaciers, not volcanic activity,"" Moran told GlacierHub.Using seismometers, researchers identified similar glacier quakes on Mount St. Helens and Mount Baker in the following years, and these have continued to the present day, primarily occurring in thesummer months, ""because glaciers are moving more in warmer months, so we're seeing more of the internal crackling then,"" said Moran.Washington glaciers are not alone in triggering these glacier quakes. The Alaska Earthquake Centerdetectsbetween 1,500 and 2,000 glacial quakes per year—some comparable to magnitude 3 earthquakes. Most of these occur in Southcentral Alaska, and these quakes follow the same seasonal pattern as the Washington glacier quakes.Similarly, manynational parksand hiking sites have had growing numbers of visitors following anationwide spikein outdoor recreation and theend of COVID travel restrictionsover the past few years. More visitors means more people in areas where they might be able to feel some of these quakes, leading torecent media coverageof the glacier quakes.But how exactly do glaciers cause these earthquakes?Jackie Caplan-Auerbach, a professor of geology at Western Washington University, located just west of Mount Baker, told GlacierHub that ""anything that shakes the ground can be recorded by seismometers."" For instance, glacier lake outburst floods, which occur when water builds up behind a glacier dam until the pressure becomes so intense that it bursts through, also createseismic vibrationsdue to the large volume of water suddenly rushing downstream.In the case of glacier quakes in the Cascades, likely causes includecrevasse formation—which occurs when the lower part of a glacier moves more quickly than the upper part, spreading the ice until a gash forms—and stick-slip behavior at the glacier ice-rock interface. Caplan-Auerbach elaborated, ""As the ice flows, it gets stuck on underlying material and eventually slips forward once the stresses build up to a certain point. That slip is what we record as a tinyquake."" In Alaska,calving of tidewater glacierscan also cause glacier quakes.While these glacier quakes have all been detected on volcanoes, that doesn't mean the phenomenon occurs only on glaciated volcanic mountains. ""We're likely seeing these events at these volcanoes because they have large glaciers and/or they are heavily instrumented with lots of nearby seismometers,"" said Caplan-Auerbach.The combination of these two factors has led groups that track quakes, such as thePacific Northwest Seismic Network, to show high numbers of quakes around Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier—where there are several seismometers that can pick up even small quakes—and much fewer around Mount Baker, where there is only one seismometer, at Glacier Peak.As demonstrated by the Alaskanglaciers, many of which were not on volcanoes, these glacier quakes can be measured in most places where there is a large glacier and a seismometer to track movement.Moran notes that the activity on Mount Rainier was especially interesting to researchers at first. After they determined that the small, repetitious quakes were not a sign of impending eruption like at Mount St. Helens, they were able to establish, in the late 2000s, that the glacier quakes were connected tostorm systemsin the area. Moran explained that these storms ""were putting [rain]water into the glacier and allowing it to slip more readily for a short time,"" which increased the frequency of the quakes.Another interesting glacier quake that researchers are still puzzling over is a repeating quake coming from the Easton Glacier on Mount Baker. Not only has this quake occurred every day in the same spot for the past 15 to 20 years during quake season, it is also much stronger than other glacier quakes in the area, measuring around magnitude 2 on the Richter Scale.""The waveform [of this quake] is identical from event to event, which is unusual for an environment like a glacier where you'd be expecting a lot of change,"" Moran said. ""This [identical waveform] means the quake is happening in the exact same place and nothing has changed—the ice is the same thickness and the rock is the same composition."" This quake is likely the result of a stick-slip behavior of the glacier, but researchers are still eager to learn more about it.Some of these glacier quakes are too small for people in the area to feel, but others, like the repeating Easton Glacier terminus quake, has been recorded on seismometers out to 100 kilometers away, said Moran. Mauri Pelto, a professor of environmental science at Nichols College and science director of the North Cascades Glacier Climate Project, told GlacierHub that his team of researchers and artists felt the small glacier quakes almost every day during their annual field season in the North Cascades.Pelto has studied the Easton Glacier for the past 40 years and seensignificant terminus retreat, meaning that the identical waveform glacier quakes must be occurring somewhere on the ice-rock interface other than at the terminus.While these glacier quakes are of interest to researchers, they pose little to no threat to tourists and surrounding communities. John Mutter, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at Columbia University, told GlacierHub that few researchers focus on this topic for that precise reason. ""One important motivation for studying earthquakes is that they cause damage and deaths. Glacier quakes do not,"" Mutter said.Although there was initial concern when these quakes were first spotted on seismometers decades ago, seismologists have clearly defined the difference in volcanic activity and glacier activity and these relativelysmall quakesare too small to trigger volcanic events.As technologies and access to these areas improve, the data we have will follow suit, allowing seismologists and climatologists to have a better understanding of glacier movement and the overlap of climate patterns and ice flow.Provided by State of the PlanetCitation: Washington's volcanoes are experiencing seismic tremors from an unlikely source—glaciers (2023, October 23) retrieved 3 November 2023 ","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'not found']",gb,False,False

""Ballon Pour,"" Ireland team mate Louise Quinn commented under the post, a reference to McCabe, like many others, missing the Ballon d'Or ceremony on Monday despite her nomination. McCabe scored a hat-trick when these two sides met in Dublin last Friday as Ireland romped to a 5-1 win, but it was a whole different ball game in Albania, and water polo would probably have been more appropriate.

The surface soon suffered with the ball constantly stuck under players' feet, and any attempt at a pass along the ground rarely reached its target. The game was scoreless at halftime and play was suspended for an hour as ground staff cleared the waterlogged pitch. Their efforts paid off as the second half finally got underway in more playable conditions. Denise O'Sullivan scored the winner in the 88th minute, and with four wins from four games, Ireland have secured the group win and promotion with two games still to play.

Powerful winds and rain are already lashing southern England and gusts of up to 95mph (152km/h) are expected to hit the Channel Islands. The Met Office has warned of travel disruption and damage to buildings, prompting the declaration of a major incident in Hampshire. There are also 33 flood warnings in place across England. A red wind warning, the highest level, has been issued by Jersey Met for Wednesday night into Thursday. Storm-force gusts, heavy rainfall and coastal flooding are expected in the Channel Islands, where conditions could be some of the worst seen in decades and flood defence measures have been put in place. Yellow and amber warnings for wind and rain - indicating potential risks to life and property - have been issued by the Met Office for parts of England and Scotland. An amber warning of wind has been issued for South West England from 03:00 GMT to 11:00 on Thursday, and for the East of England and the South East from 06:00 to 17:00 on Thursday. Heavy rain was pushing into parts of Cornwall and Devon on Wednesday evening. The Met Office said there was some uncertainty around the path of the storm, but the ""greatest impacts (are) likely along the south coast"". The Met Office says the UK has provisionally recorded the joint-sixth wettest October on record, after the heavy rain brought by Storm Babet. Eastern Scotland had its wettest October since records began in 1836, with 82% more rain than its average. Gusts are likely to reach 70-80mph (113-129 km/h) in some coastal areas in southern England, and in a few coastal spots may exceed 85mph (123 km/h). And20-30mm of rain is expected in southern and western areas. Other key developments include: The power of the storm is created by a phenomenon known as explosive cyclogenesis - sometimes dubbed a ""bomb cyclone"" - where an area of low pressure rapidly deepens and strengthens, causing the weather system to violently rotate. The amber warnings for wind could cause structural damage, the Met Office warned. It said gusts could blow off roofs, bring down powerlines and disrupt transport routes. Flying debris could be a danger to life, it said, and there is the potential for large waves and beach material being thrown onto coastal roads. There are also yellow warnings for rain for eastern England, London, the South East, South West, North West, West Midlands and Wales from 18:00 on Wednesday. And yellow warnings for wind are in place for the East of England, London, South East, South West and Wales from 21:00 on Wednesday to 23:59 on Thursday. In Scotland, a yellow warning for rain has been issued for the south west and Lothian Borders from 06:00 Thursday to 06:00 Friday. An earlier warning for rain in Northern Ireland has been cancelled but the region has already seen some flooding. East Devon District Council said a temporary barrier of sand and a fabric membrane were being put in place to reduce the impact of waves from the storm. With trees still in full leaf and the ground already saturated, Devon County Council said there was a high chance that there would be a lot of debris on the roads and a risk of highway flooding. It said it would have additional staff monitoring the highways, as well as tree surgeons and gully jetters on standby to keep drains and gullies as clear as possible. Storm Ciarán follows localised weather-related incidents last weekend when large waves brought down coastal barriers in North Tyneside and homes were evacuated and shops were damaged when a village in County Durham was deluged by ""several feet of water"". In West Sussex on Sunday, a caravan park in Bognor Regis was submerged, the town's Tesco supermarket car park was flooded, and the roof of a house was ripped off in heavy winds that residents described as like a ""tornado"". Experts say a warming atmosphere increases the chance of intense rainfall and storms. However, many factors contribute to extreme weather and it takes time for scientists to calculate how much impact climate change has had on particular events - if any. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

With expectations that 2023 will be the hottest year on record, regions across the planet have been scorched by deadly heat waves. Others have been hit by floods, or in some cases, have suffered both extremes in quick succession. ""The truth is that we are shocked by the ferocity of the extreme weather events in 2023. We are afraid of the uncharted territory that we have now entered,"" said an international coalition of authors in a new report published in the journal BioScience. Their stark assessment: ""Life on planet Earth is under siege"". They said humanity had made ""minimal progress"" in curbing its planet-heating emissions, with major greenhouse gases at record levels, and subsidies for fossil fuels soaring last year. The damning assessment comes just a month ahead of UN COP28 climate negotiations to be held in oil-rich United Arab Emirates. ""We must shift our perspective on the climate emergency from being just an isolated environmental issue to a systemic, existential threat,"" the authors said. The study on the state of the climate looked at recent data on 35 planetary ""vital signs"" and found 20 of these were at record extremes this year. Just roughly 1.2 degrees Celsius of temperature rise above pre-industrial levels has triggered a range of calamitous and costly consequences. This year has also seen the beginning of a warming El Nino weather phenomenon. The European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service has said that the three months to September were the hottest period ever recorded, and likely the hottest in approximately 120,000 years. Many climate-related records were broken by ""enormous margins"" in 2023, the report said, particularly temperatures in the oceans, which have absorbed almost all the excess heat caused by human carbon pollution. Co-author Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said recorded sea surface temperatures ""go completely off the chart"" and scientists are not yet able to fully explain why. The potentially serious impacts include threats to sea life and coral reefs and an increase in the intensity of large tropical storms, the report said. People across the planet have faced heatwaves and droughts this year, while severe flooding has struck in the US, China and India and beyond. In Canada, record wildfires partly related to climate change released more carbon dioxide than the country's total 2021 greenhouse gas emissions, the report said. Before 2023, days with global average temperatures more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels were a rarity, the authors said. This year had already registered 38 such days by mid-September. The more ambitious Paris Agreement target of 1.5C will be measured over decades. But lead author William Ripple, professor at Oregon State University, said we are likely entering a period where annual temperatures will reach that level or higher, risking danger from climate feedback loops and tipping points. ""Once crossed, these tipping points could change our climate in ways that may be difficult or impossible to reverse,"" he told AFP. These could include the meltdown of the ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica, thawing of large areas of permafrost and widespread coral reef die back. With some tipping points ""we're not going to avoid them now, it's more about slowing the damage"", said co-author Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter To do that, emissions must be slashed and temperature rise curbed. Every fraction of a degree matters, Lenton told AFP: ""There's still a lot to play for."" That includes the number of people who might face intolerable conditions in coming decades, like severe heat, limited food availability and climate extremes. The report said three to six billion people could be ""confined beyond the livable region"" by century's end. ""Many world leaders have generally continued to support business as usual, rather than enacting policies to curb climate change and sustain life on Earth,"" said Ripple.

Abandoned mines account for much of this area.It'sestimatedthe US has about 500,000 abandoned mines and Canada at least 10,000. The UK and China have at least 1,500 and 12,000 old coalmines, respectively.Abandoned mines can pose extremeenvironmental, health and safety risks. Unreclaimed coalmines, for example,continue to emit greenhouse gases.Land is a scarce resource. Restoration enables sustainable and dynamic use of former mining land. It opens up golden opportunities—environmental, social and economic.Environmental benefits:Carbon farmingMine leases generally lock up vast land areas. This land presents a commercially viable, yet neglected, opportunity for carbon farming.For example,replanting abandoned leasescould earn carbon credits under the Australian government'sCarbon Farming Initiative. It can help ""hard to abate"" industries such asminingmove towards net zero emissions.Sustainable and renewable energyAbandoned mines can also be used to produce and storerenewable energy. Examples range from providing sites for solar farms toGreen Gravity's energy storage technology.Green Gravity uses a system of weights in a mine shaft to store energy from renewable sources. This energy is used to raise the weights. The energy can later be released when the weights are lowered under the pull of gravity.Another example is the former Kidston gold mine'spumped storage hydro project. This system uses twowater reservoirsin former open pits. Renewable energy is used to pump water into the higher reservoir. Releasing this water into the lower reservoir generates hydropower energy as needed.For abandoned deeper mines, tapping into geothermal energy could even make it viable to resume mining.Water securityAbandoned mines or quarry pits canstore large amounts of drinking, harvested and recycled water. This will help increase water security, especially when located near urban areas or industry corridors.Disaster preventionAnother option is renaturalisation. This depends heavily, though, on location and mine type.For example,Indonesia has plansto restore forest on former mine sites to help reduce floods. These reforested areas will help retain floodwaters.The former Kidston gold mine in Queensland has a new life as a pumped hydro energy storage plant.Biodiversity restorationNature-based approaches to mine rehabilitation include reforestation and phytoremediation, which uses plants to clean up contaminated environments. These approaches tackle mines' legacy of pollution and add ecological value.Restored land allows for native species to be reintroduced. It can also provide bridges between patches of habitat to enhance biodiversity. In Victoria, this has been done with a former quarry atRoyal Botanic Gardens Cranbourne.Social benefits:Improving urban liveabilityRenaturalised mines can be valuable communal and green spaces. Particularly when done inurban areas, it can provide residents with better air quality, microclimates and quality of life as these sites support recreational and cultural activities.All Nations Parkis another example of a quarry restoration just seven kilometers from the Melbourne CBD.Education and tourism opportunitiesRestored mining land opens upeducational, architecturalandtourismopportunities. These range from hotels such as theInterContinental Shanghai Wonderland—most of it is underground— to eco-tourism and education centers, such asthe Eden Projectin the UK.Economic benefits:Critical mineralsCritical minerals are vital for batteries, electric vehicles and electrification needs. These minerals can be extracted from inactive mines and tailings storages.Mine waste processing couldcontribute billions of dollarsa year to the economy and support regional jobs.Job creationSeveral large regions in Australia, including the Pilbara and Bowen Basins, face similar rehabilitation challenges. But each company is responsible for its own mine closure and rehabilitation. Current mining business models are not well suited for rehabilitation.However, the scale of the rehabilitation work required in a major mining region would support an entire regional industry. It could provide many local jobs after mines close.There are synergies between the many uses of restored mine sites. For example, Royal Botanic Gardens Cranbourne not only restores biodiversity, but has also created an attractive space for people to gather, along with jobs and education opportunities.So what are the obstacles?A mine's rehabilitation costs may total hundreds of millions of dollars. These costs are often many times greater than what governments hold in rehabilitation bonds, which operators must provide asfinancial securitybefore mining begins. Nevertheless, the financial and environmentalconsequences of inaction dwarf such costs.Globally, the costs of mine rehabilitation and closure liabilities run into billions of dollars. However, investments ingreen infrastructure have reached trillions of dollars. Some of these funds could be directed into rehabilitation and clean-up efforts, with the benefits of:providing capital to ""kick off"" and refine the collaborative work needed to deliver multiple benefits—as well as mining companies, this work involves many other organizations and individualscreating clear financial accountability for rehabilitationgenerating business opportunities and sites for testing new sustainability practices and developing ""gold standards"" for restoring and repurposing mine sites.A co-operative investment approach enables all partners to understand their shared responsibilities before any long-term expenses affect them individually.Strong governance, initial funding and collaborative development are needed to achieve environmental, social and economic outcomes that add value to mine rehabilitation.","['australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'us', 'canada', 'uk', 'china', 'china', 'indonesia']",gb,False,False

This year, they're evacuating because of fire. Over Victoria's long weekend, campers and residents in Gippsland had toflee fast-moving fires, driven by high winds.The megafires of the 2019–2020 Black Summer came off the back of an earlier El Niño climate cycle. Now, after three years of rain and floods, El Niño is arriving on Australian shores again. With it comes fire weather—hot, dry and windy.The question is—are we ready?Last week, emergency management minister Murray Watt moved to reassure an anxious country. ""Australia is much better prepared for this season than we were heading into Black Summer,"" he said,speaking aftera national summit ondisaster preparedness.Yes, authorities are better prepared. But by and large, we as individuals are not. Far too often, Australians think it's the job of the authorities to be ready, which breeds a false sense of security.This fire season may pack a punchThe Black Summer bushfires of the 2019–20 summer were a stark reminder of how fire prone Australia is. But they were more than that—they were not normal. Around 20% of all of our forests went up in flame.2019 was thehottest and driestyear on record for Australia. But 2023may break that record, as climate records topple around the world and extreme weather events multiply. This year is likely to be the hottest on record globally, and next year the recordmay well fall again.Sustained rain from three successive La Niña years has driven widespread vegetation growth across Australia's 125 million hectares of forest, bush and grasslands. Over the coming weeks, many areas could dry out quickly and become tinder for bushfires.Climate cycles do give us time to prepareAustralia's wet-dry climate cycles have one benefit—during wet years, fire authorities get a reprieve. That lets governments,emergency servicesand the communitycoordinate, plan and prepareforbushfireseasons ahead.That's why Minister Watt can accurately claim Australia is better prepared. The capacity and capability of our emergency services to predict the spread of fires and issue timely warnings to communities is better than it has ever been. In planning and preparedness fornatural hazardssuch as bushfires and floods, we have seenbetter integrationbetween government, emergency services, civil and private sector organizations.Planned burning is still a challenge. It's tough to find the right weather conditions to burn off fuel loads at low intensity, without risking the blaze spreading or threatening property.But these burns are done much morestrategically these days. Rather than simply aim to hit a target of hectares burned, authorities are now focused on burning fuel in areas where it could endanger lives and damage critical infrastructure during bushfire season.These advances give us good reason for confidence. But not for complacency.Every bushfire is unique. And our fires are, by and large,getting worse. It would be an error to think our investment insmoke-detecting algorithms and satellite monitoringand the development of the newAustralian Fire Danger Rating Systemwill spare Australia from the loss of life, property andenvironmental destructionobserved during the Black Summer fires.Why? Decades of bushfires have shown even the best preparation can be found wanting on days of severe bushfire danger when firestorms can develop quickly and behave unpredictably.For Australia to be ready, you need to be readyWhile megafires happen—and draw the most headlines—most bushfires are local rather than national events.That means we must prepare at a local level.If you're faced with a bushfire threat, you have onlytwo options.You can stay and defend your property—as long as you are physically and mentally prepared, have adequate firefighting resources, and your property is prepared and defensible.Or you can leave early, which means making a judgment call about the best time to go in a calm manner. That doesn't mean panic—if there is time, it can be possible to do things like clear fuels from around the home and dampen the surrounds to give your house a better chance of surviving undefended.Which should you choose? It depends, in part, on where you live and your personal circumstances. Remember too that most Australians will never experience a bushfire firsthand.Every community has a different risk profile and people and communities vary considerably in their levels of preparedness and planning.If a fire does start and head towards your house, you could be taken entirely by surprise if you have no bushfire plan.To be clear, this is arguably the largest gap in Australia's fire preparedness.Planning is easy, if done aheadThe question of whether Australia is ready for the fire season should be reframed. The better question is: are Australians ready?The good news is, it's easier than you think to make a fire plan. As a household, it might take just 10 minutes. Your state or territory government has a website showing you how:VictoriaNew South WalesQueenslandSouth AustraliaWestern AustraliaAustralian Capital TerritoryNorthern TerritoryTasmaniaWhy plan ahead? Because it is vastly better to have a clear plan at your fingertips rather than frantically trying to figure out where your loved ones are, whether it's too late to leave and whether you could realistically fight the fire—when the fire is on your doorstep. Faced by the reality offire, many of us can freeze.What firefighters want us to learn is that the critical decisions and actions which save lives and property in a bushfire are taken by us and our communities, not by politicians or agencies.","['australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia']",gb,False,False

In J… [+12597 chars]",Benin,"Edo State Commissioner for Roads and Bridges, Ethan Uzamere, talks to ADEYINKA ADEDIPE about the dilapidated state of federal roads, flooding in the state and the government’s intervention plansIn July, the convoy of the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, got stuck in one of the failed sections of the Benin-Sapele Road, a situation he described as scandalous. Is the state ready to fix the road or waiting for the Federal Government under whose jurisdiction it falls?Firstly, all the federal roads leading to Edo are in bad shape. It is not about some failing but it is all of them. The way federal roads and state roads are constructed is different. Federal roads take heavier vehicles and they are constructed to meet that demand. The state has continued to do palliative work on the roads. For example, we worked on the Benin-Lagos Road earlier in the year after lives were lost on the road. We are currently partnering with the Federal Government on the Sapele Road and we are also in the process of doing some palliative works on the Benin-Agbor Road. A lot of our local roads have suffered because of the bad state of the Benin-Auchi Road which leads to the northern part of the country.However, we are working to make sure that those roads are strong enough to withstand the rigours of the heavy vehicles passing through them.When we approached the Federal Government to do the Benin-Sapele Road a few years ago, we were denied the opportunity and we stepped back. It stopped us a few times from undertaking the job. But we are currently working with the Minister for Works, David Umahi, to see how the roads can be fixed despite the palliative that we are doing. He has seen the pains we go through as a state because the issue of roads affects every citizen of the state and that is the reason we are doing palliative work on the roads while waiting for the Federal Government’s major rehabilitation.You talked about not being allowed to work on the road previously. What were the reasons given by the Federal Government?We were stopped from working on the federal roads, especially the Benin-Sapele Road. We were told to stay off the federal roads and it was prominent in the news.What action has the state taken to see that work is done on these roads after the minister’s visit?One of the strategies we use is to engage the contractors working on the roads. The roads had been awarded to contractors long ago. We told the minister that one of the reasons we are having issues is that our (Edo) roads are now being used more frequently. The minister is an engineer and he understands our plight. He is also a former governor and he understands how people want projects done. Everyone knows there is a difference between federal and state roads but the roads are essential and everybody needs to move. That’s why the states needed to do all those palliative works.The minister was quoted as saying that the state could get in touch if it wanted to fix the affected federal roads and get a refund from the Federal Government later. Has the state explored that avenue?I am sure the minister said this before he came for the inspection, but he has also seen that a better job needs to be done in road construction. The technical know-how must improve. He has agreed that a new method should be employed in the construction of the roads, especially for high-impact roads. He has said that concrete technology must be used. The way those roads are being constructed now, they won’t last three years after they are commissioned. It is like wasting the money given to the contractors who have had the job for years, some for more than five to six years. Edo is a transit state, everyone goes through the state and our roads suffer from the impacts of heavy vehicles that are using our roads as an alternative to the bad federal roads. That is why we are where we are today.Before now, people thought that the administration of Godwin Obaseki would have fixed the road just as a former governor, Adams Oshiomhole, did, which made the state get over N16bn as a refund. Why has Obaseki not done the same?I would believe that this avenue would have been explored before my time. I also know that a few years ago, the Federal Government stopped that arrangement. For example, the repair of the Sapele Road is financed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited but it is still a Federal Government road. It will be a big financial burden on the state the way they are specified.Do you think the poor state of the economy can also be a reason for the state not taking up the repair of bad federal roads within Edo?The economy plays a little role but we have a lot of our roads that are not being attended to at the moment. We also have our roads to invest in. We are also looking at mechanisms that will help take erosion off our roads so that they can last longer. There is a lot of infrastructural development the state has to do for itself so we have to strike a balance to know the things we have to invest in which means that we have to make very strong decisions. Edo has three senatorial districts and all the roads must be attended to. People tend to think about Benin City alone but there are roads in villages and districts all across the state. Every district needs attention and that is why we took over the repairs of the Benin-Abraka Road.Some of the inner roads are failing a few months after construction. What is your ministry doing to fix them?Since I assumed office a few months ago, we have strengthened the inspection of roads but the bigger issue is the erosion problem. The question is: Why do the roads fail? One of the major reasons is flooding which makes water stagnant on roads. So, this administration wants to ensure that this problem is fixed before embarking on road construction. What I will say is that a good percentage of the contractors are good but must also follow the specifications given to them by the state. So, the ministry is also increasing its scooping for future road constructions, visiting the ones that are damaged, and the contractors will go back and fix them.Related NewsProtesting workers shut Edo assemblyTravellers, motorists stranded as protest rocks Edo over bad roadNDLEA arrests 252 suspected drug traffickers, others in EdoThe GRA in Benin City is noted for not having a good drainage system to prevent flooding when it rains. Why is it difficult for the state government to address this?It is obvious that is why the roads have failed. There is nowhere to take the water. It is part of the policy work we are pushing in the ministry. We are also going to create some temporary water collection sites. Constructing drainages in an area that is already developed could be more expensive than building roads. The non-construction of drainage is a foundational issue. The government of the state led by Governor Obaseki has come up with a developmental plan that will ensure that drainages are constructed in new areas and a water control mechanism is available. Before now, people just went into communities, acquired land, and opened up the place by building houses with no plan. That was why I said there are lots of foundational issues. We are doing a lot in our Edo State master plan to address those issues. I know it is difficult for the people at this time but we all know the problem and the stormwater plan is being expanded to take more areas and even build drainage to preserve existing roads.The Edo State Government flagged off the construction of over 200 inner roads last year. Why has the project slowed down? Or what are the challenges?The challenge has to do with the weather. We have been having a lot of rain this year. We just started having some dry spells and the contractors will go back to the roads. We have found out in the last few months that there are serious flood issues that need to be addressed before jobs can be done.Can you mention some of the areas?In the GRA, we have the Adeyan area which collects a lot of water. We have places around Sapele and Sakponba roads. A lot of the problems come up due to the way people build their houses higher than the roads. The Ministry of Physical Planning has done a lot of work and is partnering with our ministry to identify and tackle a lot of these issues. Now when getting your plan approved, the ministry is concerned about how the construction of your building affects the roads.I know that the Ministry of Physical Planning has updated a lot of its policies in the last few years to avoid problems like this. I know they have demolished houses that obstructed the roads and before you get your building plan now, our staff members seconded to that ministry will go with the inspection team. A lot of things have been built on mistakes and to correct them is a lot of work, but we are up to the task.Repairing roads is beyond filling failed portions with gravel. If you put gravel and it rains, it makes the road worse. Road construction is very technical and that is why palliative measures are not encouraged at times because you have to follow up quickly with measures to make sure the road is good for a long time. That will be looked into and we will see what we can do about it.Who do you think is to blame for the suffering experienced by Edo residents owing to the decay of all federal roads in the state?Since we brought the minister in to inspect the roads, he has been sensitive to our plight in Edo. We are in contact with him and we are pushing his ministry to do major work on these roads, especially the Benin-Agbor Road. We have done palliative works on the Benin-Lagos Road, and the Benin Sapele Road and we are reconstructing the Benin-Abraka Road. Some of those federal roads are under a concession and we need to know if the companies will be able to fix these roads. The thing about road construction and maintenance is that the people responsible are hidden. The public needs to know who has jurisdiction on the roads but we know that the Edo people suffer from the bad state of these roads.The Benin-Auchi road has been under construction for years. Is that something to worry about?I am happy you pointed this out and that is what we are also working with the Federal Ministry of Works. We also agreed on the methods used for road construction, considering the high-impact road that we need to build with concrete technology. We need to replace the laterite with sharp sand. The contractors tell you they can’t work during the rainy season because they use laterite. Introducing sharp sand means that they can work all year round. In the southern part of the country, contractors work heavily for four to five months but they stop working because of the rain. We are bringing in technology that will enable us to do more roads during the rainy season.What has been the high point for you since you assumed office as Commissioner for Roads and Bridges?The high point for me is that I work with intelligent people who you need to direct on how the job should be done. I also hope there could be alternative sources of funding contracts because there must be finance to construct roads. The contractors are also business people and they can’t be in debt. I am also passionate about creating a policy on how the ministry can move forward. With a strong policy, you create a strong institution and with a strong institution, we will be able to achieve better things for the people.We want the Federal Government to continue to support us. We are still pushing for the reclassification of the roads. It is also important to reassess the contractors. They need to account for the money they have collected because there are no results to show for money collected. We need to be honest with ourselves. We are all suffering from the bad state of these roads. They need to step up the way they monitor the construction of these roads just like we do. We are looking forward to our continuous collaboration. I am also telling Edo people that the contractors in charge of inner roads will move back to the site now that we are getting some dry spells.Do you think allocating more funds to states will help them solve the problem?The Federal Government also needs to begin the process of decentralising powers. As of today, we don’t even know how they determined the amount allocated to states. A lot of things go out from this state but what we get back is minimal. I was in the Ministry of Mining and Energy before I came to (the Ministry of) Roads and Bridges. For a state that has a high level of onshore gas, gold, and lithium, when you see what comes back to the state, it is not commensurate with what is taken out and this is not fair. The states should be more involved in what they get as allocation. We should be able to audit the process. With what we have, the state can be independent and we can provide amenities for our people.

In contrast, he condemned the short lifecycles of roads across Nigeria. The average lifespan of roads across Nigeria is five to seven years.He stated that the use of asphalt by some contractors is a source of funds depletion for the government and any contractor who is not ready to work with the concrete technology will have no jobs offered to them by the ministry.Concrete roadsCement technology, also known as “Rigid Pavement Technology” is a type of highway surface made by blending cement, sand, coarse aggregate, and water to form a mixture that is poured and compacted to form a durable, long-lasting surface.This is followed by a concrete reinforcement cast with 8mm to10mm-high tensil (mash of wires) reinforcement bars over the stabilised base before the option of treating it with prime coat and asphaltic concrete.Though the cost of this technology is highly debated compared to conventional construction methods, experts acknowledge that this method is better because it strengthens the load-bearing capacity of roads. Cement technology is one of the technologies used in the construction of airport runways, tarmac and places with heavy loads like machines and equipment.Findings by our correspondent showed that in foreign countries, cement concrete roads are the fundamental type of arterials. Their share reaches 50 per cent in some European countries and 60 per cent in the United States of America, Germany and Norway while no other European country has as much as concrete roads being built as Poland.As of 2022, the total length of federal government roads was 36,000 kilometres. Roads in asphaltic concrete made up around 24,000 kilometres of the total network, some 5,800 kilometres were made of gravel or earth while 6,000 kilometres were surface-dressed roads.TechnologyWhile experts don’t argue the benefits of the new technology, leading road construction companies bear the brunt of this decision. Industry experts who confided in our correspondent said the current situation is tough for all stakeholders considering the tough business environment.According to them, construction companies have invested several millions of dollars in asphalt technology equipment and also imported bitumen and other raw materials running into billions of naira, adding that shifting to concrete technology at the current stages of the road projects will lead to millions of dollars in losses.Officials also said the development would lead to new investments in equipment for the construction of roads with concrete technology, commencement of importation of cement due to the lack of domestic capacity to produce cement for roads and other building projects in Nigeria.According to them, it will also lead to an increase in demand for forex for the importation of cement and steel and iron rods which will put more pressure on the naira, while also noting that it will lead to an increase in the cost of construction of road per kilometre.Alleging a breach of contracts that could lead to huge losses on the part of the government, contractors are further bewildered that with the upsurge in the price of construction materials, the new directive has made it difficult to re-tender documents for variation of contracts.According to a source familiar with the issue, contractors are very agitated over the issue as a result of the potential abandonment of equipment. The source stated that in the face of the current economic crunch, no contractors have the pool of funds to buy the concrete paver machine needed for this type of road, which currently costs 1.7 million euros or N1.7 billion in local currency.The source said, “It is difficult to raise new funds to buy a concrete paver machine needed for this type of road. A unit of this machine currently costs 1.7m euros which is over N1.7bn in local currency and contractors are asking if the government is going to lend them money or support to buy the equipment needed. Contractors are business people but this kind of business is a big business and you can’t just change policy all of a sudden.“You have to provide support for them and that is why they get advances sometimes. The contractors combine engineering with business and if a contractor knows that if he works and submits his invoice, he won’t be paid for six months, he has to provide for it with the money he would borrow from banks with interest rates and the rest. The current situation is tough because many of them borrowed money to do the job.”Another source stated that the ministry may begin selective treatment of contractors who possess the right equipment for concrete, leaving the rest out in the cold to juggle contracts with state governments or other sectors.Way forwardCommenting on the issue, engineering experts advocated the continued usage of both asphalt and concrete road design so as to allow a seamless dive into the preferred technology the minister wants, without business casualty.An engineer, Akaninyene Ikopbo, who spoke in a telephone interview said, “It is a good thing to put forward technology but its introduction has its own pros and cons. Currently, there are some roads in Lagos that are being concreted which is good.“But the basic thing is everything is based on costs and there must be no compromise because that can spoil the job. Most of our roads are bad because we compromise whether on asphalt or concrete.“If you want to continue the use of asphalt, your drainage must be right because water is the greatest enemy of asphalt roads. Though you can tolerate that on concrete with time, it can’t be guaranteed. Our drainage must be right and well taken care of.“There are many factors to consider before switching to concrete but the biggest question is, are we ready to do the needful? We have to encourage both, we have bitumen for asphalt likewise cement for concrete, so there is no one that is good enough. The country is importing bitumen because we are our own problem and until we make up our minds to do the right thing, things won’t change.“Part of the problem that may occur with concrete roads is the steel. It has to be imported as we don’t have steel in Nigeria which is a factor of dollar on our economy. We may have policies without having a holistic view of how the economy will affect our project. We have to go back to the basics and start doing things right,”Ikopbo recommended.On his part, a civil engineer and member of the Nigerian Society of Engineers, Ijirotimi Olarenwaju advised the government to consider making legislation to make concrete the only lawful method of road construction.He said, “I think the Ministry of Work is in the best position to explain why. All I know is that there may be justification for all they are trying to do.“You will notice that they are not thinking of using concrete roads in the northern part of the country. They are only thinking of it in the southern part because water has a major effect on asphalt roads especially the foundation of the road which is the laterite. Once this absolves water and you subject the road to loading, it fails quickly so maybe that is why they are thinking of putting these concrete roads or a combination of both concrete and asphalt, which is better.“That is what they do in Europe though it is because of their weather. Also, they have done their research on it and that’s why it’s more popular over there. I expect the ministry to start working with the national assembly to put in legislation to support the move just like Russia did in 2017.” The insistence of the Minister of Works, Dave Umahi, to introduce reinforced concrete pavement roads, dumping the more popular asphalt road, has led to an abrupt stop of ongoing road projects in the country.Findings show that contractors have either slowed down on construction works of ongoing projects or have left work sites owing to different reasons ranging from the unforeseen change in policy, lack of funds and a potential redesign of roads and pavements as directed by the minister.Some of the ongoing federal highway projects that have slowed in work pace are the Abuja-Lokoja Road, Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano, East-West Road, Enugu-Port-Harcourt, Benin-Warri Road and Akure-Ado-Ekiti Road due to the redesign of pavements, concerns on flood-prone areas and other important infrastructure.The list also includes Zaria-Funtua-Sokoto-Shema Road in Kaduna State and some parts in Gusau in Zamfara State, Mubi-Maiduguri and Bama-Konduga-Maiduguri Road in Adamawa and Borno states.Right after his ministerial screening on August 1, 2023, at which he was asked to take a bow per Order 52 of the Senate Standing Orders, the minister announced his intent to build roads using concrete technology.Umahi, in an interview with journalists, advocated concrete-constructed solutions which, he said, would last 50 years, as opposed to asphalt roads that last seven years.

For example, South Africa, with a population of 56 million, boasts of a homeownership rate of 67.7 per cent.In contrast, even smaller countries like the Benin Republic, with a population of 11.8 million (about half of Lagos State’s population), have a homeownership level of 61 per cent. Libya, with a population of 6.8 million as of 2019, maintains a rate of 41 per cent. Meanwhile, larger nations like Brazil, the USA, Kenya, and Singapore enjoy substantially higher homeownership rates of 63 per cent, 70 per cent, 73 per cent, and 90 per cent, respectively.Frequent reports issued by the National Bureau of Statistics; consistently depict a trajectory of growth or decline, hinting at the state of the housing component within the sector. The report signals improvement, stagnation or depreciation.Real estate/construction market growthIn Q3 of 2022, the NBS released a report underscoring the substantial impact of the construction and real estate sectors on the GDP during the first three quarters of 2022. According to the report, the construction services sector generated a remarkable N12.9tn in revenue, while the real estate sector contributed an additional N7tn, resulting in a combined total of N20tn added to the GDP.Further insights from the report indicated that the real estate services sector witnessed a nominal growth rate of 9.13 per cent during this period, surpassing the growth rate observed in the same period in 2021 by 0.50 per cent. However, it was 3.68 per cent lower compared to the preceding quarter.The real estate sector’s journey to positive growth began in the last quarter of 2020, marking its recovery from a recession that persisted for six consecutive quarters. This recovery followed the last positive growth rate of 0.93 per cent recorded in Q1 2019.Nevertheless, despite this positive momentum, the housing segment of the sector continues to grapple with a widening deficit of over 28 million housing units.According to the latest data released by the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics recently, the sector contributed a total of N8.33tn in the quarter compared to the N9tn generated in the fourth quarter of 2022.The NBS attributed the decline to the adverse effects of the cash crunch experienced during the quarter.A breakdown analysis showed that the real growth rate of the construction sector reduced by 1.56 per cent points from the rate recorded in the previous year.The NBS, however, noted the sector contributed 11.79 per cent to nominal GDP in the first quarter of 2023, higher than the 9.68 per cent it contributed a year earlier and higher than the 10.16 per cent contributed to the fourth quarter of 2022.Despite all these, the homeownership level remains low, and experts have identified a number of factors responsible for this disparity or mismatch.InflationTo tame the accelerating inflation rate in the country, the Central Bank of Nigeria has hiked the interest rate from 11.5 per in April 2022 to 18.75 per cent in July this year. The rate persists till now. The increase in benchmark interest rate has been taking its toll on the country’s economy, worsening its housing crisis. It has also made investors take a watch-and-see approach as the prices of buildings continue to skyrocket.“Inflation which is the reason for the high building material prices and labour costs is at the root of the problem we have at hand,” Johnson Chukwuma, a construction engineer, said, explaining that GDP figures were not necessarily based on increased output, but rather on increased costs.The recent surge in building material prices has dealt a blow to the dreams of many prospective homeowners, dashing their hopes for lower construction costs.Between January 2022 and August 2023, the prices witnessed a staggering increase of over 70 per cent, making it increasingly challenging for individuals to afford their desired homes.This has been attributed to soaring inflation in the country.The Consumer Price Index report, which measures the rate of change in prices of goods and services from the National Bureau of Statistics showed a slight increase in the inflation rate, soaring to 25.8 per cent as of August 2023.The chairman, Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria, Lagos Chapter, Bamidele Onalaja, said besides inflation, the real estate sector is also challenged by the high interest rate and volatile exchange rate of the naira against other currencies.He said, “Presently, all the factors that drive an increase in commodity prices in Nigeria, including galloping inflation, volatile foreign exchange rate and cost of transporting goods from one point to another, have all contributed to challenges confronting the real estate sector.”He added that the Exchange rate in the country, which is dwindling and increasing daily, is a huge source of worry. This is a given that Nigeria is a country where over 70 per cent of building materials are imported.High mortgage rateThe Association of Housing Corporations of Nigeria had earlier decried Nigeria’s low homeownership rate, saying the country ranked lowest at 25 per cent, especially when compared to Brazil (74 per cent), Kenya (75 per cent), South Africa (70 per cent) and Indonesia (84 per cent).Speaking on the occasion of this year’s World Habitat Day with the theme ‘Mind the Gap: Leave No One and Place Behind,’ the President of the Association of Housing Corporation in Nigeria, Dr. Victor Onukwugha, said it was sad that at 63, Nigeria was still beset with confusion about how to develop the housing sector.Related NewsFHA mortgage bank disburses N10.6bn to 962 beneficiaries – MDMortgage bank posts N847m profitInterest rate: Mortgage bank posts N847.1m profitHe said, “Inappropriate mortgage systems that still depend largely on outright sale of houses that are out of the reach of the pocket of the people who really need them; lack of housing finance, among others, are some of the challenges plaguing the housing sector.“A crawling mortgage market without a vibrant platform that would create unhindered access to affordable mortgages, as well as exit points for developers who invested in housing and inappropriate land administration that could offer acceptable access to appropriate and viable real estate transactions were crippling the sector, “ he added.In the same vein, a real estate expert, Timothy Gbadeyan, said the high interest rate and low wages were among the major factors making it difficult for most Nigerians to access a mortgage to own a house.He said, “Accessing a mortgage in Nigeria is at an interest rate of around 17 per cent or in some rare cases 16 per cent. If the bank wants to give you N14m and your salary is N120,000 in a state capital like Osogbo for instance. From that N120,000, your mortgage payment should not exceed N40,000. What kind of property will you be buying that N40,000 will be able to service your principal plus interest within a period of 10 years? So, when you look at a commercial mortgage, it is outside the reach of the masses.”In an exclusive interview withThe PUNCH, the Chief Executive Officer of Fame Oyster & Co, Femi Oyedele, noted that the CBN’s persistent interest rate hikes had adversely affected the mortgage market.He said, “The Central Bank of Nigeria’s persistent hike in interest rates has impacted the mortgage market. This is because the mortgage market is majorly dependent on commercial banks’ interest rates. Project costs of real estate are rising daily, posing challenges for both lenders and borrowers alike due to high uncertainties. This is one of the reasons Nigeria cannot attract foreign investors despite our huge infrastructure deficit, which the World Economic Forum Global Infrastructure Table of 2022 put Nigeria at 123 positions out of 186 countries surveyed.”FloodingIn recent times, the communities of Anguwan Rogo, Rikkos, Bauchi Road, and Naraguta in Jos North Local Government of Plateau State were struck by a devastating flood. This calamity was the consequence of heavy rainfall occurring on both Saturday and Sunday afternoons, resulting in the destruction of a minimum of 150 houses and substantial property damage.Experts have approximated that properties located in flood-prone areas have experienced a decline in value of approximately 10 per cent. They argued that properties situated within floodplains significantly lose their value compared to similar homes in flood-safe areas within the same vicinity.Apeh Phillips, the Chairman of the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers in Kogi State, emphasised that the impact of flooding on property sales had been significant.“Even after the floodwaters recede, rental values remain low because people are hesitant to reside in areas where the constant threat of flooding looms. Prospective buyers are also cautious, leading to difficulties in selling properties in these flood-prone regions.”Recently, officials from the National Emergency Management Agency revealed that at least 11 states, including Adamawa, Taraba, Benue, Nasarawa, Kogi, Anambra, Edo, Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, and Cross River, are at risk of experiencing adverse effects from the opening of dams. They advised residents in these areas to evacuate to prevent harm to human lives and valuable assets.Building collapseAs per the latest findings released by the Building Collapse Prevention Guild, Nigeria has recorded a total of 553 building collapses spanning from 1974 until April 13, 2023.This unsettling trend has played a role in the persistently low rates of home ownership in the nation.The report indicated that Lagos State had recorded a high collapse with over 326 buildings caving in the last 49 years.It showed that 326 collapsed buildings in Lagos represented 59.05 per cent of a total of 553 recorded cases in the country during this period.The report stated, “Lagos State accounts for 59.05 per cent of the recorded incidents in Nigeria. Taraba, Bayelsa, Gombe, and Yobe states had their first recorded collapse in 2022, and Zamfara has only one recorded building collapse, which happened in 2018. Also, 1971, 1975, and 1981 were years that had no recorded collapses.“The year 2022 has had the most collapses with 62 nationwide with Lagos accounting for 20. In addition, 2023 has recorded 12 collapses so far.”Findings by the guild revealed that professional ineptitude ranging from excessive loading, use of substandard materials, faulty design, poor workmanship and weak foundation accounted for a significant fraction of the collapses recorded during the period under review.The Pioneer President, Building Collapse Prevention Guild, Kunle Awobodu, blamed weak regulations for the incessant cases of building collapse in Lagos State.He said,” There is a difference between policy formulation and implementation. One of the things we discovered was that the staff strength of the building control agency was low compared to the vastness of the Lagos built environment. Quackery is also a major problem. To forestall the frequency of collapsed buildings, developers must submit their approval plan to undergo an approval process, including checking the structural design to identify anomalies.“Once the approved building plans are returned to their owners, the system does not follow up to check and ensure that those who will handle the construction are professionals. So, the construction will just be given to anybody who claims to have experience in building construction.”Nigeria tops homelessness list in the World“Nigeria has the world’s greatest number of homeless people. Within the nation, 24 million people don’t have homes,” data from World Population Review has reported.According to the report, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, and this presents an epidemic of homelessness throughout the nation.It stated, “Over 24 million people are considered homeless, with many more not having appropriate access to a proper dwelling that has access to some of the most basic services. With this being said, Nigeria is not as deep in poverty as others may think, as there are a lot of resources contained within the country. Much of the issue is due to access to wealth, which is often exploited by other countries or even their state.” Operators in the built sector have revealed that Nigeria has a meager 20 per cent homeownership rate among its population of 223 million, placing it significantly below its peer nations. Much of the issue is due to access to wealth, which is often exploited by other countries or even their state.” In contrast, even smaller countries like the Benin Republic, with a population of 11.8 million (about half of Lagos State’s population), have a homeownership level of 61 per cent. Much of the issue is due to access to wealth, which is often exploited by other countries or even their state.” Frequent reports issued by the National Bureau of Statistics; consistently depict a trajectory of growth or decline, hinting at the state of the housing component within the sector. Much of the issue is due to access to wealth, which is often exploited by other countries or even their state.” In Q3 of 2022, the NBS released a report underscoring the substantial impact of the construction and real estate sectors on the GDP during the first three quarters of 2022. Much of the issue is due to access to wealth, which is often exploited by other countries or even their state.” Further insights from the report indicated that the real estate services sector witnessed a nominal growth rate of 9.13 per cent during this period, surpassing the growth rate observed in the same period in 2021 by 0.50 per cent. Much of the issue is due to access to wealth, which is often exploited by other countries or even their state.” The real estate sector’s journey to positive growth began in the last quarter of 2020, marking its recovery from a recession that persisted for six consecutive quarters. Much of the issue is due to access to wealth, which is often exploited by other countries or even their state.” Nevertheless, despite this positive momentum, the housing segment of the sector continues to grapple with a widening deficit of over 28 million housing units.According to the latest data released by the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics recently, the sector contributed a total of N8.33tn in the quarter compared to the N9tn generated in the fourth quarter of 2022.The NBS attributed the decline to the adverse effects of the cash crunch experienced during the quarter.A breakdown analysis showed that the real growth rate of the construction sector reduced by 1.56 per cent points from the rate recorded in the previous year.The NBS, however, noted the sector contributed 11.79 per cent to nominal GDP in the first quarter of 2023, higher than the 9.68 per cent it contributed a year earlier and higher than the 10.16 per cent contributed to the fourth quarter of 2022.Despite all these, the homeownership level remains low, and experts have identified a number of factors responsible for this disparity or mismatch.InflationTo tame the accelerating inflation rate in the country, the Central Bank of Nigeria has hiked the interest rate from 11.5 per in April 2022 to 18.75 per cent in July this year.

At least six bridges have been washed away as heavy rains lashed different parts of the Himalayan state. Officials said three people lost their lives in the town of Singtam. ""Three bodies have been recovered from Singtam during rescue and relief efforts,"" a Sikkim State Disaster Management Authorityofficial saidWednesday. The Indian Army said 23 soldiers went missing Wednesday morning due to flooding along the Teesta River, which flows through Sikkim's Lachen Valley to the eastern state of West Bengal before entering neighboring Bangladesh. Floodwaters also marooned the army's vehicles parked in the area. ""Some army establishments located in the Lachen Valley have been affected. At least 23 personnel have been reported missing and some vehicles are reported submerged under the slush. Vehicles parked at Bardang near Singtam were affected,"" it said in a statement. Some buildings and structures were washed away, and parts of a major highway that connects the mountainous state to the rest of the country were badly affected. ""The exact number of people who have gone missing is still not confirmed. We are gathering details. As of now, we have confirmed reports of seven people going missing,"" Prabhakar Rai, director of Sikkim State Disaster Management Authority, said before three bodies were recovered Wednesday. It was initially reported that the flash flood was caused by acloudburst, which happens when an area of about 3.8 square miles receives around 10 centimeters (3.9 inches) of rainfall in an hour. However, the India Meteorological Department's (IMD) regional office in Gangtok later said the situation was not due to a cloudburst, local news outletHindustan Timesreported. An India Meteorological Department official said the state received 1.5 inches of rainfall in the last 24 hours. ""The maximum rain received in north Sikkim in the last 24 hours was 39 mm. So, we can't say it was a cloud burst,"" the IMD official added.

MEXICO CITY Hurricane Otis strengthened from tropical storm to a … [+1118 chars]",Bermuda,"People are helped as they cross a highway blocked by a landslide triggered by Hurricane Otis near Acapulco, Mexico, on Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2023.Marco Ugarte/APhide caption People are helped as they cross a highway blocked by a landslide triggered by Hurricane Otis near Acapulco, Mexico, on Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2023. ACAPULCO, Mexico — Hurricane Otis slammed Mexico's southern Pacific coast as a powerful and dangerous Category 5 hurricane Wednesday, unleashing massive flooding in the resort city of Acapulco, sending sheets of earth down steep mountainsides, and leaving large swaths of the state of Guerrero without power or cellphone service. While little is known about possible deaths or the full extent of the damage — the main highway into Acapulco was impassable — experts are calling Otis the strongest storm in history to make landfall along the Eastern Pacific Coast. Acapulco's Diamond Zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, appeared to be mostly underwater in television footage shared online Wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water. Large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. Dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. People wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other less-flooded streets soldiers shoveled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement. By late Wednesday afternoon, Otis had weakened to below tropical depression strength and was dissipating over the mountains, yet many on the coast were left reeling. Just outside Acapulco, Flor Campos trudged for more than an hour through mud along a highway Wednesday morning before she peeled off her shoes, worried she'd lose them in the muck. The domestic worker from a small town in Guerrero was among dozens of families, women and children who clambered over tree trunks and other debris left by landslides in the mountainous terrain. It was a daunting escape, but people were desperate to get out. ""We had been waiting since 3 in the morning to get out, so we decided to walk. It was more dangerous to stay. There are trees knocked down, power lines down,"" Campos said. ""There are children back there, 2 or 3 years old, with no water, nothing."" On Tuesday, Otis took many by surprise when it rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 as it tore along the coast. Researchers tracking the storm told The Associated Press that the storm broke records for how quickly it intensified, at a time whenclimate change has exacerbateddevastating weather events like this one. ""It's one thing to have a Category 5 hurricane make landfall somewhere when you're expecting it or expecting a strong hurricane, but to have it happen when you're not expecting anything to happen is truly a nightmare,"" said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. Acapulco, Tecpan and other towns along the Costa Grande in Guerrero were hit hard, said Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. He said conditions were so bad that communication with the area had been ""completely lost."" Acapulco is a city of nearly 1 million people at the foot of steep mountains. Luxury homes and slums alike cover the city's hillsides with views of the glistening Pacific. Once drawing Hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, Acapulco has in more recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving many international tourists to the Caribbean waters of Cancun and the Riviera Maya or beaches farther down the Pacific coast in the state of Oaxaca. Between the internationally known resorts of Acapulco and Zihuatanejo are two dozen small towns and villages. On the outskirts of Acapulco on Wednesday, highway workers looked on helplessly without the heavy machinery needed to clear debris from the roadway. They warned the road could give way at any time because of the rain-softened ground beneath. Bridges in some areas had collapsed, and trees leaned almost horizontally across the highway, not because they were uprooted, but because the earth they grew on had slid down the slope. Damage to the local military airport made it hard for authorities to access the region, López Obrador said. He said high-ranking members of his government would travel to Guerrero to help. Mexico's Secretary of National Defense told The Associated Press on Wednesday that 7,000 military personnel had been deployed to the area, and that more than 1,200 more were on their way. A long convoy of trucks from the national electric company moved through the Guerrero state capital, Chilpancingo, toward Acapulco before dawn Wednesday. Officials in Guerrero said on Wednesday afternoon that they were working to restore phone service. Otis is stronger than Hurricane Pauline, which hit Acapulco in 1997, López Obrador said. Pauline destroyed swaths of the city and killed more than 200 people. Hundreds of others were injured in flooding and mudslides. Otis' arrival camejust days after Hurricane Normastruck the southern tip of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula to the north. While many were caught by surprise, Acapulco still was able to open two dozen shelters in the hours before Otis made landfall. Videos from hotel guests in Acapulco posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, as the storm came ashore showed blinding horizontal rain and howling winds. In one, white towels danced high above a hotel's cavernous courtyard like sheets of paper and bed mattresses trembled on balconies, apparently put there to blunt the storm's winds. Another showed wind and rain howling unimpeded down hotel hallways. In still another, a family huddled inside a hotel room shower to escape breaking windows and fierce wind. In the Atlantic, Hurricane Tammy moved northeast over open water with winds of 105 mph after sweeping through the Lesser Antilles over the weekend. Tammy was about 515 miles southeast of Bermuda, and was moving northeast at about 13 mph. The storm was expected to become a powerful extratropical cyclone by Thursday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.","['mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'india', 'guatemala', 'unitedstates']",us,True,False

Philippe had 50 mph winds and was making its closest approach to Bermuda Friday afternoon. It is expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain to the island throughout the day. The system has transitioned into a more sprawling, wet and windy mess known as a post-tropical storm, and is on track to hit Maine Saturday night. A soggy, miserable weekend is likely across much of the Northeast, with the greatest chances for heavy rain likely in northern New England. Rain instigated by the cold front is already starting to work its way into far western parts of the Northeast Friday and will keep moving east through the weekend. ALevel 2 of 4slight risk of excessive rainfall was issued for Saturday by NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center in areas where repeated bouts of rain could trigger localized flash flooding. Much of the Northeast is coming off of one ofits wettest summers on record, NOAA data shows. The wet trend has only continued into fall, raising the risk for flash flooding. Parts of the Northeastwere inundated byrecord-breaking rainfalllast week. The most intense rainfall hit the New York City tri-state, where floodwaters inundated subways, roads and basements and several locations recorded the wettest day in history. Heavy rainfall is not expected to be as severe as last week, but a widespread 1 to 3 inches of rain is possible north of New York City in New York and into New England. Higher amounts closer up to 5 inches could fall where the heaviest rain sets up, most likely in Maine. Fall foliage is nearing or at peak condition in parts of Maine, so the timing of Philippe’s drenching rainfall could disrupt leaf peeping plans this weekend. In addition to heavy rain, gusty winds are possible across portions of New England and Atlantic Canada Saturday night into Sunday as Philippe comes ashore. Wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph are likely in Maine, with potential for stronger gusts on the coast. Lesser gusty winds will be more widespread across New England.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",us,True,True

The storm was expected to arrive late Saturday with gusts up to 50 mph (80 kph) in eastern and northern Maine, strong enough to cause power outages, along with 1 to 4 inches (2.5 to 10 centimeters) of rain over a broader area in a state where the ground is already saturated from previous rain, said Anne Strauser, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Maine. Down East Maine and Atlantic Canada were expected to bear the storm's brunt just three weeks after being hit by Tropical Storm Lee. Philippe, now a low pressure system, no longer a tropical storm, should be milder but will still pack a punch. The National Weather Service in Gray, Maine, said a high surf advisory was in effect for Sunday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. with waves from 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) on the Maine coast including York, Cumberland, Sagadahoc, Lincoln, Knox and Waldo counties and on the New Hampshire coast in Rockingham County. The dreary forecast meant another washout for many in New England, which already dealt with heavy rain, powerful thunderstorms, flash flooding and even tornadoes in the past month. Maine’s largest city, Portland, experienced the second-wettest summer in terms of rainy days. June and July were especially brutal with rainfall during six out of eight weekends during that stretch. Boaters, beachgoers, hikers, campers and others who enjoy the outdoors have lamented the wet weather. “The weather is a big topic of conversation, mostly about how poor it’s been,” said Vanessa Donnelly, general manager of Four Points Marina, which has 150 boat slips in Portland Harbor. Rainy weather has slowed boating activity, she said. Philippe made landfall in Barbuda late Monday while drenching the northeast Caribbean, downing trees and power lines in a handful of islands. The storm lost some steam after hitting Bermuda on Friday and heading northward into colder waters. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Lidia swirled through open waters in the Pacific on Friday night. A National Hurricane Center update at 11 p.m. EST said the storm was located about 515 miles (825 kilometers) west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, and about 460 miles (745 kilometers) south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California with maximum sustained winds of up to 70 mph (110 kph). Lidia was moving west at 6 mph (9 kph) but expected to turn northwest and north over the weekend. Surf swells will begin affecting the west coast of Mexico and the Baja peninsula in California on Saturday, the center said.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'france', 'antiguaandbarbuda', 'spain', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'hungary']",us,True,True

As many as 1.81 billion people, or 23% of the world population, areestimatedto be directly exposed to significant flood risks, but these risks are unequally distributed, with 89% of the world's flood-exposed people living in low- andmiddle-income countries.In Brazil, four in ten municipalities are vulnerable to disasters due to floods and landslides, according to the National Disaster Surveillance and Early Warning Center (CEMADEN), which currently monitors 1,038 municipalities on a daily basis and issues warnings when there is a risk of above-average rainfall.""The article synthesizes the trajectory of a project, its conclusions, and in particular its continuation via the CEMADEN Education Program as public policy for environmental education on reducing the risk of disaster,"" said João Porto de Albuquerque, first and corresponding author of the article. He is a researcher at the University of Glasgow in the United Kingdom.""Its main scientific contribution is the methodology we constructed, involving a new way of producing data with information technology and a process of co-production with communities and residents. We also took pains to make it multidisciplinary, assembling a research group that includes professionals in public administration,urban studies, geography, computer science andenvironmental education, as well as humanities and software development.""The results are part of Waterproofing Data, a project involving the Universities of Glasgow and Warwick (UK), the University of Heidelberg (Germany), and CEMADEN and Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) in Brazil.One of the most evident symptoms of the ongoing climate crisis is the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). A study conducted in January 2023 by the Brazilian Geological Survey (SGB) found 3.93 million people living in 13,500 high-risk areas across the country.In 2018, 8.2 million Brazilians lived in areas subject to floods and landslides in 872 municipalities, according to a report issued that year by CEMADEN and IBGE, the national census and statistics bureau. Examples of such areas are the parts of Rio Grande do Sul state hit by severe flooding in early September, with dozens of deaths and widespread destruction, as well as the disaster seen at the start of the year in several areas of the northern part of the coast of São Paulo state, with more than 60 deaths and major economic and financial losses.Collecting data""Our work has a very clear application to topics relating to the climate emergency and evidenced-based decision-making. Lack of data is a real problem in Brazil and several other countries, as well as the inequality that must be taken into account when formulating public policy. The project showed there are ways to change how the government handles the question of data, including people and territories,"" Maria Alexandra Cunha, a professor at FGV and co-author of the article, told Agência FAPESP.The research has resulted in a free smartphone app (availablefor Android) that can be used to collect data at strategic sites via citizen science to monitor rainfall, flooding and river levels. The data is transmitted in real time to adigital platformwith interactive maps accessible by local communities.The platform has been integrated into the website of the CEMADEN Education Program, which works with schools and communities and is being used as part of a nationwide disaster prevention campaign.To make the lessons learned in the project available to other regions, aLearning Guidewas created to help students and volunteers with the production of data and knowledge about disasters caused by excessive water flows and lack of urban drainage.""CEMADEN Education has created participatory and transformative methodologies to build a network of schools, young people, residents and local communities. Projects like Waterproofing Data are part of this process, helping us move on from thecase studyto gain scale. We expect the methodology to be used in many more areas,"" said Victor Marchezini, a researcher at CEMADEN and also a co-author of the article.StepsThe researchers used innovations inspired by what they call dialogic pedagogy, an approach developed by Paulo Freire, and based on the creation of knowledge construction networks, including (1) a situational analysis of lived experience and topics that fuel debate; (2) generative data originating new understanding; (3) critical reflection to change perspectives for action; (4) threshold or limit situations involving unsustainable living conditions; and (5) feasible unseens offering new paths to transcend threshold situations.They produced methodological interventions that made citizens and their experiences visible by means of data, motivating the community to engage with the process and share stories. In one case, an inhabitant of Jaboatão dos Guararapes (in Pernambuco state, Northeast Brazil) wrote a poem using the cordel form derived from popular culture and describing the data practices in which they participated.The community generated data and information, which circulated and were used more widely, opening up new paths to solutions and transformations. ""The first step in the search for solutions to problems is to make them visible, producing data, evidence and knowledge in each community. We hope to see the project continue as this approach is implemented in other regions and even abroad, in countries like Colombia, where we've already worked,"" Albuquerque said.","['brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedstates', 'uk', 'germany', 'colombia']",gb,True,False

The water in this river, a tributary of the mighty Congo River, is so dark that you literally can't see your hand in front of your face. ""We were struck by the color of the river,"" says ETH Zurich researcher Travis Drake, who has just published astudyin the journalLimnology and Oceanographyon the Ruki together with colleagues from the Sustainable Agroecosystems Group, led by Johan Six, as well as from other universities.Comparisons with other major tropical rivers show that the Ruki may even be the blackest large blackwater river on Earth—it's certainly a lot darker than the famous Rio Negro in the Amazon.The reason the water is black is that it contains large amounts of dissolved organic material and hardly any sediment because of the river's low gradient. Thesecarbon-rich substances are mostly washed into the river by the rain, which falls on dead jungle vegetation and leaches outorganic compoundsfrom the decomposing plant material. What's more, the river floods the forest in therainy season. It can take weeks for the often waist-deep water to slowly retreat, during which time it leaches organic substances. ""The Ruki is essentially jungle tea,"" Drake says.Peaty bogs and virgin rainforestIt's not just the dark water that's special. The Ruki, which is one kilometer wide and empties into the Congo, is unique in its entirety. Its drainage basin, which is four times the size of Switzerland, is still covered by untouched primary lowland rainforest. Along the river, there are big peat bogs containing gigantic amounts of undecomposed dead plant material, which makes them significant carbon sinks.Despite its uniqueness and size, the Ruki has never before been scientifically studied. While the river's different seasonal water levels have been documented since the 1930s, no data on its chemical composition has been available up to now. Nobody had yet determined how much dissolvedorganic carbon(DOC) is in the water and, above all, where it comes from.So in 2019, Drake and his colleagues set up a measuring station near the city of Mbandaka, a short distance upstream from where the Ruki and the Congo converge, and measured the water discharge every two weeks and daily water level for a year to determine the annual streamflow.""Our measurement methods on site were quite basic,"" Drake says. He relates that Mbandaka has no permanent power supply, only a few diesel generators and hardly any infrastructure—not even a power drill to install the flood level marker. ""So we often had to improvise,"" he says with a smile.Credit: ETH ZurichWhat water samples reveal about the RukiWater samples were collected with each discharge measurement and sent to the lab at ETH Zurich for analysis. There, the researchers determined the samples' DOC content as well as the age of the organic material based on the radioactive carbon in the DOC. Among other things, they wanted to find out whether the peat along the river releases carbon (and at some point decomposes into CO2).The researchers decided to examine the water because it contains carbon signatures from the entire drainage area, which in turn convey information about origin and land use. The advantage of water analysis: ""We need to collect samples from only one location to gain information about a huge area—like a doctor who takes a blood sample to determine the condition of a patient's health,"" says the study's co-author, Matti Barthel.Unexplored hydrologyThe analyses confirmed the visual impression: ""The Ruki is one of the most DOC-rich river systems in the world,"" Barthel says. Its water contains four times as much organic carbon compounds as the Congo's and 1.5 times as much as the Rio Negro's in the Amazon.And although the Ruki's drainage basin makes up only a twentieth of the entire Congo Basin, a fifth of the dissolved organic carbon in the Congo comes from this one tributary.DOC usually comes in the form of organic acids that increase the acidity of the river water. This stimulates the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) as the acids dissolve carbonates present in the water. ""CO2emissions are relatively high across the Ruki's entire drainage basin but not dissimilar to other tropical rivers,"" Drake explains. This is because the Ruki is a sluggish and placid river, which makes it more difficult for the CO2in the water to escape into the air. ""In a turbulent river, we'd see higher emissions,"" he says.According to Drake, the carbon isotope analysis also shows that most of the carbon comes from the forest vegetation, not the peat. Only for a short period of time at the end of the rainy season between March and April, after peak flow, do the researchers find evidence of the peat bogs releasing carbon into the water. It's not clear how and why this happens at that particular time. ""Overall, however, we see very little peat in the river,"" Drake says. ""And that's good news, because it also means that the peat bogs are stable.""At present, he says, there is no danger that the organic material contained in the peat bogs will be released, since they are under water almost all year round and thus not exposed to oxygen. However, companies have taken an interest in the Ruki Basin's natural resources. Changes in land use such as deforestation could alter the river regime. This might lead to peat bogs falling dry and being decomposed by bacteria, which would release a huge amount of CO2. ""The peat bogs in the Congo Basin store some 29 billion tons of carbon,"" Barthel says. ""It would be better for the climate if they stayed wet.""A long-standing research projectJohan Six and his group have been studying the Congo Basin's carbon cycle since 2008. The Congo is one of the most important tropical river systems on Earth. It carries huge amounts of carbon out into the sea. The vegetation in itsdrainage basinaffects its carbon cycle, as does land use. It was during a scouting trip to study the carbon cycle—the biogeochemistry—of the Congo Basin that the researchers came across the Ruki River.After their side trip to the Ruki, the scientists are now studying other tributaries of the Congo, such as the Kasaï and the Fimi River—and completing the carbon puzzle piece by piece.","['unitedkingdom', 'congo', 'congo', 'congo', 'congo', 'congo', 'congo', 'switzerland', 'democraticrepublicofthecongo']",gb,True,False

A local radio station put the death toll at 40, saying that many people are still missing. Rescue efforts were hampered by floods, forcing locals to pull bodies out of the debris with their bare hands. Heavy rainfall caused the Mefou River to burst its banks on Sunday, submerging several neighbourhoods. The impoverished neighbourhood of Mbankolo, where many houses were built precariously on a hillside, was worst affected. Local resident Ymele Guy told the BBC his child was killed by the flooding. ""I saw the disaster and just when I was informing my wife that things were bad, in a fraction of a second, my children and I were being submerged,"" he said. ""I saved my wife and at least three children. The rain took along the fourth... the rain snatched that child away."" Jouego Cathérine said her pregnant sister remained buried under the debris. ""I've still not found my sister. She got married in April. Together with her in-laws, all seven died here. Five corpses have already been recovered, it's remaining two — my sister and a young girl."" Landslides are frequent during the rainy season in Yaoundé - last year a soil embankment collapsed and killed at least 14 funeral attendees. During Sunday's disaster, dozens of houses were swept away by the raging floods. One home had been reduced to a mere passageway - a shortcut for emergency responders and grief-stricken residents. People from outside the neighbourhood turned up on Monday to witness the devastation, such was the scale of the disaster. Interior Minister Paul Atanga Nji urged people, including residents, to evacuate the area ""because the soil is unstable"". Many local people remain in the neighbourhood, however, as temporary accommodation is still being set up. ""We are organising rescue efforts, mattresses, blankets and all that,"" he said, adding that a three-month-old baby was among those who had been rescued. Poverty and poor infrastructure make communities such as Mbankolo more vulnerable to extreme weather such as heavy rain, which is becoming more frequent and intense in Africa due to climate change, according to United Nations climate experts. On Saturday, authorities in neighbouring Nigeria warned residents to expect floods in nine states as Cameroon began releasing water from its Lagdo Dam. It is expected to do this until the end of this month, Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) said, adding that Cameroon's dam was expected to spill water until the end of October. Cameroon says the release of water is necessary due to heavy rains in the country's north. The release would be kept to a minimum, officials added. Last year, the release of water from the dam caused flooding and fatalities in Nigeria, especially in Benue state, on the border with Cameroon.","['cameroon', 'nigeria', 'nigeria', 'nigeria', 'nigeria']",gb,False,False

The data it collects will help researchers understand two key functions of both ecosystem types: the capture and the release of carbon.Forests hold carbon in the wood of their trees; wetlands store it in their layers of organic soil. Disruption of either system, whether gradual or sudden, can accelerate the release of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. Tracking these land-cover changes on a global scale will help researchers study the impacts on the carbon cycle—the processes by which carbon moves between the atmosphere, land, ocean, and living things.""The radar technology on NISAR will allow us to get a sweeping perspective of the planet in space and time,"" said Paul Rosen, the NISAR project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. ""It can give us a really reliable view of exactly how Earth's land and ice are changing.""Tracking DeforestationForestry and other land-use changes account for about 11% of net human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. NISAR's data will improve our understanding of how the loss of forests around the world influences the carbon cycle and contributes to global warming.""Globally, we do not understand well the carbon sources and sinks fromterrestrial ecosystems, particularly from forests,"" said Anup Das, an ecosystems scientist and co-lead of the ISRO NISAR science team. ""So we expect that NISAR will greatly help address that, especially in less dense forests, which are more vulnerable to deforestation and degradation.""The signal from NISAR's L-band radar will penetrate the leaves and branches offorestcanopies, bouncing off the tree trunks and the ground below. By analyzing the signal that reflects back, researchers will be able to estimate the density of forest cover in an area as small as a soccer field. With successive orbital passes, it will be able to track whether a section of forest has been thinned or cleared over time.To show the kind of imagery NISAR will produce, researchers pointed to this composite that uses data from two Japanese L-band SAR missions to reveal land-cover change in Brazil’s Xingu River basin between 1996 and 2007. Black shows forest areas converted to farmland before 1996, and red shows additional areas cleared by 2007. Credit: Woodwell Climate Research Center/Earth Big Data LLC. Data courtesy of METI and JAXA.The data—which will be collected inearly morningand evening and in any weather—could also offer clues as to what caused the change, such as disease, human activity, or fire.It's an important set of capabilities for studying vast, often cloud-covered rainforests such as those in the Congo and Amazon basins, which lose millions of wooded acres every year. Fire releases carbon into the air directly, while the deterioration of forests reduces the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide.The data could also help improve accounting of deforestation and forest degradation—as well as forest growth—as countries that rely on logging try to shift toward moresustainable practices, said Josef Kellndorfer, a member of the NISAR science team and founder of Earth Big Data LLC, a provider of large data sets and analytic tools for research and decisions support. ""Reducing deforestation and degradation is low-hanging fruit to address a substantial part of the global carbon emission problem,"" he added.Monitoring wetland floodingWetlands present another carbon puzzle: Swamps, bogs, peatlands, inundated forests, marshes, and other wetlands hold 20 to 30% of the carbon in Earth's soil, despite constituting only 5 to 8% of the land surface.When wetlands flood, bacteria go to work digesting organic matter (mostly dead plants) in the soil. Through thisnatural process, wetlands are the planet's largest natural source of the potent greenhouse gas methane, which bubbles to the water's surface and travels into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, when wetlands dry out, the carbon they store is exposed to oxygen, releasing carbon dioxide.""These are huge reservoirs ofcarbonthat can be released in a relatively short time frame,"" said Erika Podest, a NISAR science team member and acarbon cycleand ecosystems researcher at JPL.Less well understood is how changing temperature and precipitation patterns due toclimate change—along with human activities such as development and agriculture—are affecting the extent, frequency, and duration of flooding in wetlands. NISAR will be able to monitor flooding, and with repeated passes, researchers will be able to track seasonal and annual variations in wetlands inundation, as well as long-term trends.By coupling NISAR's wetlands observations with separate data on the release of greenhouse gases, researchers should gain insights that inform the management ofwetland ecosystems, said Bruce Chapman, a NISAR science team member and JPLwetlandsresearcher. ""We have to be careful to reduce our impact on wetland areas so that we don't worsen the situation with the climate,"" he added.NISAR is set to launch in early 2024 from southern India. In addition to tracking ecosystem changes, it will collect information on the motion of the land, helping researchers understand the dynamics of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and subsidence and uplift (when the surface sinks and rises). It will also track the movements and melting of both glaciers and sea ice.Provided byNASACitation: NASA-ISRO radar mission to provide dynamic view of forests, wetlands (2023, October 27) retrieved 3 November 2023 ","['brazil', 'japan', 'congo', 'india']",gb,False,False

However, the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt (GASB) that emerged in 2011 has since then caused unprecedented inundations of this brown seaweed on Caribbean coastlines, with harmful effects on ecosystems while posing challenges to regional economies and tourism, and concerns for respiratory and other human health issues.Researchers looking into the question of what is the nutrient supply for the GASB say that they have now clearly identified that the nutrient content of Sargassum tissue could help determine the enrichment sources and potentially improve predictions and Sargassum management efforts.""We show clearly for the first time that Sargassum in the GASB is enhanced in both nitrogen and phosphorus, indicative of a healthy and thriving population,"" according to thejournal article""Nutrient and arsenic biogeochemistry of Sargassum in the western Atlantic,"" published inNature Communications.""Stable nitrogen isotope values point to riverine sources in some circumstances and are more equivocal in others. Distinguishing the various nutrient sources sustaining the GASB will require systematic snapshots of nutrient content andisotopic compositionacross its entire breadth,"" according to the paper.""Presumably, the closer one gets to the source, the higher the nitrogen and / or phosphorus content of Sargassum should be. In that sense, basin-wide patterns in nitrogen and phosphorus elemental composition could provide the fingerprinting necessary to unequivocally determine the sources.""The paper notes that a variety of nutrient sources for the GASB blooms have been suggested, including upwelling, vertical mixing, discharge from the Amazon and Congo rivers, and atmospheric deposition. Though, the paper states that the causes of the GASB and the mechanisms controlling its variability remain unknown.A large Sargassum mat in the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt sampled opportunistically by the R/V Ronald H. Brown as it occupied GO-SHIP line A16 in March 2023.

However, the proliferation of biomass in the tropical Atlantic has proven the old adage that too much of a good thing can be bad,"" said journal article lead author Dennis McGillicuddy, Jr., senior scientist in the Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering Department at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).The finding that nitrogen and phosphorus are higher in the GASB than in the Sargasso Sea ""is a smoking gun that the GASB inundations are nutrient-driven,"" said McGillicuddy. ""A consequence of this finding is that it presents us potentially with the opportunity to use those nitrogen and phosphorus markers in Sargassum tissue to fingerprint the ultimate sources of these nutrients that are sustaining these seaweed blooms.""In addition, the paper notes that the presence of arsenic in Sargassum tissue—which reflects phosphorus limitation—significantly constrains the utilization of the seaweed biomass that washes ashore.""As the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt has grown over the last decade, the public has become increasingly aware of this phenomenon and its impact on coastal communities,"" said co-author Peter Morton, associate research scientist in the Department of Oceanography at Texas A&M University, College Station.""Our research shows that Sargassum could become enriched in arsenic, depending on the conditions in which it grows. Plans to remove or exploit this material when it washes ashore should consider the potential for Sargassum to contain high concentrations of arsenic, so we encourage affected communities to proceed with caution when exploring options to deal with seasonal inundations of Sargassum.""Sargassum coverage based on satellite data. The white circles indicate sampling locations on GO-SHIP line A16. Credit: C. Hu and B. Barnes.Due to the threats that the Sargassum inundations pose to the environment, economy, and human health, the paper recommends the need for expanded observational and modeling studies to understand the GASB's physical, biological, and chemical drivers. The paper notes that ""the societal need forscientific understandingis urgent: improved seasonal to interannual predictions would offer tremendous value for proactive planning and response, while quantification of the underlying causes could inform potential management actions to mitigate the problem.""McGillicuddy first saw Sargassum when he was a child growing up in Florida and his grandfather took him fishing near the seaweed because that was the best place to fish. ""It was an oasis in the oceanic desert,"" McGillicuddy said.""Now, the system has changed in a fundamental way. We've got an oceanographic process out there that is creating this. As a scientist, and as a fisherman, I feel an urgent need to try to understand this situation, not only to help answer the interesting scientific questions around this problem, but do so in a way that we are able to understand the situation and eventually mitigate it in a way that would be of value to society,"" he said.McGillicuddy and co-author Brian Lapointe also stressed the importance of the interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of this research, which encompasses a number of disciplines including biology, chemistry, and physics.""This collaborative study illustrates the value of interdisciplinary research teams to understanding complex oceanographic phenomena in an era of rapid global change, in this case, the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt that formed in 2011,"" said co-author Brian Lapointe, a research professor at Florida Atlantic University's Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, and one of the world's foremost authorities on Sargassum.","['congo', 'unitedstates']",gb,False,False

Since Thursday, at least four people have died in the storm, named Babet by the UK Meteorological Office. The latest victim was a 33-year-old woman who was killed when a tree fell on her car on the Baltic Sea island of Fehmarn on Friday afternoon, German news agency dpa reported. Three storm-related deaths were reported in England and Scotland on Thursday and Friday. Gale-force winds whipped up storm surges on the southern shores of the Baltic Sea, breaking through flood defenses in coastal areas in Denmark and northern Germany. In Flensburg, a German city just south of the border with Denmark, water levels rose more than 2 meters to the highest level recorded in a century, dpa said. Power was cut to flooded parts of the city for safety reasons. Ferry lines and railway service were temporarily suspended in affected areas in Germany, Denmark and southern Sweden. Copenhagen’s airport canceled 142 flights due to the storm on Friday but resumed operations on Saturday morning. People were evacuated from homes and campgrounds in severely hit areas in Denmark and dozens of people were without power. The municipality of Haderslev in southern Denmark decided to evacuate the entire coastline. “The situation on the coast is now so serious that it is too dangerous to stay there. All affected areas are evacuated and the emergency response is pulling out its crews,” the municipality said in a Facebook post late Friday. It wasn't immediately clear how many people were affected. The Danish Meteorological Institute warned of strong winds and elevated water levels throughout the weekend. In Scotland, as much as 4 inches (100 mm) of rain was forecast Saturday, and several towns remained under a red weather alert, the highest level, which means there is a danger to life. Met Office meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey said parts of eastern and northern Scotland had already had a month and a half’s worth of rain during the storm, with more downpours coming that could “push those areas close towards two months of rain in the span of three days.” In the worst-hit town of Brechin, residents of more than 300 homes were told to leave before the River South Esk breached its banks Friday, surging almost 4 meters (13 feet) above its usual level and sending water pouring into the streets. The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency warned a second major river, the Don, could breach on Saturday. Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf said, “unfortunately, it is clear we have not seen the last of this storm.” The storm brought disruption across the U.K., with several main roads and rail lines shut by flooding. Leeds-Bradford Airport in northern England remained closed Saturday.","['denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'germany', 'germany', 'germany', 'germany', 'turkey', 'sweden', 'uk']",us,False,False

COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Gale-force winds and floods struck several countries in northern Europe as the region endured more heavy rain on Friday that forecasters say will continue into the weekend. Three deaths in the U.K. were blamed on the bad weather. The winds are expected to hit hardest in the eastern part of Denmark's Jutland peninsula and the Danish islands in the Baltic Sea. But the northern part of the British Isles, southern Sweden and Norway, and northern Germany are also in the path of the storm, named Babet by U.K.'s weather forecaster, the Met Office. Eastern Scotland continued to bear the brunt of the stormy weather. On Friday, the Met Office issued a new ""red"" warning, its highest, for parts of the region through Saturday. ""This is not usual autumn weather,"" said Andy Page, the Met's chief meteorologist. ""This is an exceptional event, and we are likely to continue to see significant impacts with the potential for further flooding and damage to properties."" On Friday, police reported that a man in his 60s died after getting caught in fast-flowing flood water in the central England county of Shropshire. In Scotland, a 57-year-old woman died Thursday after being swept into a river in the region of Angus, where hundreds of homes were also evacuated. Also on Thursday, a 56-year-old man died after his van hit a falling tree in the same area. Though forecasters said the worst of the heavy rain in Scotland had passed, they warned that conditions will remain difficult, with river levels still on the rise and flood defenses breached. Some parts of the town of Brechin are only accessible by boat after its flood defenses were overwhelmed by the heavy rainfall, raising concerns about further loss of life. ""I cannot stress how dangerous conditions are in Brechin in particular,"" said Scotland's first minister, Humza Yousaf. Wind gusts in excess of 60 mph (100 kph) were likely on Friday. Several major road sections and rail routes were closed in Scotland, while air passengers were facing flight cancellations. The storm has already brought more than a month's worth of rain in the worst-affected regions in Scotland and was pummeling many parts of England on Friday. At Leeds Bradford Airport, a flight arriving from the Greek island of Corfu skidded off the runway while landing in windy conditions. There were no reported injuries and ensuing arrivals were diverted to other airports.

""We are working with the airline, relevant operations teams and emergency authorities to address this situation and remove passengers from the aircraft safely,"" a spokesperson for the airport said. In northeastern England, a lighthouse at the mouth of the River Tyne lost its distinctive red and white dome. Port of Tyne officials said it was not yet safe to assess the damage to the South Shields lighthouse while weather conditions remained dangerous. The swirling weather system was also hitting other parts of Northern Europe, particularly Denmark. The Danish Meteorological Institute wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that it expects water levels ""to exceed the 100-year event in several places."" Police in southern Denmark — the Danish region expected to be the worst hit — said a number of sections of road in low-lying areas were flooded and some trees had fallen. Police said a dike was breached and urged people to immediately leave Sandersvig Strand on the Jutland peninsula. Danish meteorologists issued their highest warning for ""very dangerous weather"" and said levels of some inland waters were expected to rise up to 240 centimeters (nearly eight feet) above normal. In neighboring Sweden, meteorologists warned of the risk of extensive flooding which may cause limited access on roads and railways along the southern coasts of the Scandinavian country. Water levels were expected to begin dropping again on Saturday morning, Swedish meteorologists said. A bridge near Norway's second-largest city was protectively closed, the Bergens Tidende newspaper said. Ferries across the region were canceled and air traffic was hampered, with delays and a few cancellations. The Swedish Transportation Authority suspended service of several train and bus lines in southern Sweden, because of the weather, prompting Skanetrafiken, the operator of the local transit system, to recommend ""avoiding travel on public transport."" ""Some regional bus routes will be canceled and there is a risk that both regional and replacement buses in service may also be canceled at short notice,"" Skanetrafiken said on its website. In Germany, some streets and squares were flooded in the cities of Flensburg, Kiel and Wismar on the Baltic coast. Fallen trees caused some disruption, including a railway line. Ferry operator Scandlines suspended services on its Roedby-Puttgarden and Gedser-Rostock routes between Denmark and Germany. On Germany's North Sea coast, the high winds had the opposite effect to the flooding on the Baltic coast, pushing the water further out and leading to very low water levels. Ferries to some North Sea islands were canceled.","['denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'uk', 'uk', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'sweden', 'sweden', 'sweden', 'norway', 'norway', 'germany', 'germany', 'germany', 'germany', 'germany', 'turkey', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'greece']",us,True,False

The heavy sledges move nicely, because there is not much snow on the ice today. The journey isn't far either, as we're by the city of Kuopio, which is surrounded by Finland's 10th largest lake. Despite the temperature of -10˚, I need to take off my hat—the sun in early March is already warm, or it could be the fact that the heavy sledge is following me obediently.We're crossing the icy bay not for sport or holiday activities, nor is it part of a plan to hike to north Pole. Instead, our focus is in research. We are determinedly walking to the middle of the bay to collect a sediment core from its bottom. Mud—or sediments, as geologists call them—are deposited slowly at the bottom of lakes. How quickly mud accumulates varies greatly depending on the body of water, but at this bay in Lake Kallavesi, about 1 centimeter of sediment is deposited annually. Logically, the new sediment is deposited on top of earlier layers, and so sediments are like time machines—the deeper you dig into the older sediments, the further you reach into the past. You can think of sediments like libraries of a lake's untold stories, and if you can read the words of the sediment core, they can tell amazing stories.Lake Kallavesi has a specific and rare type of sediments called annually laminated orvarved sediments. They're composed of a bright and dark couplets one after the other, just like tree rings, that can be counted backwards. It is possible to check how your birth year looked—or your grandmother's birth year. Such sediment layers can reach back thousands of years.The history of plastic, buried in the mudOur historical destination this time is much more recent—we want to investigate the presence of plastic particles within the natural sediment. It's a continuation of our ongoing research, most recently published in theJournal of Soils and SedimentsinFebruary 2023.Widespread use of plastic started about 70 years ago, and since then, 9 billion metric tons has been produced.Only 12% is incinerated, meaning that 7.5 billion metric tons are still with us somewhere—recycled and in use; in landfills or dump pits, or in nature, including our waters. The weight of all that plastic is more than that of all the people on the planet—there's about 1,000 kg of plastic for each of us, mostly in form of waste. What would you do with your share? What would I do?The core of the lake sediment reveals brighter and darker bands that allow us to look back into time. Credit: Fourni par l'auteurThese are my thoughts when I am drilling a hole in the ice. It would be nice to work on lake on a sunny summer day, but the thick ice serves as a stable platform. It allows us to spread all our corers, saws, sledges, tubes, wires, and hot water pots around us. We use metal rods to push the core tubes down 11 meters to the lake floor and then into the sediment. A few minutes later, we lift the core tube out on the water. It was known that the bay is polluted, but we're surprised by the strong smell of oil when the core emerges.Because plastic is verydurable material, it works well as a core tube. This benefit is also plastic's worst aspect: released into the environment, it doesn't decompose but breaks into ever smaller pieces.Particles smaller than 5 mm are called microplastics, and they have only been studied since 2004, after Richard Thompsonaccidently noted their presencein coastal sediments near Plymouth, England. While it's a relatively new research field, we already know that microplastics areharmful pollutantsthat endanger animal life—including our own—and that they are found everywhere from the top of the Himalayas to the deepest oceans.Like natural particles, microplastics are transported to the lakes by rivers, rainfall, and wind. They can float in the surface but finally sink to the bottom. There they will be slowly buried under new layers of sediments. But how much microplastics has increased in the nature since the last 70 years? Let's go to see what the sediment library can tell us.The ABCs of reading sediment layersThe 2-meter sediment core lies on the metallic table at our laboratory. As we saw open the core, my skin gets goosebumps. It might be the noise or maybe it is just excitement—after all, you never know beforehand what the sediment will look like.Sediments consist of natural materials as well as pollutants. Detrital materials such as clay, silt and sand are washed into the lake by spring floods that follow the melting of snow—this is the bright layer in Lake Kallavesi sediment. The thicker the bright layer is, the more intensive the spring flood and higher the snow was during the winter.The core of the lake sediment reveals brighter and darker bands that allow us to look back into time. Credit: Fourni par l'auteurThere is also a lot of organic matter in the sediments—not only plants transported by the rivers and pollen flown in from long distances, but also algae. On sunny summer days, they bloom on the lake's surface and so serve as a buffet for the zooplankton that graze on the surface. When these microscopic organisms die, they too sink to bottom and become part of the mud.Sediments also bear witness to human activities. Building a bridge or a road involves digging and can increase erosion, and oursedimentshows bright layers that can be several centimeters thick. A significant number of pollutants are buried within the sediments—we found trace metals such as mercury, copper, lead and zinc as well aspetroleum hydrocarbon fractionsandPAH compoundsthat are ecologically risky and potentially dangerous to health. Many are related to burning of fossil fuels. In addition to this chemical cocktail, the sediments were flavored by a large amounts of microplastics.Occasionally I get the feeling that I never went too far from my childhood. Playing with water and mud was the greatest thing I could imagine for the summer holidays, and nowadays I keep on doing very similar activities—collect mud, treat it in different ways, put it in all kinds of cups and machines. I often come home with my clothes splashed with mud. Today, however, I'm planning my playing in more detail, having spent weeks in the laboratory preparing these sediments for analysis.Two steps forward, one steps backThe preliminary results show that the amount of heavy metals and oil fractions have decreased significantly from the peak in the 1970s toward the present day. This is good news, because it tells us that we've come to understand the harmfulness of these chemicals and our actions to preserve nature have paid off. Unfortunately, that's not the case for microplastics—their presence in the sediments is increasing over time.The materials most frequently found are polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene, often employed for so-called single-use products such as packaging. In the annual layers we can immediately find the years 2011-2013, when there was significant construction work and dredging in the harbor. During this period, a huge number of microplastics are present with a large diversity of types.With such detailed information, we start to understand how human activities on the land have a direct influence on the microplastics in the water. In the future, we want to understand how all kinds of pollutants that are already in the nature can be attached to microplastic particles, and what when such particles are eaten by plankton and animals that graze on the bottom of lakes. There is still much we do not understand from microplastics and the risks they pose, but our knowledge increases with everysediment core. It is not piece of cake, but a mud cake.","['finland', 'finland', 'finland', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom']",gb,True,False

Prosecutors said prisoners could buy ""any drugs"" they wanted inside HMP Lindholme in South Yorkshire while Amy Hatfield, 38, was employed there as a mental health nursing assistant. Hatfield had a sexual relationship with inmate Joseph Whittingham, 35. Their affair was at the heart of the largest prison drug smuggling ring ever uncovered, Sheffield Crown Court heard. Seventeen people are being sentenced for roles in the conspiracy. They include six Lindholme inmates, family members including parents, partners and siblings, and other associates who helped to smuggle drugs including heroin, MDMA, spice, ketamine and cannabis into the prison and launder the profits. Knives, mobile phones and prescription drugs were also secretly carried into the jail, where the contraband would sell for up to 10 times its value, the court heard. South Yorkshire Police uncovered the smuggling network after Hatfield, of Hawthorne Street, Barnsley, was caught arriving at work with drugs worth an estimated £1m behind bars. She was arrested in October 2019 after officers stopped her entering Lindholme with MDMA, cannabis and Ribena bottles filled with spice, as well as tobacco, anabolic steroids, mobile phones and chargers. Hatfield would have drugs delivered to her home before passing on packages to Whittingham and other prisoners Jordan Needham, 31, Kieran Murphy, 26, and convicted murderer Anthony Campbell, 38, to sell behind bars. The nursing assistant, whose role involved assessing vulnerable prisoners for possible mental health problems, would arrange bogus appointments with the drug-dealing inmates to deliver the packages. ""She brought in such quantities and on such a regular basis that HMP Lindholme was flooded with drugs,"" prosecutor Gordon Stables told the court at the opening of a six-day sentencing hearing. He said Hatfield brought in ""significant quantities"" of spice, in both liquid and granular form, of such strength that inmates were ""going over on it"" and healthcare staff fell ill after inadvertently inhaling the fumes. Toxicology tests found the spice recovered from Hatfield matched a batch which killed an inmate, Kyle Batsford, who had been bullied into testing the drug in September 2019. The court heard another inmate was left in a coma for 10 days and permanently lost the use of his legs after he was pressured by Needham into being a ""guinea pig"" for a new batch of spice. There were seven spice-related deaths at Lindholme in the two years before Hatfield's arrest but none in the eight months after she was taken into custody, Mr Stables said. Police said Murphy had planned to use knives smuggled into Lindholme by Hatfield to attack a prison officer. Anti-corruption detectives had started investigating Hatfield, who had worked at the prison since September 2018, after learning she had begun a relationship with Whittingham in the summer of 2019. The court heard Hatfield and Whittingham would meet for sex in the prison, swap explicit pictures over contraband mobile phones, and would see each other two or three times a week despite other inmates waiting months for mental health appointments. Mr Stables said the pair, who both had partners outside prison, ""made plans for a life together"" after Whittingham's release and continued to exchange love letters even after Hatfield's arrest. Whittingham, from Bradford, used his wife Lucy and father Paul as ""bankers"" who received payments from his customers, the court heard. Hatfield's arrest led police to identify other routes through which drugs were smuggled into Lindholme. Campbell, who is serving a life sentence for arranging the fatal shooting of a 16-year-old boy in Liverpool in 2004, would receive deliveries from prison visitors arranged by his mother Deborah Stoddard, 56. The pair had previously smuggled drugs and other contraband into HMP Northumberland and HMP Wealstun in West Yorkshire during Campbell's time as an inmate in the prisons. Mr Stables said Stoddard was ""a driving force in the operation"" and ""acted as a banker for the conspiracy,"" as well as buying, wrapping and transporting drugs. The prosecutor said Needham and his partner Courtney Ward, 26, ""exploited almost every possible avenue"" to smuggle contraband into Lindholme, including fake confidential mail and an attempt to intercept another inmate's hospital appointment. Mr Stables said ""essentially any drugs inmates sought"" were available inside Lindholme, with rife drug use placing staff under ""extreme"" pressure. He added: ""The police are not aware of another case of this scale. ""The quantities of drugs and phones within the prison were so great that prices dropped, making them even more affordable for inmates."" The 17 defendants all admitted or were found guilty of drug supply or money laundering charges between February 2020 and August this year. The sentencing hearing is due to conclude on Monday.

After a while, the vehicle becomes stuck. Economou points to the hillside above, 500 metres (yards) high, eaten into by Storm Daniel that struck central Greece this month. ""There used to be an apple orchard there. All the trees were carried away by the flood,"" the 53-year-old tells AFP. ""Some people will not be able to reach their fields at all. They will get zero income this year,"" Economou adds. The deluge caused by Storm Daniel three weeks ago, unleashing months' worth of rain in just hours, destroyed roads and bridges, drowned tens of thousands of farm animals and left 17 people dead. ""I lost 100 trees at one of my farms,"" says Antonis Laskos, 62. ""They were uprooted and ended up in the sea."" Zagora is Greece's apple powerhouse, with a farm cooperative that dates to 1916. Some 800 families have built their lives on the fruit. The area's Zagorin apples -- a Starking Delicious variety introduced from California in the early 1950s -- have since 1996 carried a protected European designation of origin label. The villagers of Zagora, the area which produces some of Greece's finest apples, say up to 80 percent of the local road network has been knocked out and will not be easy to replace. And even the surviving crop is hard to bring in, as the only bridge left standing in the area cannot sustain the 45-ton trucks normally used for transport, according to cooperative head Yiannis Kravvaris. ""Smaller trucks will have to be used, and this will push up costs significantly,"" he notes. ""There are rebuilding efforts but the damage is so extensive that it's impossible to fix everything,"" says Ioulia Papoulia, an agronomist in charge of quality control at the Zagorin farm co-operative. ""Last year we had 18.5 million apples. This year we'll be lucky to get five million kilos,"" she says. The Athens Observatory put Zagora at the epicentre of the storm. From September 4-8, the observatory recorded 1,096 millimetres of rain -- including over 750 millimetres on September 5. The average rainfall in the area is 150 millimetres. The previous maximum in Zagora was 231 millimetres in 2018. This week, another storm named Elias dumped an additional 96 millimetres of water. Harvester Costas Zervas, 50, says this year's apple crop was already problematic owing to climate change. ""We had frequent rain in June that caused disease. ""And the winter was mild. Apple trees need the cold, from 800 to 1,600 hours of frost annually,"" Zervas explains. Facing a barrage of criticism at a perceived failure in cooperation between the army and civil protection in the hours following the disaster, the government has pledged over two billion euros ($2.1 billion) in reconstruction funds. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who comfortably won re-election and a second four-year term in June, has warned Greece is facing a ""climate war"". ""Over a two-week period, we experienced the worst wildfire and the worst floods in our history,"" Mitsotakis said this month. Fires across Greece killed at least 26 people this summer, most of them migrants trapped in a forest near the northeastern border with Turkey. A massive blaze in the Dadia National Park in northeastern Greece that burned for over two weeks was later described by the European Commission as the largest on record in Europe.","['greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'germany', 'germany', 'unitedstates', 'turkey']",us,True,False

The Sun says hostages with dual citizenship are ""said to have been earmarked for release"". According to the Daily Telegraph, calls for a delay to Israel's planned ground offensive in Gaza are now likely to increase. It quotes local media as saying the Israeli prime minister is holding off on the incursion, much to the frustration of his military chiefs. The paper also predicts a ""clash"" between the UK and US on one side and the European Union on the other. It says several EU leaders have signed a draft statement calling for a ""humanitarian pause"" in fighting, while British and American officials have refused to back calls for a ceasefire. ""PM blasts Met Police for not acting on 'jihadi' chants"" is the headline in the Daily Express. It praises Rishi Sunak for insisting the police already have the powers to arrest people who incite violence. The Daily Mail says his comments put him ""at loggerheads"" with the Scotland Yard commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, who defended a decision by his officers not to arrest demonstrators shouting ""jihad"" at a protest in London. In its leader column, the Times says it was a ""clear dereliction of duty"" and an operational failure. It suggests the police have ""turned a blind eye to antisemitic chanting"". But the i quotes senior police officers as saying they are ""sick"" of the government pushing them to ""reach beyond the law"" to arrest protesters for ""political gain"". The Sun reports that Coronation Street actress Dame Maureen Lipman, who is Jewish, has said she was offered security by ITV because of a rise in antisemitic attacks. Expressing surprise at the offer, Ms Lipman is quoted as saying: ""This is where we are now.""

Residents of the worst affected areas tell the paper they feel they've been abandoned - and say they were told after floods in 2007 that their homes would ""never be hit again"". The Financial Times reports on what it calls ""alarming"" figures from the Office for National Statistics showing that tenants in London spend 35% of their income on rental costs. It describes it as a UK ""black spot"" because it's the only area with a rent-to-income ratio above 30%, which is considered unaffordable. And the Guardian highlights research which suggests the Moon could be older than previously thought - by about 40 million years.

The security situation in Haiti is precarious due to high levels of gang-related crime. With this measure, the Security Council seeks to help maintain public safety and protect the population. At its meeting on 6 September, the Federal Council had adopted guidelines for negotiations within the Security Council concerning this resolution. Haiti is facing a worsening security crisis caused by rampant gang violence. Between January and June 2023 alone, gang members committed over 2,000 homicides. Sexual violence and kidnappings have taken on epidemic proportions. The Haitian national police do not have sufficient resources to contain the escalating violence. Moreover, the humanitarian situation is alarming: according to the FAO, around five million people, almost half of Haiti's population, are facing food insecurity. The threat of famine is looming. Severe flooding caused by torrential rains and an earthquake in June exacerbated the situation. With its decision of 2 October 2023, the UN Security Council responded to a request from the Haitian government. The UN secretary-general recently issued a report calling on the Security Council to adopt various measures to improve security in Haiti. A key recommendation includes the establishment of a multinational police support mission, which Kenya has agreed to lead. During the negotiations on the resolution, Switzerland advocated in particular for respect for international law and human rights to be guaranteed and for measures to be taken to prevent sexual abuse, and for a monitoring mechanism to be set up in the mission. On 6 September 2023, the Federal Council gave its preliminary approval for the authorisation of a security support mission for Haiti. It had issued guidelines for the negotiations in New York. In exceptional cases and under certain conditions, the mission should also be able to use force to fulfil its mandate of supporting the local police in restoring public order and security. Based on the modalities agreed between the Federal Council and the foreign policy committees of the National Council and the Council of States to involve Parliament during Switzerland's term on the Security Council, the chairs of the foreign affairs committees were consulted on this matter in accordance with Art. 152 para. 4 of the Parliament Act.","['haiti', 'haiti', 'haiti', 'haiti', 'haiti', 'haiti', 'kenya', 'switzerland', 'switzerland', 'unitedstates']",us,True,False

Only a small number of affluent residents will be able relocate from low-lying or waterfront properties, while many others without sufficient means may be trapped there, it says.The studywas just published in the journalEnvironmental Research Letters.""Most studies focus on the direct effects of inundation,"" said lead author Nadia Seeteram, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. ""Here, we were able to look at flooding on a very granular level, and add in other vulnerabilities.""The study combines building-by-building projections of flooding caused by direct sea-level rise, rainfall orstorm surgewith fine-grained demographic data to determine how residents will be affected. Along with flood maps, the researchers used U.S. Census Bureau data to chart economic andsocial factorsthat would make people more or less vulnerable, including age, race, level of education, income and status of employment, and whether they owned or rented their homes, among other measures. They then divided the population into four categories.With a one-meter sea-level increase—a middle-of-the-road scenario for the end of this century—56% of the population, primarily on higher ground, could face pressures to relocate, they say. The researchers call these people ""displaced.""The next largest group they labeled the ""trapped""—some 19% of the population, living in chronically flooded territory, but without the means to flee to safer nearby ground. About another 19% would be ""stable,"" according to the researchers—living in areas not prone to flooding and able to remain there. Just 7%—basically the wealthiest, which the researchers labeled as ""migrating""—would be directly exposed to flooding in waterfront or low-lying areas, but able to move to safer spots within the metro area.Current potential flood exposure (blue areas) in downtown Miami (left panel) and with one meter of sea-level rise. Deeper blues represent greater depth. Credit: Seeteram et al,Environmental Research Letters, 2023Not surprisingly, the study says that if sea levels rise even more than a meter, direct flooding, not economic pressures, will become the dominant force affecting residents. At two meters—fairly high amid the current range of estimates, but not out of the question—about 55% of the population will be directly inundated through a combination of high sea level and, to an increasing extent, rainfall. Under this scenario, 49% of the population would become trapped, and 25% displaced. Only 8% would be classified as stable.""This is where it gets to be more drastic, more existential,"" said Seeteram, who did much of the research during her Ph.D. studies at Florida International University. In either scenario, she said, the results would include potential depopulation of the area and devaluation of flooded properties, as people flee to safer inland regions. This could make it increasingly difficult for authorities to collect taxes to fund adaptations of infrastructure to keep the ocean at bay—a circular process that could send Miami-Dade into an increasingly dire downward spiral, both physical and fiscal.The study does not look at how many people are currently being affected by flooding, either directly or indirectly. But floods have already become a routine part of life, as monthly peaks in tides percolate up through the sewers during so-called sunny day flooding, and rain with nowhere to drain pools in streets.The kind of flash flooding in New York City that made big news after a big storm at the end of September would be viewed as just another day in parts of Miami during the May-October wet season, said Seeteram. A still unpublished survey by Seeteram and colleagues indicates that nearly three quarters of Miamians say they have been personally affected by flooding from rainfall in one way or another.There are also some indications that so-called climate gentrification—the displacement oflower-income peoplefrom higher-elevation areas predicted by the study—is already taking place. For instance, in the last few years, the Little Haiti neighborhood, a relatively lofty 10 feet above sea level, has seen a sudden surge in development and property values, worrying the largely Black residents that they may not be able to remain.Study co-author Katharine Mach of the University of Miami said there is ""a great, raging debate"" about whether climate gentrification is underway. ""I suspect it is already happening,"" she said. However, she said, at least for now, other factors may be playing larger roles in rapidly shifting real-estate values, including longtime pro-development policies and what she calls ""real-estate tourism,"" with speculators snapping up relatively inexpensive properties in a still booming region.""The question is, what fraction [of rising prices] can you put on climate?"" she said. She pointed out that real-estate prices are also going up in low-lying and waterfront areas, but not as fast as in less flood-prone areas—one possible indicator that predicted sea-level rise is playing a role in buyers' decisions.Seteeram said the projections in the new study may not necessarily come to pass, at least with lower estimates ofsea-level rise; it depends on how the metro area confronts the problems in coming years. If it revamps infrastructure to lessen flooding and takes other measures, that could blunt the effects, she said. ""We could see different kinds of housing development, to make the population denser in some areas, or more climate resilient. But then you would have to see what the intersection would be with affordability for a lot of people.""","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",gb,False,False

About 300 gangs are active across Haiti and 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, is under gang control. Many health facilities have stopped operating because of the gang violence. Health staff are often threatened. ICRC Director-General Robert Mardini spoke to the BBC from Port-au-Prince following a two-day visit to the Caribbean nation. ""In my 27 years serving the ICRC, I have rarely seen such a toxic and terrible combination of adverse factors hitting communities living in shanty towns,"" he said, describing streets flooded with sewage-contaminated water in the impoverished neighbourhood of Cité Soleil. ""With armed violence endemic, people live in constant fear of the next clash, the next kidnapping,"" he added. The levels of insecurity have been such that many health care facilities have stopped operating and large parts of the population lack access to essential services. Mr Mardini described speaking to one young doctor at a clinic who was ""performing miracles"" with just the most rudimentary tools available. With much of the capital fought over by rival gangs, locals are often confined to their neighbourhood and cannot cross the ""fault lines"" dividing their area from that controlled by another group. One man described to Mr Mardini how, in order to get his heavily pregnant wife to hospital to give birth, he had had to first push her in a wheelbarrow through the flooded streets to where he could transfer her onto a motorbike, before finally being able to lift her into a car for the last stretch of the journey. In order to gain access to areas where there is no state control and armed groups roam freely, the ICRC engages in ""continuous dialogue"" with the gangs. ""We do it systematically, one zone after the other. The number of groups is overwhelming and I can't pretend we have a dialogue with all of them,"" Mr Mardini explained, adding that the ICRC's ability to help Haitians depended on being known and accepted by the people on the ground. Mr Mardini says the dialogue with the gangs is something that the ICRC has to do, day in day out. ""If we interrupt it for seven or 10 days, we can't take it for granted that we can resume from where we left off, because very often there is a loose chain of command within the groups and there's infighting,"" Mr Mardini said of the constant changes within the gangs themselves. The ICRC's director-general said that his organisation would increase its humanitarian efforts in Haiti in 2024 in response to the growing needs there. The ICRC plans to step up its training for emergency health staff and Haiti's ambulance service to make accessing emergency services easier for those most affected by the violence. It will also increase the number of hospitals it provides with medical kits to treat wounded patients. Mr Mardini also urged the international community to ""invert Haiti's downward spiral"". ""When you have five million people depending on humanitarian aid, there is an ethical and moral responsibility to boost aid to Haiti,"" he concluded.","['haiti', 'haiti', 'haiti', 'haiti', 'haiti', 'haiti']",gb,False,False

The cliche goes that the first casualty of war is truth. With Israel’s occupation of Palestine, disinformation often comes with a side of anti-Palestinianism and Islamophobia, turbocharged by social media amplification, especially under Elon Musk’s leadership of X, formerly known as Twitter. But an intriguing element of the disinformation that has flooded social media since Hamas’s October 7 attack on southern Israel is that a lot of it has been produced or spread by right-leaning accounts based out of India. Some of these fake stories include Hamaskidnappinga Jewish baby andbeheading a youngboy on the back of a truck. Blue check accounts have pushed false reports into the stratosphere of virality. One extremely popular tweet shared by thousands of people even claimed the Hamas attack was aUS-ledpsyop. BOOM, one of India’s most reputed fact-checking services, found several verified Indian X users at the helm of a disinformation campaign. These “disinfluencers” – influencers who have routinely shared disinformation – have been “mostly targeting Palestine negatively, or being supportive of Israel”, according to BOOM. They have peddled tropes that have sought to showcase Palestinians as fundamentally brutal. In one instance, an account began circulating avideothat claimed to show dozens of young girls taken as sex slaves by a “Palestinian” fighter. However, the video was likely from a school trip to Jerusalem. While relatively low quality, if you look carefully, you can see girls happily chatting and using their phones. Despite this, the video got thousands of retweets and racked up at least 6 million impressions. An analysis of the accounts sharing the video showed that most were based in India. It was even shared in the Telegram channel of Angry Saffron, an apparent open-source intelligence or OSINT channel operating from India. This suggests either sloppy intelligence or disinformation aimed at exploiting the credibility that the description “OSINT” might imply. In another instance, a video circulated that falsely claimed to show Hamas kidnapping a Jewish baby. The video garnered more than a million views in one post alone. Seven of the top 10 most-shared tweets featuring the misleading video were profiles based in India or containing the Indian flag in their biography. These seven tweets alone received more than 3 million impressions on X. However, the video was from September and had nothing to do with kidnapping or indeed with Gaza. Many of the accounts sharing these false videos also spend a lot of their time posting anti-Muslim comments on X. One account, Mr Sinha_, who shared the false video of a boy being beheaded by Hamas, included the hashtag #IslamIsTheProblem in the same post. Another account that shared the misleading video of Palestinians kidnapping sex slaves had previously written: “The only difference is when Muslim girls convert to Hinduism they live happily ever after. But when Hindu girls convert to Islam they end up in a suitcase or a fridge.” Others have been more explicit in their hatred of Palestine. One Indian account, purporting to belong to a retired Indian soldier, stated, “Israel must finish off Palestine from the planet.” It is no secret that India has an Islamophobia problem, one thathas only increasedsince the rise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A report by the Australia-based Islamic Council of Victoria found that the majority of all Islamophobic tweets can be traced back to India. The plight of Palestinians has drawn Islamophobes like moths to a light and this can be witnessed on social media. Part of this online hatred can be traced to what has been called the “BJP’s IT Cell”, who have fanned the flames of hatred. In her book, I Am a Troll, Swati Chaturvedi discusses the BJP’s online social media army. According to Sadhavi Khosla, one of Chaturvedi’s interviewees, “The BJP has a network of volunteers who take instructions from the social media cell, and two affiliated organisations, to troll critical voices.” Khosla said she left the “IT Cell” after tiring of the constant barrage of “misogyny, Islamophobia and hatred” she had to disseminate. While the BJP’s IT Cell may have an Islamophobia problem, it also has a disinformation problem, and it is coming to the conflict in Gaza Pratik Sinha, a co-founder and editor of the Indian non-profit fact-checking website AltNews, tweeted: “With India now exporting its disinformation actors in the Indian mainstream media and on social media in support of Israel, hopefully the world will now realise how the Indian right-wing has made India the disinformation capital of the world”. Elon Musk’s acquisition of X and his decision to scale back efforts to curb lies spread on the platform has potentially set a precedent that might be influencing other technology giants in their approach towards managing harmful content. Notably, companies like Meta and YouTube appear to be re-evaluating their existing commitments to mitigating hate speech, disinformation and other detrimental content on their platforms. Last week, the European Union even sent a warning to Musk following the deluge of disinformation on X following the Hamas attack on Israel. Western support of Israel, Big Tech’s renewed indifference to content moderation and the digital reach of right-wing Islamophobic accounts from India are turning the Gaza crisis into a springboard of hate targeted at Palestinians and Muslims.

The Middle East abounds in tales of spirits and their antics. Today, Al Jazeera brings some of these tales to life. Myths and legends, whispered under the veil of night from elder to child, offer glimpses into a culture’s most profound fears, dreams, and values. In Iraq, the enigmatic Marshes resonate with tales of theTantal, an elusive creature that can shape-shift – from man to beast to inanimate object. It is the essence of mischief, a trickster that delights in its trickery. Imagine encountering a stranger in the Marshes, adorned in flashy, seemingly tasteless attire. This stranger, possibly a Tantal in disguise, might pose a peculiar question: “Do you think these clothes would suit you?” Your answer holds weight. Admire his choice, and he may not only befriend you but also shower wealth upon you. Disapprove, and you risk the creature’s wrath, which could spiral you into madness. Marsh dwellers will tell you the Tantal is a creature of the night, a guardian of hidden marshland treasures and a malevolent spirit quick to ensnare the unwary, especially children. Visually, the unadorned Tantal is unsettling – with eyes oriented vertically like a cat’s and strikingly long, sharp canine teeth in an ambiguous “face” that hovers over a giant’s body that shuffles along, loose-limbed and terrifying. Of course, it often appears disguised as another creature – a man, woman, child, cat, or dog – when it is out and about to ensnare the unwary. Tales of the Tantal were also cautionary tales as grown-ups told children of the Tantal’s wrath, of how it could pull the defiant deep into watery graves. Tantals take their names from the names of theMarshes– among the most famous names known in Iraqi folklore are Tantal Abu Ghraib, Tantal Umm al-Ubaid, Tantal Abu Asmej, Tantal Dawar, Tantal Salin, and Tantal Hafiz, who is considered the ruler of many Tantals in the Marshes. The Tantal goes back to the legend of Hafiz himself, which was passed down from generation to generation among the clans of southern Iraq. The legend says that in ancient times there were two great kingdoms in southern Mesopotamia, ruled over by two kings, Al-Akr and Abu Shadhar, who had a brother named Hafiz. Life flourished in the two kingdoms, and the kings built ornate cities and temples with arched arcades and splendid balconies that looked over lush palm and fruit orchards the kings had ordered the planting of. And they had huge fences built around their kingdoms to protect them from flooding from the Marshes. They felt they had done everything they needed to ensure a safe kingdom and a happy populace. But the life of plenty and luxury meant they eventually strayed from the right path – they forgot God, forgot to dedicate their life to obeying the divine, and faltered in their worship. God’s anger was swift, and he sent an earthquake that largely destroyed the kingdoms, including the fences, and a flood that drowned what was left, till all that remained was ruins. Then God sent down Tantals and Jinn to guard the remains of these one-mighty kingdoms, which had been buried whole, with their treasures and delights. And that is what the Tantals have done. Through the centuries, they have used fear and trickery to keep people away from whatever buried treasure the Marshes hold. But if you were ever to get close to a Tantal, you would find that they have a gift: the power of foresight. Befriend it, and you may receive prophecies of the future. Yassir Kareem, an Iraqi filmmaker, once interviewed an elderly man from the Marshes. The man firmly believed the Tantal had visited him in a dream, predicting a future where the land would parch, and outsiders would claim it, forcing the native inhabitants away. This was a prophecy, he said, given the climate change that dried out the Marshes and the foreign oil companies that flooded into the oil-rich regions of Iraq.

Recognizing this resilience, and acknowledging the challenges posed by global climate change, Rutgers scientists have come to their assistance.One of the results of recent efforts is a guide that researchers have developed for marine businesses,A Resilience Checklist for New Jersey's Commercial Fishing Industry.Lisa Auermuller, director of the Megalopolitan Coastal Transformation Hub, which is based in the Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences in the Rutgers School of Environmental and Biological Sciences (SEBS), worked with a number of Rutgers scientists on the effort, including Douglas Zemeckis, a marine extension agent, and Eleanor Bochenek, the retired director of the Fisheries Cooperative Center, and Richard Lathrop, director of Rutgers Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis.Auermuller explained the overall endeavor.What aspects of climate change have most affected New Jersey shore's commercial fisheries? Are there economic repercussions?In New Jersey, coastal fishing communities from small villages to large ports are seeing increased regular flooding, coastal storms, sea level rise and shifts in the populations of their catches. These working waterfronts are on the front lines of these impacts, experiencing damage to infrastructure and disruption to the transportation of the catch.In addition, as ocean waters warm, the range of many marine species is shifting. For example, over the past 50 years, the fall range of the summer flounder, a commercially lucrative variety, has shifted 72 miles north, shrunk in size overall by 99 total miles and descended about 22 feet. Changes in fish populations require commercial fishers to adapt in how they make a living.This affects all of us. The New Jersey commercial fishing industry brings in an estimated $4.5 billion annually from fisheries, aquaculture andrecreational fishing. If the industry is adversely impacted, so is the state's economy.How can scientists help those engaged in the commercial fishing industry to weather the effects of climate change?The Rutgers team worked with fisheries resource managers and commercial fishing industry stakeholders from the diverse ports of Belford, Barnegat Light, Cape May and Port Norris to develop the Resilience Checklist.This checklist helps commercial fishers and businesses identify opportunities to improve resilience to storms and other coastal hazards, as well as changes in the productivity and distribution of fish populations. Each section includesonline resourcesthat can be used to learn more and develop solutions to improve resilience.Although it can be used individually by onebusinessor fisher, the checklist is most effective when completed collaboratively by several fishing businesses or fishers from a New Jersey port or dock. The purpose of the checklist is to start conversation and coordination among dock managers, fishers, processors, dealers and others involved in the industry about planning and preparation to address vulnerabilities. The overall resilience of a port or dock depends on the ability of each member of its fishing community to assess and address risks.How can planning and preparation, as advised in the checklist, make a difference?Commercial fishing communities know, perhaps better than many others, that storms, floods and shoreline erosion are a natural part of living and working on the coast. Coastal hazards can damage assets, disrupt business and cause financial loss. Climate change threatens to increase the intensity and frequency of coastal hazards and changes in the fish population. Knowing that these challenges have impacted fishing businesses in the past—and will continue to cause impacts in the future—highlights the importance of planning and preparation to improve resilience.Even if a fishing vessel is unaffected by floods, the fishing business could suffer if flooding damages or prevents access to land-based infrastructure. This includes boat ramps, docks, processing facilities and vendors operating restaurants, many of which were destroyed by Superstorm Sandy. Businesses that are prepared to respond to coastal hazards can more quickly resume operations during or after a coastal hazard event. Proactively planning for recovery allows a business to implement actions and ""bounce forward"" by rebuilding in stronger, smarter, safer and more resilient ways.What happens next?Since the 1600s, New Jersey's fishing industry has continuously adapted to change. In the face of challenges on land and water, fromcoastal stormsto species shifts, commercial fisheries are resilient because they must be to survive.The checklist has been distributed to commercial fisheries, ports, docks and fisheries scientists and managers. Rutgers scientists also developed aninteractive story mapto guide checklist users as they assess coastal flooding threats via Rutgers'NJFloodMapper tool. Owners of the state's commercial fishing businesses now have a guided way to reflect on steps they have already taken to be resilient and to identify opportunities to further prepare for current and future risks.Provided byRutgers UniversityCitation: Q&A: Scientist helps fish harvesters implement adaptive strategies to climate change (2023, October 19) retrieved 3 November 2023 ","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",gb,False,False

But across five continents this year, it's also unleashed a different kind of disaster: deadly flooding.Cities around the world have seen record rainfall 139 times in 2023. A rare hurricane-like storm inundated Libya last month, killing thousands. More than 100 people died across Asia during an intense monsoon season in July. After fatal floods pummeled the U.S. Northeast over the summer,torrential rainsparalyzed New York City last week.Soaring temperatures were at the root of all these weather calamities. June, July and August were the hottest ever for that period. Higher air temperatures mean the atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall, while record-hot oceans provide fuel for storms. And as the climate warms, flooding is poised to get worse.""We are now seeing record-smashing ocean temperatures, record-smashing global temperatures and record-smashing floods,"" said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center. ""It's all connected.""In the U.S., two major flood events this year—in California from January to March and the Northeast in July—killed 32 people and caused $6.7 billion in damages, according to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information. The damages are the highest since 2019, when accounting only for flood incidents totaling more than $1 billion.Global damages are difficult to tally because not all countries keep accurate records, but flood events have left more than 17,000 people dead or missing in 2023. On average, there were 216 floods or landslides worldwide per year from 2019 to 2022, compared with an average of 160 over the previous four years, according to the International Disaster Database.In large part, the ever-worsening downpours are caused by what scientists call a ""positive feedback loop.""It works like this: The Earth's temperature rises in response to greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Hotter air holds morewater vapor, which then absorbs heat and prevents it from escaping the atmosphere—resulting in even more moisture in the air and heavier rainfall.Water vapor ""traps yet more heat and sets up a vicious cycle,"" Francis said.As the atmosphere gets warmer, so have the world's oceans. Higher water temperatures heat up the air above the sea surface, generating energy for hurricanes andtropical stormsto form. The Atlantic saw 10 storms develop from Aug. 20 to Sept. 16, the most on record for that period, according to Phil Klotzbach, a Colorado State University hurricane researcher.The storm that devastated Libya last month was a ""medicane,"" a name that's an amalgamation of Mediterranean and hurricane. Theseweather systemsare smaller than large Atlantic storms but can strike with Category 1 force on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, bringing winds greater than 74 miles per hour and flooding rains.Warmer water temperatures lead ""to a lot of evaporation from the oceans and more moisture in the atmosphere, and that provides the fuel for more rainfall in general,"" said Robert Adler, a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland. ""There is not much doubt that global warming in general is pushing us toward more intense rainfall events.""The total amount of rain that falls on Earth has only increased a small amount as the climate evolves, but what's changed is the intensity, Alder said.In the past, a hypothetical city may have seen 10 storms per month, each bringing an inch of rain. Now, a singlestormcan drop 10 inches of rain, overwhelming streets, drains and buildings that weren't constructed to handle that kind of deluge.""All the storms today can tap into that extra moisture, produce more rain, and increase the chances of flooding,"" Francis said. ""Water vapor is rocket fuel for storms—more of it means they can strengthen faster and become more intense.""Amplifying ocean heat this year is the weather pattern know as El Niño, which warms the equatorial Pacific's surface.Of course, this year's extreme weather hasn't been confined to flooding: Much of the world remains under dry conditions. A massive heat wave taxed energy grids across Texas and Mexico over the summer, throwing the U.S. Great Plains and Midwest deep into drought. But the increased frequency of both drought and flooding is evidence of global warming, said Lou Gritzo, chief science officer and staff senior vice president at commercial property insurer FM Global.""These things are not unrelated,"" Gritzo said. ""We are seeing exactly what we would expect to see in a changing climate.""How people use the land also can affect the severity of floods, said Deborah Brosnan, a climate scientist and founder of environmental risk consultancy Deborah Brosnan & Associates.In Libya, deforestation, unhealthy or depleted soil and poorly maintained dams all helped turn an extreme weather event into a human catastrophe, Brosnan said.But the risks aren't confined to developing nations. Climate change combined with urbanization all over the globe means higher rainfall, more pavement and fewer places for all that water to go when it hits the ground.""There is no area that is immune to this,"" Gritzo said. ""There is not a single continent that we can point to and say, 'This is not going to happen there.""'2023 Bloomberg News.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Citation: Record heat unleashes deadly floods from New York to Libya (2023, October 9) retrieved 3 November 2023 ","['libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'us', 'mexico']",gb,False,False

The aftermath of the disaster on September 10-11 has seen the rival camps in the east and west of the war-scarred country both announce their own plans for a reconstruction conference. The United Nations, Western governments and international observers warn that Libya's dysfunctional politics are hampering efforts to help the tens of thousands of displaced survivors rebuild their lives. The UN mission chief in Libya, Abdoulaye Bathily, stressed Monday that the competing efforts ""are counterproductive, deepen the existing divisions in the country (and) impede reconstruction efforts"". The United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy backed his call for ""a unified Libyan national mechanism"" coordinated with international partners ""to deliver transparent and accountable relief"". Claudia Gazzini of think-tank the International Crisis Group warned that Libya's two rival administrations might ""use this crisis in opportunistic ways"", including by possibly diverting funds. ""There are already signs of turf wars (and corresponding disinformation campaigns) between the rivals over who should take charge of reconstruction efforts,"" she warned. The humanitarian needs are enormous in the devastated eastern city of Derna, where a huge flash flood broke through two upstream dams and swept entire neighbourhoods into the Mediterranean, leaving behind an apocalyptic wasteland. Local authorities have declared a death toll of 3,845, but have yet to release an official figure of how many people remain missing -- a number international aid groups put at around 10,000 in the first days after the disaster. The scale of the destruction was blamed on the sheer volume of the rains brought by hurricane-strength Storm Daniel, and on the impact Libya's years of chaos have had on critical infrastructure, early-warning systems and emergency response. The oil-rich North African nation has been in turmoil ever since a 2011 NATO-backed popular uprising led to the overthrow and killing of longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi. Years of fighting followed involving myriad tribal militia, jihadists and foreign mercenaries as the country also became a gateway for Europe-bound irregular migrants, many of whom have suffered severe human rights abuses in Libya. Libya now remains split between two former battlefield enemies: a UN-backed government based in the capital Tripoli in the west, and the disaster-hit east, backed by military strongman Khalifa Haftar. Haftar is close to Russia and its Wagner mercenary group and to the oil-rich United Arab Emirates, which led the early disaster relief effort. After the flood, the eastern government was quick to invite the ""international community"" for a donor conference scheduled for October 10, an announcement met with scepticism abroad. It has since postponed the meeting until November 1. Eastern officials have also distributed cheques for aid and compensation to mayors of flood-hit municipalities, an effort documented in photos published online. The Libyan parliament, based in the major eastern city of Benghazi, meanwhile announced it had allocated 1.9 billion euros for reconstruction, without specifying how it would be spent. Illustrating the institutional chaos, it was Libya's western-based government that announced around 18 million euros in aid for flood-damaged schools in the east. US ambassador Richard Norland cautioned that ""the Libyans must establish the structures that bring authorities from across the country together to agree on priority expenditures and ensure funds are efficiently and properly allocated"". ""We urge Libyan authorities now to form such unified structures -- rather than launching separate efforts -- that represent the Libyan people without delay."" The UN's Bathily said that ""the Libyan people have expressed their concerns about arbitrary cost estimates and unilateral reconstruction initiatives announced without transparency and buy-in from all relevant authorities and stakeholders"". He urged ""a unified national mechanism"" to steer a speedy reconstruction effort ""based on a credible, independent and objective assessment of the damage and needs, professionally determined cost estimates, and transparent contracting and procurement processes."" More broadly, Bathily called for renewed efforts toward national unity and elections, stressing that ""the impact of Storm Daniel also underscores the imperative to expedite negotiations on breaking the political stalemate"".","['libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'unitedstates', 'unitedkingdom', 'france', 'germany', 'italy', 'russia', 'unitedarabemirates', 'us']",us,True,False

Extreme rainfall from hurricane-strength Storm Daniel caused two upstream dams to burst on September 10, sending flood waters that have been likened to a tsunami crashing through the middle of Derna. The deluge razed entire neighbourhoods, dividing the port city and sweeping many people into the Mediterranean and to their deaths. ""Derna, today, is broken in two. It's a reflection of what its inhabitants feel,"" said Mayssam Hasedi, who lost more than 20 relatives in the flash floods. More than 4,000 people have been reported dead and thousands more remain missing in eastern Libya, according to authorities. After days of clinging to the hope of finding survivors, Derna's inhabitants now despair watching the continuous arrival of lifeless bodies recovered at sea. ""Almost everyone in the city is in mourning and suffering,"" said Michel-Olivier Lacharite, the head of emergencies at the medical charity Doctors Without Borders. ""Some children refuse to drink water for fear of drowning,"" he said, after meeting flood survivors in Derna. ""Patients complained of flashbacks, of not being able to sleep between 2:30 am and 5:00 am -- the time when the deadly wave engulfed the city."" Last month's flood was the latest catastrophe to strike the oil-rich North African country that has been wracked by war and lawlessness since a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 ousted and killed longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi. The psychological impact of the disaster will also be felt for a long time among rescuers, especially divers who recovered hundreds of lifeless bodies, according to aid groups. The World Health Organization has said ""tremendous mental health needs are emerging, and will continue to emerge, as the initial shock of the devastation and loss they have experienced begins to dissipate."" The International Rescue Committee (IRC) on Tuesday warned of the ""immense psychological toll the emergency is taking on those affected, particularly in the city of Derna, one of the areas hardest-hit."" The aid group deployed medical teams on the ground after the disaster, including mental health professionals, to respond to the crisis. It says it is working with Libya's health ministry to establish a mental health unit. ""With entire neighbourhoods swept from the ground, taking care of the mental wellbeing of those affected must go hand in hand with providing basic services,"" said Elie Abouaoan, the IRC's Libya country director. Children, who are traumatised by displacement and the loss of their homes and loved ones, are particularly impacted. UNICEF's partners had ""reported several instances of suicides, withdrawal, lack of sleep, bed wetting... among children, especially in shelters"", said the United Nations children's agency. In addition, dozens of minors have become wards of the state after their families perished in the flood, authorities say. More than 42,000 people remain displaced, according to the latest figures from the International Organization for Migration. The authorities' priority now is the reconstruction of Derna, its buildings, and its bridges, but it must go hand in hand with the social and mental reconstruction of its traumatised inhabitants who need short and long-term support to accept and manage the unacceptable, according to specialists. As attention turns to rebuilding the destroyed city of Derna, experts say authorities must also pay attention to rebuilding the spirit of city's shattered community. International Medical Corps has announced agreements with Libyan authorities to provide medical follow-up and train medical personnel to provide psychological support to residents of Derna. But the extent of the devastation that struck the heart of the city has rendered most service infrastructures unusable, and the hospitals, at least those still standing, are no longer able to accommodate patients. But many of the city's medical facilities no longer stand, leaving Derna's traumatised residents few places to go to for psychological support.","['libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya']",us,False,False

I also welcome the participation of the Representative of Libya in this meeting. Firstly, I want to express the UK's deep condolences to the people of Libya following the devastating flooding in Derna. The UK is committed to supporting those affected by the flooding. We have mobilised over $6 million in support, contributing to the UN Flash Appeal, deploying UK emergency medical teams, and technical engineering support. We will continue to coordinate closely with the UN and Libyan authorities on further support required. We welcome SRSG Bathily's statement on the need for a national mechanism to direct recovery and reconstruction efforts. To be effective, any reconstruction efforts must be unified across eastern and western Libya, and coordinated with local, national and international partners. There must be full transparency, effective oversight, and accountability to the Libyan people. President, the devastating floods simply reinforce our assessment that the status quo is unsustainable and will not deliver what the Libyan people need. Libya's citizens continue to suffer from the lack of political progress. A unified and democratically-elected government is needed to respond effectively to citizen's needs. In this regard, we note UNSMIL's assessment that the updated electoral laws constitute a working basis to hold elections and require the commitment of all major parties to implement. However, as SRSG has made clear, contentious issues remain. These need to be resolved through an inclusive political agreement. Therefore, Libya's leaders must urgently engage with SRSG Bathily, in a constructive manner, to give this process a chance of success. They should attend any UN convened meetings and make concessions in order to move Libya towards elections. We look forward to working with Council Members on the renewal of the UNSMIL's mandate later this month. UNSMIL is an essential partner in Libya and vital to efforts to help create a path towards free, fair and inclusive Presidential and Parliamentary elections. We hope this renewal will provide the continuity that SRSG Bathily needs to lead the Mission and steer international support towards an inclusive political settlement for Libya.

U.N… [+2498 chars]",Libya,"CAIRO --The United Nations’ top official in divided Libya on Monday called for a unified mechanism to lead the reconstruction of a coastal city that was wrecked by devastating floods last month. U.N. Special Envoy for Libya Abdoulaye Bathily said in a statement that such a mechanism is required amid “unilateral and competing initiatives” by Libyan actors and institutions on the reconstruction of the Mediterranean city of Derna and other flood-impacted areas. Devastating rainfall and floods, triggered by Mediterranean Storm Danial, hit parts of eastern Libya last month. The floods overwhelmed two depleted dams outside Derna on Sep. 11, causing massive waters that washed away residential buildings to the sea and left as much as one-third of Derna’s housing and infrastructure damaged, according to the U.N.’s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Government officials and aid agencies have given estimated death tolls ranging from more than 4,000 to over 11,000. The bodies of many of the people killed still are under rubble or in the Mediterranean, according to search teams. As Libya remains divided, with two rival administrations claiming legitimacy and each wanting to oversee the reconstruction of Derna, Bathily called for “a unified national mechanism ... required to effectively and efficiently take forward the reconstruction efforts in the flood-affected areas.” He urged Libyan rival authorities and their international partners to facilitate the establishment of the unified mechanism to ensure “transparency and accountability.” Following the disaster, many in and outside Libya called for an international investigation, reflecting the deep public mistrust in state institutions. The two dams had not being maintained for decades despite repeated warnings that they were depleted. Bathily’s call for a unified mechanism quickly gained support from the U.S., the U.K.,France, Germany, andItaly. The five governments said in a joint statement that they “strongly support” a proposal to “deliver transparent and accountable relief and response to the reconstruction needs in the wake of the flood disaster.” The oil-rich North African nation has been in chaos since 2011, when an Arab Spring uprising, backed by NATO, ousted longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was later killed. For most of the past decade, rival administrations have claimed authority to lead Libya. The country’s east and south have been under the control of Gen. Khalifa Hifter and his self-styled Libyan National Army, which is allied with a parliament-confirmed government. A rival administration is based in the capital, Tripoli, and enjoys the support of most of the international community.","['libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'us', 'unitedkingdom', 'germany', 'not found']",us,True,False

There are three main accusations: Firstly, residents of Derna, the hardest-hit town, say they were told to stay at home rather than being evacuated even though it was known that Storm Daniel was coming. Secondly, local and regional authorities are accused of failing to address the danger posed by the dams on the Derna riverbed, which runs through the town. Two dams spanning the Derna valley inland from the city burst on 11 September, causing the catastrophic flooding. Finally, the authorities are accused of hindering the aid effort in the days immediately after the tragedy. Anger in Derna escalated into protests on 18 September and the home of the mayor - who later resigned - was subsequently burned down. The death toll remains unknown, with many bodies believed to have been washed out to sea. At least 4,000 people have been confirmed dead and another 10,000 reported missing in a town with a population of about 90,000. Since the fall of long-time Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, the country has been divided between a UN-backed government in the capital, Tripoli, and a rival authority backed by military strongman General Khalifa Haftar, whose forces control eastern Libya, including Derna. Ahead of the arrival of Storm Daniel, various bodies in the east held emergency meetings and subsequently issued instructions to the region's residents. These generally focused on the evacuation of coastal and low-lying areas in Derna, and stay-at-home orders for other parts of the city and wider region. But residents have told BBC Arabic that evacuation efforts were inadequate in a number of respects: Residents of the town were generally instructed to stay indoors. People living in specific areas on the seafront or close to the riverbed were ordered to leave their homes but there was no comprehensive or consistent list of areas to be evacuated. Local residents told the BBC that some people who were evacuated from the seafront because of fears of rising sea levels were moved to more dangerous areas that were later flooded. ""There were no warnings of possible flooding, just that the sea levels might rise,"" a local engineer told the BBC. ""Only those by the beach were asked to evacuate, but the rest of the city was asked to stay indoors."" The man, who has chosen to remain anonymous In fear of reprisal, lost his wife and two of his sons in the tragedy. He added that just a few hours before the flooding, a force from the interior ministry was going around asking people to stay indoors. ""Many of those that evacuated from the beaches went into central Derna, where they were killed by the later flooding,"" he said. Preparations actually began well in advance of the disaster. On 9 September - two days before the devastating flood - the eastern government convened an emergency committee meeting and declared the following two days national holidays to encourage people to stay at home. A curfew was declared in the region from 20:00 that evening and orders were given for the evacuation of ""areas near the sea and low-lying areas located in the valleys of Benghazi and the entire eastern region"". The announcements generally called for people to move to ""safe places"", without specifying where they should go. On the same day, the mayor of Derna made a similar call to evacuate various seafront and low-lying neighbourhoods. But by 10 September, online announcements and video statements posted by the Derna police had dropped any mention of evacuation, and were focusing on the curfew and making sure people stayed at home. Photos geolocated by the BBC show police patrols out on the roads following another official announcement which imposed a curfew ""inside the city as a precaution to prevent emergency, especially areas near the beach"". This proclamation came via a Facebook post, and many residents of Derna have complained that television and social media were insufficient means to alert people, especially given the disruption in the aftermath of Storm Daniel. Red Crescent staff were also active in coastal areas in the days ahead of the flood - videos show them calling on people via megaphone to clear their homes to stay safe from Storm Daniel. So notable efforts were made to move residents in some areas of the city, but all of these evacuations anticipated that the threat would come from rising sea levels, rather than the failure of infrastructure far inland and the Derna valley flooding. Derna residents reported hearing a loud blast before the city was engulfed - the failure of one or both of the two dams which had until then been holding back the floodwaters in the valley. The upper dam had a storage capacity of 1.5 million cubic metres of water, while the lower dam could hold 22.5 million cubic metres. Each cubic metre of water weighs about one tonne (1,000kg), so the water held back by the dams weighed a total of 24 million tonnes. As that weight moved downhill, it produced enormous power. Witnesses have said the water was nearly three metres high in places. Public pronouncements by officials in Derna or the eastern government made no reference to the potential overflow or collapse of the two dams serving the city, focusing instead on the dangers of strong winds and potentially rising water levels. Dr Abdulwanis Ashour, a hydrologist and lecturer at Omar Al-Mukhtar University, told the BBC he had collected data on the condition of the Derna dams for a study published last year, which showed they were not prepared to withstand a storm like Daniel. He said he had spent years studying the Derna dams and had discovered the presence of numerous cracks and fissures. In his research, he asserted that they would not be able to handle a large amount of rainfall and were at risk of collapse. Dr Ashour pointed out that studies and reports had been conducted by local and international entities over the years, all of which warned about the condition of the Derna dams and their danger to nearby areas. He affirmed that successive governments were aware of these reports. On Monday 25 September, Libya's Public Prosecutor's Office, part of the western government, ordered the arrest of 16 officials responsible for managing Libya's dams as part of investigations into negligence regarding dam maintenance and other flood-related work. But it is not clear if any of them have actually been arrested. The emergency response of the Derna authorities has also been widely criticised. In a rare sign of unity in the divided country, pleas for help from the stricken town were answered as a multitude of aid workers immediately set about delivering supplies from cities under the control of the rival government in the west. But these convoys were stopped and denied access into Derna. BBC Arabic has been told that this was due to tight security measures invoked immediately after the disaster by the eastern authorities, which led to delays in aid for thousands of survivors for days afterwards. ""Nothing and no-one gets in without their permission,"" one Libyan aid worker told the BBC. This aid worker - originally from Derna - lost several friends and relatives to the floods. They work for the Libyan Red Crescent - the only aid agency allowed to work in Derna in the early days of the crisis - and so were one of few aid workers granted access to the city from day one. ""Haftar and his troops only trust the Red Crescent, but we couldn't do much as the crisis was so big. We needed all the help we could get,"" said the aid worker, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, for fear of being targeted by Gen Haftar's troops. ""Haftar put security before rescue, and political differences before helping devastated Derna residents,"" the aid worker said, adding that Gen Haftar's forces denied immediate access to volunteers coming from western Libyaand halted delivery of aid supplies for days. They say that security forces spent hours scrutinising much-needed aid supplies looking for ""weapons that could be smuggled into the city"". Gen Haftar has been in control of Derna since 2018, but he only took it after Islamists linked to Islamic State had held out against his forces for three years. One local resident told the BBC he thought the city ""was still getting punished"" for this resistance. Whatever the motivation, Derna's residents were left for days with no food, clean water or medical supplies, while vital aid supplies were withheld and stored for inspection. It is impossible to know how many lives were lost as a result. The BBC also spoke to the leader of an aid convoy sent from the west of the country, who recounted a similar story. Abdel Monem Kheresha from Tripoli said his convoy was prevented from entering Derna. ""We were stopped before Derna's entrances and we were ordered by the 'Libyan National Army' [LNA, Gen Haftar's militia] to hand over our supplies,"" said Mr Kheresha. The BBC has found that aid supplies gathered from such convoys were stored in two main warehouses supervised by the LNA, one in Benghazi and the other in al-Marj. They were carefully inspected and then distributed by the LNA, an operation that took hours and even days. It wasn't until Thursday 14 September, when the size of the catastrophe was apparent to the whole world, that a long queue of trucks carrying aid from around the country was allowed into the city. Derna resident Al-No'man Ali told the BBC that they finally received food and aid supplies on the Friday after the disaster, after days of waiting. After the protests began on 18 September, many local and international journalists in the city were forced to leave after coming under pressure from the authorities. At the same time, communications in the city went down - many protesters believe they were deliberately cut to stop the demonstrations from escalating. The lack of mobile phone signal and internet hindered the rescue and aid work in the city as the different international and local teams that were eventually allowed to operate there couldn't coordinate their work. The BBC has approached the east Libyan authorities for comment on those allegations, but has not received a response.

New data shows last month was the hottest September – thefourthconsecutivemonthof such unprecedented heat – putting 2023 firmly on track to be the hottest year in recorded history. September beat the previous monthly record set in 2020 by a staggering 0.5 degrees Celsius, according to data released Wednesday by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. There has never been a month so abnormally hot since Copernicus’ records began in 1940. “The unprecedented temperatures for the time of year observed in September – following a record summer – have broken records by an extraordinary amount,” said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, in a statement. The world has just experienced the hottest summer on record -- by a significant margin September felt more like an abnormally hot July with an average global air temperature of 16.38 degrees Celsius (61.45 Fahrenheit), making the month 0.93 degrees Celsius hotter than the 1991 to 2020 average, and 1.75 degrees Celsius hotter than the September average for the pre-industrial era, before the world started burning large amounts of fossil fuels. That’s well above the1.5 degrees Celsius thresholdto which countries aim to limit global warming under the Paris Climate Agreement. While that agreement focuses on longterm average temperatures, September’s abnormal heat – which followed thehottest summer ever recorded– has given a preview of what the world can expect as soaring temperatures supercharge extreme weather. September alone brought devastating flooding thatkilled thousands in Libyaanddozens across Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey. Canada grappled with itsunprecedented wildfireseason, parts of South Americawere scorchedby record-breaking heat andrecord rainfalldeluged New York. Ocean temperatures were also off the charts in September. Average sea surface temperatures reached 20.92 degrees Celsius (69.66 Fahrenheit), the highest on record for September and the second-highest on record for any month, after August of this year. Antarctic sea ice also reached record lows for this time of year. “This month was, in my professional opinion as a climate scientist – absolutely gobsmackingly bananas,” Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist,posted on X(formerly Twitter) on Tuesday. Even in October, there is little sign of heat dying down. European countries, including Spain, Poland, Austria and France, have alreadybroken their all-time October temperature records, according to Maximiliano Herrera, a climatologist and weather historian who tracks extreme temperatures. What Europe experienced in the first three days of October was “one of the most extreme (climate) events in European history,” Herreraposted on Xon Tuesday. It now appears all but certain that this year will be the hottest year on record. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration puts the chances of reaching this milestoneat more than 93%. The extreme September “has pushed 2023 into the dubious honor of first place – on track to be the warmest year and around 1.4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial average temperatures,” Burgess said. 'Not nearly enough.' IEA says fossil fuel demand will peak soon but urges faster action The high temperatures have been partially fueledby El Niño, the natural climate pattern that originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean and has a warming effect. But underlying that pattern is the longterm trend of human-caused climate change. “Temperature records continue to be broken because we have not stopped burning fossil fuels. It is that simple,” said Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment in the UK. The significant margin by which heat records are being broken matters, she told CNN. “People and ecosystems are dying.” Countries will gather in Dubai for the United Nations COP28 climate summit in December where they will assess progress towards climate goals. The world is currentlya long way off track, according to a recent report. “The significant margin by which the September record was broken should be a wake-up call for policymakers and negotiators ahead of COP28,” Otto said, “we absolutely must agree to phase out fossil fuels.”","['not found', 'not found', 'greece', 'bulgaria', 'turkey', 'canada', 'unitedstates', 'spain', 'poland', 'austria', 'france', 'uk', 'unitedarabemirates']",us,True,False

It's a reflection of what its inhabitants feel,"" said Mayssam Hasedi, who lost more than 20 relatives in the flash floods.More than 4,000 people have been reported dead and thousands more remain missing in eastern Libya, according to authorities.After days of clinging to the hope of finding survivors, Derna's inhabitants now despair watching the continuous arrival of lifeless bodies recovered at sea.""Almost everyone in the city is in mourning and suffering,"" said Michel-Olivier Lacharite, the head of emergencies at the medical charity Doctors Without Borders.""Some children refuse to drink water for fear of drowning,"" he said, after meeting flood survivors in Derna.""Patients complained of flashbacks, of not being able to sleep between 2:30 am and 5:00 am -- the time when the deadly wave engulfed the city.""Last month's flood was the latest catastrophe to strike the oil-rich North African country that has been wracked by war and lawlessness since a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 ousted and killed longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi.The psychological impact of the disaster will also be felt for a long time among rescuers, especially divers who recovered hundreds of lifeless bodies, according to aid groups.The World Health Organization has said ""tremendous mental health needs are emerging, and will continue to emerge, as the initial shock of the devastation and loss they have experienced begins to dissipate.""The International Rescue Committee (IRC) on Tuesday warned of the ""immense psychological toll the emergency is taking on those affected, particularly in the city of Derna, one of the areas hardest-hit.""The aid group deployed medical teams on the ground after the disaster, including mental health professionals, to respond to the crisis.It says it is working with Libya's health ministry to establish a mental health unit.""With entire neighbourhoods swept from the ground, taking care of the mental wellbeing of those affected must go hand in hand with providing basic services,"" said Elie Abouaoan, the IRC's Libya country director.Children, who are traumatised by displacement and the loss of their homes and loved ones, are particularly impacted.UNICEF's partners had ""reported several instances of suicides, withdrawal, lack of sleep, bed wetting... among children, especially in shelters"", said the United Nations children's agency.In addition, dozens of minors have become wards of the state after their families perished in the flood, authorities say.More than 42,000 people remain displaced, according to the latest figures from the International Organization for Migration.The authorities' priority now is the reconstruction of Derna, its buildings, and its bridges, but it must go hand in hand with the social and mental reconstruction of its traumatised inhabitants who need short and long-term support to accept and manage the unacceptable, according to specialists.As attention turns to rebuilding the destroyed city of Derna, experts say authorities must also pay attention to rebuilding the spirit of city's shattered community.International Medical Corps has announced agreements with Libyan authorities to provide medical follow-up and train medical personnel to provide psychological support to residents of Derna.But the extent of the devastation that struck the heart of the city has rendered most service infrastructures unusable, and the hospitals, at least those still standing, are no longer able to accommodate patients.But many of the city's medical facilities no longer stand, leaving Derna's traumatised residents few places to go to for psychological support.","['libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya']",in,False,False

Luxembourg, October, 23 2023- In the context of Destination Earth (DestinE) ambitious initiative of the European Union, the Luxembourg Space Agency (LSA) has been supporting since early 2023 Thales Alenia Space (Joint Venture between Thales 67 % and Leonardo 33 %) and their Partners, the Luxembourg Institute of Sciences and Technologies (LIST) and PricewaterhouseCoopers Luxembourg (PwC) in their initiative to develop a Proof of Concept of a flood prediction Digital Twin. The project is funded by the Government of Luxembourg through an ESA Contract in the Luxembourg National Space Programme, LuxIMPULSE. Using innovative Earth system models, data sources and technologies, Digital Twins are developed with the ultimate objective to allow a large variety of users to explore the effects of climate change on the different components of the Earth system, and to assess possible adaptation and mitigation strategies. Several structural institutional initiatives in this area exist in Europe like Destination Earth funded by the European Commission or ESA Digital Twin Earth, funded by a large number of ESA Member States. The ultimate goal of these initiatives is to create a digital model of the Earth that will be used to monitor the effects of natural and human activity on our planet, anticipate extreme events and adapt policies to climate-related challenges. The national initiative by Thales Alenia Space in Luxembourg could at the end contribute to this goal by integrating a new regionally developed component to the flood prediction Digital Twin Earth. © ESA The Proof of Concept Digital Twin Earth prototype will be presented to the community in order to get their feedback and brainstorm together on the added value it can bring to their activities as well as on evolutions they imagine for next steps. Water flooding has recently caused enormous damages across Luxembourg. With this Proof of Concept, Thales Alenia Space Digital Center of Excellence in Luxembourg and their partners intend to demonstrate the benefits of a Digital Twin of the Earth applied to flood management: flood inundation forecasting, and impact assessment and prediction. Since its creation on September 2021, Thales Alenia Space in Luxembourg focuses on the development of state-of-the-art digital solutions for all space Domains : communications, observation, and navigation exploration. It leverages big data, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity technologies to address complex end-to-end satellites systems' challenges, while fostering user experience excellence. ""We are proud to lead this Flooding Digital Twin Earth initiative which is perfectly on line with our moto ""Space for life"", declared Etienne Barritault, General Manager of Thales Alenia Space in Luxembourg. Thales Alenia Space' competences will create the foundation of the data infrastructure and orchestration necessary to efficiently operate the PoC Digital Twin system. A large amount of data streams will need to be extracted, transformed and loaded for the simulation model used in calculating the predictions to work correctly. To make the system attractive to a variety of end-users additional attention is given to topics such as cybersecurity, scalability, performance and cost-efficient deployment. LIST bring their experience and expertise in satellite-based flood detection and forecasting, AI, data management and visual analytics for decision support and provides advanced capacities in data visualization and high performance computing. ""With our algorithms we have recently contributed to the successful launch of the first satellite-based global flood monitoring system. The proof-of-concept study gives us the opportunity to develop and test technologies that enable the reduction of uncertainties of flood forecasts using satellite data"", said Patrick Matgen, the responsible of the remote sensing group at LIST. PWC is animating the community of potential users in Luxembourg, evaluating their needs per segment. While some users are interested in short term prediction and risk assessment, others are interested in long term impacts of global trends such as global warming on flooding. ""This regional flood twin is a great twofold opportunity for Luxembourg: build a new level of expertise and solutions to prevent adverse climate events and build a world class ecosystem to meet large international opportunities"" said Laurent Probst, Partner, PwC Luxembourg. ""Digital Twins of the Earth are set to revolutionize the way we predict and react to natural catastrophes and climate change. LSA is enthusiastic about supporting this initiative, a perfect intersection between digital and space for the benefit of Earth"" said Alessandro Grasso, Project Manager for Earth Observation at LSA.

Cars were swept away as the River Bisenzio flooded and people climbed on roofs to escape the deluge. Hospitals were flooded, people in cars were trapped in underpasses and the west coast was lashed by high waves. The extreme conditions are directly linked to Storm Ciarán which has caused more than 13 deaths in Western Europe. Winds of 207km/h (129 mph) were recorded earlier on the north-west coast of France, as the storm also lashed southern England, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, as well as the Atlantic coast of Spain and Portugal. Power lines went down and transport was severely disrupted. A five-year-old child was one of two people killed in Belgium by falling trees. Residents had to be evacuated from their homes on the Channel Island of Jersey. A cold front of severe weather reached Tuscany on Thursday night, as winds reached 140km/h. Regional governor Eugenio Giani described the heavy rain as ""unprecedented in the past 100 years and, after a cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni declared a state of emergency for the worst-hit areas of Tuscany. Livorno and Marina di Pisa on the coast and towns around Florence were among the worst affected areas, with the streets of Prato looking more like canals and nearby Seano resembling an island. In Montemurlo, officials said on Friday that 200mm (7.8in) of rain had fallen since Thursday afternoon and the Bisenzio river burst its banks in two places. An 85-year-old man was found dead on the ground floor of his flooded home. Rescuers believe he had been unable to climb the stairs to safety. The governor of Tuscany shared a video showing cars being swept away by floodwater and appealed for people to go to upper floors. Close to the river, in Campi Bisenzio, people climbed on to their roofs to get to safety and about 100 staff and customers sought refuge in a shopping centre. A man and his wife were found dead after his car overturned in floodwater in Vinci, to the west of Florence. There had been fears that the River Arno would flood in Florence but the emergency appeared to have subsided by mid-morning. The mayor of Prato, Matteo Biffoni, described overnight events as a ""blow to the stomach"". Floods left entire areas submerged and the ground floor of the town's Santo Stefano hospital was partially flooded. The west coast was lashed by waves reaching 3.5m (11ft 5in), and Milan was hit by flooding for a second time this week, three days after the River Seveso burst its banks. The storm also caused damage in the north-eastern region of Veneto, where one person was missing and Governor Luca Zaia said 160mm of rain had fallen in 24 hours. Further east, there were red weather alerts in Slovenia and Croatia. Forecasters warned of high winds, hail and thunderstorms and authorities in Slovenia warned of one of the strongest cyclones in the past 10 years.

But extreme weather blamed on climate change has ruined his harvest.""Production has fallen by 80 percent,"" said the 43-year-old farmer from Sabina, north of Rome, despondently holding up a branch with only a few shriveled green and black olives on it.Known since Roman times for itsolive groves, this region boasts trees said to be hundreds, even thousands, of years old.But changing weather patterns are proving hugely challenging.""For several years, our land has really suffered fromclimate change,"" Risolo told AFP, citing torrential rain contrasted with ""long periods of heat lasting into the autumn"".Normally, he and his workers would be in coats for the autumn harvest, when they use electric devices to shake the trees so the fruit falls onto tarpaulins below.Earlier this week they were collecting the olives while wearing T-shirts, as the thermostat hit 29 degrees Celsius (84 degrees Fahrenheit).The cut in production has affected not just Sabina, but most of the central and northern regions of Italy, the world's second-largest producer ofolive oilafter Spain.This year national production is estimated to be 290,000 metric tons, down from 315,000 in 2022 and the lowest figure in the last four years, according to agricultural association Coldiretti.The Sabina region has been known for its olive groves since Roman times, some of the trees here said to be hundreds, even thousands, of years old.More uncertain than everWhen harvested, Risolo's olives go to the ""OP Latium"" mill, where they and others from the area are washed, sorted and then crushed into a greenish paste from which the precious extra virgin oil is extracted.The smell is glorious, and the equipment is state-of-the-art. But all the technology in the world cannot squeeze oil from olives that don't exist.Agronomist Stefano Cifeca, who is responsible forquality controlon site, confirmed this year's meager harvest.""Unfortunately this year climate change meant that in April and May (the flowering months)... we hadheavy rainfallthat washed away the pollen,"" hindering fertilization and the development of olives, he said.Faced with increasingly hot summers and long periods without rain, Unaprol, the national association of olive oil producers, is calling for a national plan to help save water.Cifeca backs this idea at a local level, urging the creation of basins to collect water in winter that can then be reused when drought hits.Changing weather patterns are proving hugely challenging.Farmers here are used to tough times. In 2018, Risolo recalls, a frost wiped out his harvest.But he warned that agriculture faces ""a more uncertain future than ever, because we cannot accurately predict these changes in the climate"".Saved by the southThe stakes are high. Italy has 150 millionolive treesrepresenting three billion euros ($3.19 billion) in annual turnover and supporting 400,000 businesses, according to Coldiretti.The risk is that some farmers switch to other crops, although Cifeca insists this is not yet necessary.""Luckily the olive tree is a very robust plant that can adapt to changes in climate and different territories,"" he said.Despite thepoor performancein the center and north, Italian production this year was saved by its southern regions, both Puglia—which makes half of Italy's oil—and Calabria.Olives are processed to make olive oil at a mill in Palombara Sabina, Lazio.Farmers have also been helped by rising prices in theglobal marketfor olive oil, as production in Spain, which normally produces half of the world's supply, has also suffered.Production in Spain fell 34 percent compared to the average over the last four years, according to Coldiretti figures from September, due to a prolonged drought.But the rising prices are bad news for consumers—including in Italy, which consumes 15 percent of olive oil produced worldwide.","['italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'unitedstates', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'ukraine']",gb,False,False

Thousands of homes were left… [+3811 chars]",Weather,"Around 40 flood warnings remain in place across the UK in the aftermath of Storm Ciarán. Nearly 150,000 homes were left without power after the severe weather caused widespread flooding and damage. Jersey recorded hurricane-force gusts of more than 100mph (161km/h). While the worst of the weather is now over, rain and ""violent"" winds are forecast for some parts of the UK this weekend, though a ""risk to life"" warning has been downgraded in Wales. A yellow rain warning expired for north-eastern Scotland at 17:00 GMT on Friday. A separate warning for the entire south coast of England will come into effect from 05:00 until the end of the day on Saturday, with 30-40mm of rainfall possible in coastal areas. No deaths have so far been linked to the storm in the UK, but there have been at least 13 fatalities in mainland Europe. In Wales, a severe flood warning around the Kiln Park caravan site in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, was downgraded at 16:46 to a flood warning, after previously cautioning that there was a ""significant risk to life and disruption to the community is expected"". However, there are fears that the next high tide, just after 21:30 on Friday, could raise the near-record level of the River Ritec further, bringing additional disruption. The caravan site has been already been evacuated. Two separate flood alerts - meaning flooding is possible - are in place in Wales, with stwo more in Scotland. Some 38 English flood warnings - meaning flooding is expected - remain in force, largely across the south of the country, with a further 167 flood alerts stretching northwards, up to near Scarborough. By Friday afternoon, Ciarán was moving away from the UK. BBC Weather meteorologist Helen Willetts said the remains of the storm, in the North Sea, is now much weaker. She explained that it would will bring heavy, blustery showers but added that drier, sunnier spells can be expected in between. Ms Willetts continued: ""However, in eastern and north-east Scotland, the rain will be persistent and occasionally heavy. Then overnight and through tomorrow (Saturday), more rain will push across England and Wales, and possibly eastern Northern Ireland as the wind picks up in the south. ""So again, it's the rain that is likely to cause more flooding and disruption as the ground is already saturated from the record breaking rainfall we have already seen in parts this October."" Schools in Jersey - which saw some of Thursday's worst weather - remained closed for a second day on Friday and aim to reopen on Monday. Schools on the neighbouring islands of Guernsey and Alderney reopened on Friday, with the exception of the College of Further Education. Jersey's airport was expected to remain closed to commercial flights until at least early on Friday afternoon due to storm damage. Dozens of people on the island were evacuated to hotels overnight on Wednesday and locals were also hit by huge hailstones ""bigger than golf balls"". The Met Office described the Channel Islands as having endured ""supercell thunderstorms"". Locals also faced hurricane-force winds, Jersey Met confirmed. Forecaster Matt Winter told BBC Radio Jersey that eastern parts of the island were ""briefly"" affected by a tornado. A clip from St Clement in Jersey showed Jessica O'Reilly sleeping in bed alongside her baby when the sound of the ""weather bomb"" woke her - seconds before the window was blown inwards. She described the moment her ""motherly instinct"" kicked in, telling the BBC: ""We went up to bed and could hear the wind getting stronger and stronger, closer and closer. ""Something didn't seem right, then the windows just smashed in, I grabbed [my daughter] and got out the room. ""I think I just thought 'my baby's in danger, I need to get out' and ran down the stairs."" Student Kate Marsh told the BBC she was woken at 05:30 when the roof of her bedroom in Falmouth, Cornwall, entirely blew off and collapsed onto her. In Northern Ireland, a flooding recovery operation is under way in Newry and Newcastle following heavy rain earlier this week, while an emergency response continues in Downpatrick, Co Down. The Department for Infrastructure said it did not expect to be able to work to reduce the floodwater in Downpatrick until Friday, when river levels have dropped. A spokesperson for the department said rivers in some areas had reached record levels and remained very high. The damage caused by flooding in Downpatrick has ""ripped the heart out of the town"", a local businessman told the BBC. Elsewhere across the British Isles, roofs were blown off homes, some train lines completely ground to a halt and there were long queues around the Port of Dover, which shut earlier amid rough seas. Roughly 146,000 homes - mostly in the south of England - were left without power, and by 08:00 on Friday around 600 properties still had no electricity. A spokesperson for the Energy Networks Association (ENA) said: ""While difficult conditions remain, with violent winds forecast until the end of the day, teams from across the country are working together to continue to reconnect customers where it is safe to do so."" Some rail services remain disrupted, with LNER - the main train operator on the East Coast Main Line between London King's Cross and Edinburgh Waverley - advising passengers not to travel until Saturday, amid a significant number of expected delays and cancellations. Several other train operators, notably in Devon and Cornwall, also warned of disruption on Friday while debris from Storm Ciarán was cleared from the tracks, but normal service has resumed elsewhere. Meanwhile, a section of West Bay cliff in Dorset collapsed onto a beach after it was hit by huge waves. And in Leatherhead, Surrey, a local football club has been swamped by flood water, putting a home game on Saturday afternoon in major doubt. Western Europe has also been battered, with at least 13 deaths linked to the storm. France, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, Croatia and Slovenia were all hit, while in Belgium a five-year-old boy was killed by a falling branch in the town of Ghent. In the Italian region of Tuscany, six people lost their lives as a result of the severe conditions, with several others missing and a number of hospitals flooded. Specialists in flooding have suggested the UK needs to be more proactive when making plans to avert the impact of storms. Prof Hannah Cloke, who specialises in hydrology at the University of Reading, says building resilience to storms requires action when the ""going is good, and that can seem expensive and unnecessary to many people when the sun is shining"". Trevor Hoey, a professor of river science at Brunel University and director of the Centre for Flood Risk and Resilience, added that there is risk of being reactive and waiting ""until there has been a flood event and then we try to stop that event from occurring again in the same place in the future"". Experts say a warming atmosphere increases the chance of intense rainfall and storms. However, many factors contribute to extreme weather and it takes time for scientists to calculate how much impact climate change has had on particular events - if any. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

A committee of MPs had raised concerns over a lack of health services helping those hit by such ""shock events"". But the government said on Friday that extra emergency funding to support crisis-hit farmers was not needed. Farmers say the floods have taken a huge toll on their mental health and they have received little support. Lincolnshire grower Henry Moreton currently has 155 acres (0.6 sq km) of land under water at his 500-acre (2 sq km) farm near Woodhall Spa. The 50-year-old sixth-generation farmer estimates he has lost between £55,000 and £65,000 worth of oil seed rape, winter wheat and barley to flooding after Storm Babet hit last week. The father-of-one told the BBC: ""I'm a very glass-half-full chap all the time. I'm always optimistic, my wife says, but when I went up our farm road towards the river on Saturday morning I got as far as the pond and I just stopped and cried because I didn't know what to do. What do you do? ""I've never had the wind taken out of my sails like it. ""My wife was that worried she hid the shotgun cabinet keys. She only told me that yesterday. She said she had never seen me look like that."" In May, the UK Parliament's Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) committee published a report into rural mental health. It found that extreme weather events and animal health crises - including mass culls to control diseases like bird flu - left farmers, their workers and their vets dealing with mental health trauma with little support. It called on the government to provide dedicated emergency funding to ""enable local areas to quickly access more resources to respond to rural communities' mental health needs during and, crucially, after crisis events"". But, in a response published on Friday, the government said it would not allocate specific funding and that current levels of support were sufficient. It said guidance on the impact of flooding on mental health was provided on its website and that it worked with charities and organisations, such as the National Flood Forum, to support people at risk of flooding. A Defra spokesperson said the government was ""acutely aware of the impacts flooding and climate events can have on farmers, including on their mental health"". It added that Environment Agency teams were ""working hard on the ground to help people recover from Storm Babet and the current impacts being felt by Storm Ciarán"". It said it was also providing support through its rural business support scheme, the future farming resilience fund, to link up farmers with mental health service providers. But Sir Robert Goodwill, the Efra committee chair, said he was ""disappointed"" by the government's ""rejection of measures to support the specific and identifiable mental health needs of those who live in rural areas"". ""This was an opportunity to make significant changes which could greatly impact our rural communities. With this response the government demonstrates a worrying degree of complacency,"" he added. Mr Moreton said that with long waits at his local GP's surgery, he had few options for mental health support in the immediate aftermath of the flooding. Instead, he has depended on family and friends, already helping him after his father - ""my best friend and my work mate since I was nine"" - died from cancer 18 months ago. ""When he died I knew what to do, I just kept going. But when something happens like this (flooding) it's out of your control. I never felt like I ran into a brick wall like that before and there's no-one out here to talk to, apart from friends,"" Mr Moreton said. He said he felt the government ""did not really care about farmers"" but acknowledged more needed to reach out for help, saying: ""Farmers are our own worst enemy. We never want to admit we are weak and we are very good at saying we are absolutely fine when we're not.""

Our alliance has been tried, tested, and has thrived over eight decades. We've stood side by side in the most difficult times. And just a few blocks from the White House and Capitol Hill, I witnessed for myself how Australians and Americans continue to strengthen these bonds. I was honoured to become the first Head of Government to visit the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Headquarters. Australians have too often witnessed the devastation of natural disasters. Right now, we are seeing bushfires take an awful toll in parts of Queensland and New South Wales. That's why visiting FEMA was a priority for me as Prime Minister. I wanted to personally recognise the courage, skill and dedication of emergency management personnel who are critical to responding to natural disasters. Australia and the United States have a proud history of being there for each other when it really counts. The toughest of times bring out the best in our people. Through fires and floods, we have rallied behind each other, protecting lives and livelihoods in both countries. The United States didn't hesitate in our hour of need, sending significant firefighting support during the 2019-20 Black Summer bushfires. American firefighters Captain Ian McBeth, First Officer Paul Hudson and Flight Engineer Rick DeMorgan Jr lost their lives in the service of our nation, when their water-bombing aircraft crashed near Cooma. And, more recently, Australia was proud to provide a large firefighting air tanker to Idaho to assist in firefighting across six US states. This visit wasn't just a chance for me to say thank you - it was an opportunity to talk about how we can keep working together to build our expertise, which is critical to building resilience. Our communities are already experiencing the debilitating impacts of climate change, from wildfires in California to floods in Victoria and New South Wales. That's why, in May, Australia's National Emergency Management agreed strengthened arrangements with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These arrangements will increase collaboration to improve our emergency response, including through formal sharing of best practice, employee exchanges and other mutually beneficial programs across the full spectrum of natural disasters. We'll work together to find the best ways to make sure our people are informed and up-to-date during emergencies, and counter misinformation that can be so dangerous during times of crisis. This complements the Climate, Critical Minerals, and Clean Energy Transformation Compact I signed with President Biden, which will see Australia and the United States collaborate to address domestic and regional climate risks, including increasingly frequent extreme weather events. At a time of global uncertainty, working with our global partners and making Australia's voice heard is vital. Whether it is climate change, the economy, or inflation, being part of these conversations means Australia gets to shape the solutions in our best interests. Australia is always best served when we take a seat at the table. And as this fire season begins, affirming our ties with FEMA makes a difference. It's one of the ways we are ensuring that in the toughest times, Australia can access world-class information and expertise to boost our response. President Biden and I are proud to work together, keeping the friendship between our countries strong as we confront the challenges ahead. And I'm proud that Australians and Americans are working together on the ground every day, keeping our people safe and secure, and facing the future with confidence.

At least six people in Italy and one person in Albania were killed on Friday, bringing the storm’s death toll to 14 across Europe this week. Throughout the day, the storm brought more death and destruction as it moved eastward across the continent. In Albania, police said a motorist died when he lost control while driving a car, which slid and hit barriers. Many roads in the country were flooded, including in the capital, Tirana. Huge waves pummeled the Adriatic shores of the Balkans, and strong winds uprooted trees and ripped off roofs. Ferries connecting Croatia's islands with the coastline were halted. Italian Civil Protection authorities said that 200 millimeters (nearly eight inches) of rain fell in a three-hour period, from the coastal city of Livorno to the inland valley of Mugello, and caused riverbanks to overflow. Video showed at least a dozen cars getting swept away down a flooded road. Tuscany Gov. Eugenio Giani said that six people died in the storm, which dumped an amount of rainfall not recorded in the last 100 years. “There was a wave of water bombs without precedence,” Giani told Italian news channel Sky TG24. Climate scientists say human-induced climate change has led to heavier rainfall during storms like Ciarán, often resulting in more severe damage. “If the conditions are different than 20 years ago, it is obvious to everyone,'' Nello Musumeci, the government's minister for civil protection, told Sky TG24, noting that weather systems in Italy have become more tropical in nature. The dead in Tuscany included an 85-year-old man found in the flooded ground floor of his home near the city of Prato, north of Florence, and an 84-woman who died while trying to remove water from her home in the same area, according to Italian news agency ANSA. The other victims were a couple who had been missing near the town of Vinci and a person in Livorno province. Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera said Friday evening that the wife of the man whose body was found earlier in the town near Prato also perished. At least two people were missing Friday in Tuscany, along with an off-duty firefighter reported missing in the mountains of Veneto, north of Venice. Other regions were on high-alert and authorities warned that the storm was heading toward southern Italy. At least 48,000 utility customers were without electricity, Transport and Infrastructure Minister Matteo Salvini said. High-speed train service between Florence and Milan as well as along smaller rail lines in Tuscany were affected. Ciarán left at least seven people dead as it swept across Spain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany on Thursday. The storm devastated homes, caused travel mayhem and cut power to a vast number of people. As the storm pushed through, it flooded at least four hospitals, including in Pisa and Mugello. Throughout Tuscany, train lines and highways were disrupted and schools were closed. Hundreds of people were unable to get home, including about 150 stranded in Prato after a train line was suspended Thursday night. Around 40,000 people were without electricity on Friday. The mayor of Prato expressed shock at the force of the flood that devastated the city overnight. By early Friday, residents were working to clean the damage. “A blow to the stomach, a pain that brings tears. But even after an evening and night of devastation, we are pulling up our sleeves to clean and bring our city back to normality,’’ Mayor Matteo Biffoni posted on social media. Florence Mayor Dario Nardella told Sky TG24 that the Arno River, which runs through the center of the city, had reached the first level of alert, with the highest levels forecast for midday. Neither he nor the governor expected the river to overrun its banks. “The psychological fear is high, considering that tomorrow is the anniversary of the 1966 flood,” Nardella said, recalling a flood that killed 101 people and damaged or destroyed millions of artistic masterpieces and rare books. In Austria’s southern Carinthia province, which borders Italy and Slovenia, wind and heavy rain on Thursday night led to landslides, blocked roads and power cuts. About 1,600 households were without electricity early Friday, the Austria Press Agency reported. The storm receded in northern France and the Atlantic coast on Friday, but heavy rains continued in some regions as emergency workers cleared away debris from the day before. Meanwhile, Corsica in the Mediterranean faced unusually fierce winds Friday — up to 140 kph (87 mph) — and regions in the Pyrenees in the southwest were under flood warnings. More than a half-million French households remained without electricity for a second day, mainly in the western region of Brittany. Trains were halted in several areas and many roads remained closed. French President Emmanuel Macron traveled Friday to storm-ravaged areas of Brittany, and Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne was traveling to hard-hit areas of Normandy. ___ Geir Moulson in Berlin, Angela Charlton in Paris, Llazar Semini in Tirana, Albania, and Jovana Gec in Belgrade, Serbia, contributed to this report.","['italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'albania', 'albania', 'albania', 'albania', 'albania', 'croatia', 'spain', 'spain', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'belgium', 'netherlands', 'germany', 'germany', 'austria', 'austria', 'slovenia', 'not found', 'serbia', 'serbia']",us,False,False

The UK Met Office names storm… [+5767 chars]",world,"Storm Ciarán made landfall in south-west England and northern France overnight on November 1, with heavy rain and winds blowing up to180 kilometers per hour(108 mph).The UK Met Office names storms each winter season, which starts in early September, and has decided to name them after people working ""to keep people safe in times of severe weather"" for the duration of the 2023/24 winterstormseason. In this case, Ciarán is a tribute toCiarán Fearon, a Northern Irish civil servant working in flood monitoring.Storm Ciarán prompted amber and yellow weather warnings from the UK Met office and red weather warnings from Metéo France. High winds have disrupted travel, blocked roads and drains with debris and damaged overhead lines, leaving over a million people without electricity in both countries.Given how early Ciarán arrived in the winter storm season, trees are still in leaf and anchored in soil that is waterlogged from recent wet weather, putting many trees at risk of being uprooted.Flood warningswere issued across the south of the UK and some parts of the east coast as heavy rain has met with sodden ground and already swollen rivers.Storm Ciarán is anextra-tropical cyclone(in other words, a rotating storm which forms outside the tropics) and unusual among North Atlantic storms, which rarely produce both heavy rain and high winds over large areas.Low pressure in the eye of the cyclone deepened rapidly as it moved over the UK, dropping by more than 24 millibarsin 24 hoursto a near-record low of 953 millibars. This is what meteorologists call a bomb cyclone.Forming a sting jetOnly two events with similarly low pressure havebeen recordedthis far south in the UK. Satellite images taken the day before the storm hit suggested asting jet(a stream of air that can form within a storm and produce extremely intense winds over a very small area) was forming that could strike the north of France.Ciarán is the UK's third named storm in a winter storm season that is shaping up to be exceptionally turbulent. The first named storm was in September (Agnes), which is very early. And the UK also had a named storm in August 2023 (Antoni), which is highly unusual.Large parts of the UK saw twice the average amount of rainfall inOctobertoo, largely due to Storm Babet that flooded parts of the north of England and Scotland and left around100,000 people without electricity. In the lead up to Storm Ciarán, severe flood damage was reported inNewryin Northern Ireland andWexfordin Ireland.Why autumn 2023 has been so stormyThe succession of storms since August 2023 has been driven by an unusually strongjet streamthat has shifted further south than is typical for this time of year.The jet stream is a band of very strong wind high in the atmosphere that can extend across the Atlantic and bring storms to the UK. A stronger jet stream can make storms more powerful, and a more southerly position means that storms are warmer and carry more moisture and energy, making rapid intensification more likely.Similar conditions were present for Storm Babet, though Babet became cut off from the jet stream instead, causing it to stall over the UK. Such slow-moving storms can produce more persistent rainfall over one region and cause flooding and are predicted tobecome more commonin awarmer climate.The strength and position of the jet stream is related to the temperature difference between cold polar air and warmer sub-tropical air. The jet stream is stronger when this south-to-north temperature difference is greater.The boundary between polar and tropical air masses is further south than normal for this time of year due to anomalously warm sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic, coupled with anomalously cold conditions in the southeastern US. This has fueled successive storms over northern Europe.The unusual strength and position of the jet stream is probably a result of the positive phase of theEl Niño southern oscillation, a natural cycle in Earth's climate which brings higher sea surface temperatures to the western Pacific. El Niño also contributed to the UK's extremely wet and windy2013/14 winter seasonand oftencausesextremely low temperatures over North America and windy and wet conditions in Europe.More wet and windy conditions ahead?Winter storms that hit northern Europe will unleash heavier rainfall in future due to climate change, as warmer air holds more moisture. Scientists are less certain about how wind will differ in future storms, as the relevant processes, such as those causing changes in the jet stream, are more complicated.However,researchsuggests that storms which combinehigh windsand extreme rainfall, like Ciarán, will happen more often over northern Europe in future. This willcompound the risksof climate change as the effects of flooding and wind damage accumulate.Recent storms show that society has not adapted to worsening climate conditions. Reducinggreenhouse gas emissionswill mitigate risks from extreme weather. But national emission pledgescommit the world to more warmingand with it, more intense flooding and storm damage.Alongside drastically cutting emissions, countries must build more resilient infrastructure to adapt to a more turbulent climate. This will be costly, but far less costly than doing nothing.","['unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'france', 'france', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'unitedstates', 'not found', 'turkey', 'us']",gb,True,False

A bridge collapsed near the city of Pistoia, killing two people. Another person died in the town of Rosignano. ""Over 200 millimetres of rain have fallen in three hours,"" Luigi D'Angelo, who is leading the Civil Protection rescue efforts, told Sky TG24 television. The governor of Tuscany said there were challenging issues around two large rivers in the area, the Bisenzio, north of Florence, and the Ombrone, in the southern part of the region. ""The situation is problematic, the Arno river is expected to reach a peak around midday in Florence, but there are no particular worries about this if it stops raining,"" Governor Eugenio Giani said in an interview with RAI's Radio Anch'io. Patients from three separate hospitals had to be moved to other facilities and many buildings were seriously damaged, Giani added. The defence ministry was supporting rescue efforts sending helicopters, trucks and water pumps to the flood-hit areas, Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said in a statement. Italy's Civil Protection agency on Thursday issued a warning of heavy rains and strong winds in central and southern Italy, with a high alert ""red code"" for Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia in the north of the country, and a medium alert ""orange code"" for nine other regions. Another person went missing in the Veneto region, the local governor was quoted as saying by Sky TG24. Storm Ciaran, which follows on the heels of Storm Babet two weeks ago, was driven by a powerful jet stream that swept in from the Atlantic, unleashing heavy rain and furious winds that have already caused heavy flooding in Northern Ireland, parts of Britain, Belgium and France.","['italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'not found', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'belgium', 'france']",in,False,False

At least six people have been killed in central Tuscany when Storm Ciaran swept through Italy after causing chaos in more western parts of Europe. Tuscany Governor Eugenio Giani said that six people died as torrential rain fell from the coastal city of Livorno to the inland valley of Mugello on Friday and rivers burst their banks flooding towns and villages. The dead included two elderly people from the city of Prato, north of Florence, according to Italian news agency ANSA. One person was also killed in Albania after they lost control of the car they were driving, bringing the storm’s death toll across the continent to 14. Italian Civil Protection authorities said that 200 millimetres (nearly eight inches) of rain fell in three hours on Friday. Giani said it was the heaviest amount of rain recorded in the last 100 years. “There was a wave of water bombs without precedence,” Giani told Italian news channel Sky TG24. Climate scientists say human-induced climate change has led to heavier rainfall during storms like Ciaran, often resulting in more severe damage. “If the conditions are different than 20 years ago, it is obvious to everyone,” Nello Musumeci, the government’s minister for civil protection, told Sky TG24, noting that weather systems in Italy have become more tropical in nature. At one point there were concerns the River Arno could flood the historic city of Florence, but the high water point passed without major incident. About 190 people were forced to evacuate their homes, including 150 in Campi Bisenzio, where houses were inundated and parked cars half-submerged in the water. Resident Enza Carfagna told the Reuters news agency how her family rescued an elderly wheelchair-bound ground-floor neighbour, using a blanket to lift her up the stairs. “Last night, it didn’t seem like a big thing, there was very little rain. Then at about 9pm (20:00 GMT), we saw all this brown water coming and we went to get the lady,” she said. High-speed train services between Florence and Milan were suspended and with an estimated 48,000 people left without power, the Italian government declared a state of emergency. It allocated an initial 5 million euros ($5.4m) to help the worst-hit areas. Huge waves also pummelled the Adriatic shores of the Balkans, as strong winds uprooted trees and ripped off roofs. Ferry services connecting Croatia’s islands were suspended because of the weather. Storm Ciaran was driven by a powerful jet stream that swept in from the Atlantic, unleashing heavy rain and furious winds that have already caused heavy flooding in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. More than half a million French homes remained without electricity for a second day, mainly in the northwestern region of Brittany. Trains were halted in several areas and many roads remained closed. French President Emmanuel Macron visited storm-ravaged areas of Brittany on Friday while Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne went to hard-hit areas of Normandy.

Also badly affected were Newry, Kilkeel, Portadown and Templepatrick, with many roads closed and waterlogged fields a common sight. As the clean-up begins, we ask: is flooding becoming more common in Northern Ireland and what can we do about it? According to the Department for Infrastructure, 45,000 properties in Northern Ireland are at risk of flooding from rivers, sea or surface water. Flood Maps NI has a historical flooding overlay. There is also a climate change overlay, based on the best available predictions. All of that data feeds into planning and preparation for floods. Flood waters recede but recovery takes longer - cleaning houses, redecorating, claiming on insurance if you're lucky enough to have it and even trying to find somewhere else to live or operate a business. Northern Ireland's Flood Risk Management Plan talks about resistance and resilience. Resistance covers actions like installing floodgates. Resilience is ""bounce-back-ability"" - how easy your property is to clean and dry out. Neither of these is cheap and and when water is creeping in they will not be at the forefront of your mind. But resistance and resilience apply for councils and government departments too - they can supply sandbag banks in high-risk areas and organise their distribution in an emergency. They can provide information when flooding is expected and help when it happens. It's also about predicting where is at risk and what's needed if the worst happens. When you have more than two centuries of weather records, changes become much clearer. At Armagh Observatory, October 2023 has provided food for thought. According to the observatory's measurements, last month was the wettest month ever - breaking a record that had stood since 1870. Met Office records for Northern Ireland put last month fifth on the all-time list for the wettest Octobers. It's hard to say for definite but warmer air holds more moisture so a warmer atmosphere will produce more rain - to quote observatory director Prof Michael Burton: ""That's physics."" The atmosphere is warming, causing more rain, but human changes may also affect how likely flooding is. Perhaps property has been built on a floodplain. A river's course may have been altered, affecting where and how quickly the water flows. Northern Ireland is one of the least wooded parts of Europe, says the Woodland Trust - trees are nature's way of creating flood barriers and reducing soil erosion. People may point to farming and its impact on our environment. Yes, agriculture is the largest producer of greenhouse gases in Northern Ireland but farmers are also affected by extreme weather. If fields are flooded, that can hamper productivity and slow down planting or ploughing and tilling. The new Farm Support and Development programme includes emissions reduction, farming with nature, carbon benchmarking and increasing sustainability. Explained: The support available if your business floods In pictures: Floods cause havoc across Northern Ireland Watch: Rowing to the rescue of those trapped by floods It's difficult to point to one single event and say: 'That's climate change' - it's a cumulative effect. Data from the Armagh Observatory and weather stations all over Ireland has been analysed by researchers at the Icarus Climate Research Centre in Maynooth University. It found clear signals of climate change - an increase in both rainfall and rainfall intensity, and an average temperature rise in Ireland of 0.88C for every degree of warming on a global scale. Prof Conor Murphy said that in some areas temperatures were increasing at an even higher rate. In some places, winter rainfall intensity increased by as much as 20% and that, he said, meant an increased risk of flooding. Look at Newry - it has flood walls dating back to the 19th Century but the floodwater breached those this week. The Department of Infrastructure said it spent £22.7m on flood risk management projects in 2022-23. It said annual investment ""of at least £30m"" would provide a long-term solution, with £8m required for maintenance of existing flood management infrastructure. Just £3m was spent on that maintenance in each of the past two years. But that level of funding is not available in the 2023-24 budget ""when balanced against the need to deliver other essential public services"", so funding will therefore be directed where it has ""the most impact"". These are big-picture issues that can appear beyond our control - it probably felt that way for everyone affected by flooding this week. But modern climate change did not happen all at once - it happened one piece of coal, one felled tree, one uninformed choice at a time. Tackling it will also be a choice for all of us - how we travel, what waste we produce, how we use energy, plant trees, protect peatlands and use our consumer power to make a change.","['unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'ireland', 'ireland']",gb,True,True

The Met Office has extended a yellow warning for rain after Storm Ciarán brought flooding and damage. The Environment Agency (EA) said rivers would rise ""really quickly"" as the ground was already saturated by rain. It urged people to sign up to the EA's flood warning service and check their area. The Met Office warned: ""Flooding of a few homes and businesses is possible. ""Large waves may lead to dangerous conditions across some English Channel coastlines."" Clarissa Newell, from the Environment Agency in the South West, said: ""When the catchments are full of water like this it's really important to know that it will rise very quickly. ""You can think you're having a bit of rain then suddenly it's coming in through your door."" In this situation, she warned people turning off electricity and gas, and moving to safety, and ""bringing important documents with you"", was key. Bee Tucker, BBCSW broadcast meteorologist, said: ""Some places have had close to 50mm (2ins) of rain since the start of the month, almost a third of the average rainfall for November. ""Some of the heaviest showers could give 20mm (0.8in) of rain and some places could get all their monthly average rainfall by the end of play on Sunday."" Across the British Isles, the clean-up after Storm Ciarán continued on Saturday, after roofs were blown off homes and some train lines completely ground to a halt. In Hampshire, families in more than 18,000 homes headed into the weekend without water or experiencing low pressure after the storm led to a supply works being shut down. National Grid said on Saturday morning that all storm-related power cuts in Devon and Cornwall had been resolved, while Energy Networks Association (ENA) said nationally there were no outstanding outages. Most railway services had also resumed on Saturday but the GWR line between Liskeard and Looe is expected to remain closed throughout the day, the operator said, as a result of ""heavy rain and winds over the last 24 hours"". A bus replacement is operating and tickets for travel on Saturday can be used on Sunday. Meanwhile, Cornwall Council said work on the clean-up after Storm Ciarán would continue into the weekend, after its highway team responded to more than 400 incidents, with all fallen trees now cleared. Pondhu Primary School in St Austell, Cornwall, remained shut on Friday due to extensive flooding, with the school saying it needed time to ""dry and clean the building so the children can return safely"". Councillor Martyn Alvey, who responsible for the environment at Cornwall Council, said: ""Our next concern is surface water flooding that is possible as a result of the rain on saturated ground. ""I would say that every community that knows they have a vulnerability to flooding should be on alert. ""We are not going to have the same issue we had last weekend with spring tides locking in those coastal villages but some of them will still have trouble from the river that feeds through the village and into the sea.

By Subel Rai Bhandari for RFA 2023.11.03 -- Extreme heat causes the most significant mortality rate among all extreme weather events and hazards, with Asia bearing an exceptionally high burden, as the world warms faster than at any point in recorded history, U.N. agencies said in a report. Climate change threatens to reverse decades of health and well-being progress, especially in vulnerable communities, said the joint report ""State of Climate Services"" by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and World Health Organization (WHO). Between 2000 and 2019, estimated deaths due to heat were approximately 489,000 per year, with a particularly high burden - 45% - in Asia. Countries with limited early warning coverage, most of which were vulnerable Asian and African nations, experience disaster mortality rates eight times higher than those with an extensive range, the report said. Burmese construction worker Rajendra G, 40, works as a daily wage laborer at a construction site in Bangkok. During the summer, he said the workers were given breaks due to extreme heat. ""It was impossible to work outside, especially between 11 and 2. So, we started early, took a break during the day, and worked in the evening again,"" Rajendra, who declined to give his family name, told Radio Free Asia. ""Some of our friends fainted, but thank God, no one was seriously ill."" Rajendra G is one of the millions, including street vendors, cleaners, farmers, and other informal economy workers, who bore the brunt of the unprecedented heatwaves, with record-setting temperatures in most of Southeast Asia, China, and other parts of Asia this summer, as the world entered what U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called a period of ""global boiling."" Schools were shut down, and power grids struggled to cope as air conditioners were turned on full blast at homes, offices, and factories. In India, at least 170 people died, as hospitals and health systems in parts of the country, as well as in Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand, came under severe strain due to heatwave-related admissions. The World Weather Attribution (WWA), a group of global scientists, said that the heat wave in Southeast Asia was expected ""once in 200 years,"" which would have been nearly unthinkable without the influence of human-induced climate change. Scientists say the rising temperature is due to carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels and the emergence of El Niño, a climate phenomenon characterized by the periodic warming of the equatorial Pacific. ""Practically the whole planet has experienced heatwaves this year,"" WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said Thursday. ""The onset of El Niño in 2023 will greatly increase the likelihood of breaking temperature records further, triggering more extreme heat in many parts of the world and in the ocean - and making the challenge even greater."" Better climate health services needed The U.N.'s Thursday report, with input from 30 other partners, came as scientists said 2023 is most likely to be the warmest on record, as every month since June has been the hottest month for each respective month, as well as the highest daily average surface air temperature on July 6. Heatwaves also exacerbate air pollution, which rose to the fourth leading cause of global premature deaths in 2019, responsible for around 7 million annual fatalities, surpassing well-known risk factors such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and malnutrition. According to Joy Shumake-Guillemot, who leads the WHO/WMO Joint Office for climate and health, heatwave mortality could be 30 times higher than recorded, with just 54% of countries in the world receiving warnings that tell them how to protect their health during a heatwave. Changing climate conditions amplify the spread of climate-sensitive diseases, making dengue the world's fastest-spreading vector-borne disease and increasing the length of the malaria transmission season in Asia and Africa. The report emphasized the need for customized climate information and services to help the health sector deal with extreme weather, poor air quality, changing disease patterns, and food and water insecurity, citing limited access to scientific resources as a critical challenge. It said about three-quarters of national weather services supply climate data to the health sector. Yet, less than a quarter of health ministries use meteorological information for climate-related health monitoring. ""The climate crisis is a health crisis, driving more severe and unpredictable weather events, fuelling disease outbreaks, and contributing to higher rates of noncommunicable diseases,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. By 2030, there will be around 560 medium to large-scale disasters each year, roughly 1.5 per day, the report warned, emphasizing that nations lacking comprehensive early warning systems face an eightfold increase in disaster-related fatalities compared to those with robust coverage. The report highlighted global case studies demonstrating the tangible benefits of combining climate and health efforts. In Fiji, enhanced integrated risk monitoring and climate-informed early warning systems have helped people better prepare and respond to climatic changes, reducing morbidity and mortality from climate-sensitive diseases, said Shumake-Guillemot. In Myanmar, satellites help integrate climate and environmental data into health surveillance to issue early warnings for leptospirosis, a bacterial disease common in Southeast Asia, often undiagnosed, and associated with waterborne outbreaks following heavy rainfall and floods. The report also pointed to the development of an integrated early warning system for dengue in Vietnam of up to six months in advance, where there has been an increase of over 100% in the number of cases of dengue fever since 2000. In Laos, efforts to bolster vulnerable settlements provided clean water, sanitation, and health infrastructure to 130,000 people, while 189 villages received climate resilience and sustainable infrastructure training, including maintenance and land use guidance.

Nuala McCartan, whose family have had shops in the town for about 100 years, said recent events are ""heartbreaking"". Along with other business owners, she has called on officials to urgently provide businesses with financial support for flood losses and repairs. It comes after a number of towns in counties Down, Armagh and Antrim were impacted by heavy downpours this week. On Saturday, the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) urged people to avoid using the Lagan Towpath in Belfast due to flooding in parts. Pumping has now stopped in Downpatrick after floodwater was successfully cleared from the town centre, the department confirmed. However, the DfI said water levels in the River Quoile were still very high so remaining water could not freely discharge into it. Market Street and several roads in the area remain closed. ""As the River Quoile level continues to fall over coming days, flood water will then be able to drain into it and naturally recede,"" a statement said. Preparations for a ""substantial clean-up"" are also under way by council staff so the town centre can reopen to the public. Sandbags will also be removed and power-washing operations will commence on Sunday. On Saturday morning, Ms McCartan was evaluating the damage the floodwater has caused to her two shops in Downpatrick. She said they might get into one of the shops later, but thinks it is unlikely they will get into the other one. ""As far as I can see, we are still a foot of water up,"" she said. ""My stock is just floating about. ""It's very hard - we're a family business we've just been here for 100 years, almost - it's just heartbreaking."" Ms McCartan said the community and the emergency services have been helpful, but more is needed. ""The community are amazing - with offers of help - our phones haven't stopped - but there's so many won't get back in again,"" she said. ""We need help, we need help now - we need that man that signs the cheques. ""I haven't the money to put into my shop - £100,000 or £50,000, I haven't got it. ""I'm pleading: please help us."" Flooding has also caused disruption to the railway line between Portadown and Dundalk, which will be closed until further notice, Translink said. Bus substitution services will be in place for both local services and the Dublin to Belfast Enterprise service. After hours of pumping, the floodwater on Market Street in Downpatrick has been cleared. Drone surveys have been done to help the agencies plan. It has allowed the services to see that there's a substantial amount of oil floating on the surface of the water. What's been really striking is the sense of community in Downpatrick. There are offers of cups of tea and shop owners have gone out of their way to say to us journalists that we can use their bathroom or come in and sit down. There is a stand at the Civic Centre supplying hot drinks and soup to all those involved in the pumping operation too. People are helping each other in any way they can. Once all shop owners can get in past the sandbags piled four and more high in front of their premises to assess the damage, then the real clean-up begins. Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O'Neill called on Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris to provide funding for emergency relief efforts as well as financial support for businesses and people affected by the flooding. Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn also wrote to Mr Chris Heaton-Harris to ask what assistance the UK government could provide. ""The UK government has already announced support for households and businesses in England which have been affected by flooding and I would be grateful if you could promptly clarify whether Northern Ireland will receive similar support and what form this support will take,"" Mr Benn said. Director of Downpatrick and County Down Railway Jonathan King said damage to its buildings and stock may roll into hundreds of thousands of pounds. Some of the heritage engines and carriages, dating as far back as 1862, are irreplaceable, he told BBC News NI. They cannot yet assess the full damage as floodwater lingers around the museum's entrance. Sean Sealey is the manager of a pharmacy which was flooded in Downpatrick and has reopened for prescription services. ""The community has been amazing in helping us - we've been able to supply a full pharmaceutical service and nobody has been affected by it, as far as we know,"" he said. But Mr Sealey said he is devastated for other businesses that are unable to open. ""They need money now to help them rebuild,"" he added. ""If they're not here on the street, I'll be the only one standing. I won't have any footfall coming in and my trade will drop - I'm very worried."" Social Democratic and Labour Party assembly member Colin McGrath said that the remaining floodwater ""is exceptionally dirty"". ""There are branches, tyres and obviously sewage - it could be Sunday before anyone can really assess the damage in their businesses,"" he told BBC News NI. Downpatrick and Newry, in County Down, and Portadown, in County Armagh, are among the areas that have been worst affected by flooding. A number of homes in the Portadown area have been damaged by flooding in recent days, with roads closed and transport services disrupted. The Department for Communities is providing emergency £1,000 payments for domestic properties which have been flooded.

For 25 years, the Tres Hermanos Pozoleria in Acapulco, Mexico, served 64 litres a week of pozole: a rich, stomach-warming soup made of hominy corn. It was a favourite neighbourhood haunt. Customers would belly up to the modest, brown-and-white tiled counter to order a bowl of soup, before settling into the dining tables nearby. But on the morning of October 26, the Tres Hermanos Pozoleria disappeared. All that remained was its sign, inviting customers to a pile of rubble where tables and chairs once stood. The wreckage at the restaurant reflected thedevastation across the cityas a whole. Acapulco suffered a direct hit fromHurricane Otis, a Category 5 storm that left at least 46 dead and 58 missing. Just 16 hours before it made landfall, Otis was predicted to be a Category 1 storm, the lowest level on the five-tier scale. But the hurricane intensified rapidly, defying all forecasts. When it struck Acapulco, it brought sustained winds of 270 kilometres (165 miles) per hour. Flood waters rose, power lines tumbled and the coastal city’s steep cliffs crumbled into mudslides. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States has called Otis the strongest hurricane to strike the Eastern Pacific since the advent of satellite forecasting. “It was like a water tornado, spinning and eating things up,” said Lucia Transito, one of the owners of the Tres Hermanos Pozoleria. “We saw when everything was destroyed, but more than that, we heard it.” The rapid acceleration of the hurricane’s power, fuelled in part byclimate change, gave Acapulco residents little time to evacuate. Three generations of the Transito family live together in a small, two-story house behind the restaurant. There’s Lucia, her father Santiago, her mother Beatriz Transito, her husband and their baby daughter. On the night of October 25, they huddled together on the upper floor of their home, dodging pieces of window glass blown in by the wind. When their neighbourhood, La Rinconada, flooded, the mud downstairs reached as high as their thighs. It took three days for the family to clear out all the muck. Their home was one of more than 200,000 that suffered serious damage in Acapulco. But in the restaurant, the destruction was worse. Its corrugated metal roof lay twisted in pieces atop a nest of debris: broken wicker chairs, Coca-Cola bottles filled with mud, the shattered basin of a sink and shards of tile. Though they once fed an entire neighbourhood, now the Transito family is itself without food. Seeing their need, former customers gifted them a bag of rice and one 11-litre jug of water. Lucia said she expects the supplies to last only a day. But Lucia and her family are most worried about Beatriz, the matriarch of the family. She has diabetes, and at the time Al Jazeera visited their home, she had only one day’s worth of insulin left. To make matters worse, the insulin has likely lost its potency, as the medicine needs to be refrigerated. La Rinconada has been without electricity for days. “I don’t know what effect this will have on my body,” Beatriz said, as she prepared to take the insulin. Fear kept threatening to overwhelm her, as she grappled with the overall devastation. “I look around at the damage, and suddenly it grabs me and I realize that this is actually real. I have to hold in my emotions,” she said. “We’re really living in hell, aren’t we?” Though the Mexican government sent a fleet of emergency response teams to Acapulco, none are stationed near La Rinconada. Plus, insulin is one of the few medicines they do not carry, due to the lack of refrigeration. “People keep coming up and asking for it, but we have to turn them away,” said Nohemi Morales, a nurse working with the Mexican Health Department to assist with disaster relief in the city. For Beatriz to find insulin, she would have to leave Acapulco, but the family does not have enough money to pay for her evacuation on top of the food they will need for the coming days. Some families in the neighbourhood are living off what they can scavenge from destroyed supermarkets, according to the Transitos and their neighbours. Others are selling supplies at inflated prices. Three days after the hurricane hit, the Mexican government sent 8,000 food rations and 16,000 litres of water to Acapulco to address immediate needs. But many in the city said they have yet to receive any food supplies or aid. Hearing rumours that a military jeep would dispense rations to vulnerable people, seniors and young mothers, Lucia walked to the other side of her neighbourhood on October 28 to try to get some food. Her father Santiago could not make the trip: His feet were dotted with sores from stepping on broken glass, and his only remaining shoes were a pair of flip-flops. And her mother Beatriz could not go either. Her knees are weak from her diabetes. But after reaching the jeep, Lucia said she was turned away. She had waited in a long line in the heat, only to be told she needed to show her infant child as proof that she was among the qualifying residents. “How was I going to stand there for hours with my baby?” Lucia said. On November 3, over a week after the hurricane hit, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador announced that three million boxes of rations and over a million litres of water would be sent into Acapulco for 350,000 affected residents. “We’re going to help everyone, but we had to help those most in need first,” he said in a press conference. “We’re waiting for the government. They’re our only hope,” Beatriz said. As they held out for aid, the Transito family considered using their last pesos to buy ingredients and sell the food they cooked, as they had before the hurricane. “But all of our pots were carried away by the storm,” said Lucia. The pots still held green and white pozole from the day before.

Trees felled by gale-force winds caused several of the other deaths in Europe. In the Belgian city of Ghent, falling branches killed a five-year-old Ukrainian boy and a 64-year-old woman on Thursday.Falling trees had earlier killed a lorry driver in his vehicle in northern France's Aisne region.French officials also reported the death of a man who fell from his balcony in the port city of Le Havre.A man in the Dutch town of Venray, a woman in Madrid and a person in Germany were also killed.By 1700 GMT, 325,000 French households were still without power, mainly in Brittany and Normandy, according to Enedis power networks.

Videos online show what appears to be thick smoke blocking the display at Edgbaston Stadium on Saturday evening. The event was billed as the ""biggest fireworks spectacular in Birmingham"", but ticket holders flocked to social media to express their disappointment. The venue said adverse weather conditions had affected the event. Hundreds of people filled the stands in anticipation for the show. In a video that was shared with the BBC, the display appeared to start as expected with an array of colourful pyrotechnics exploding in the sky. However, thick plumes of smoke appear to emit from the site, blocking the view of the display. Several clips being shared on X have shown families standing up to leave in the middle of the show, while others appear to be in shock at what is taking place. Steph Darby, from Tipton, had spent nearly £100 to take her family to see the show. She said: ""When the fireworks started, within about 20 seconds it had evidently gone wrong. ""It went smoky really quickly, you couldn't see any of the fireworks, you couldn't even see where it was lighting from the floor. ""Everyone then noticed that the fireworks were hitting the floodlights but it didn't seem to be clearing the stadium at all, it was just smoke, you couldn't see a thing. ""It was disappointing, my two children had never seen fireworks before and they were really excited. People were walking out five minutes into it."" Bernie Phillips, from Kings Heath, was also in the crowd with her daughter hoping to see the display. She told the BBC: ""As the smoke came in, quite of a lot of the young children were getting scared so people just left. ""Some of the only fireworks that we could see were hitting the floodlights, which was a little bit scary. ""They carried on, which seems like a waste of thousands of pounds."" Scores of people have called for refunds. One X user said: ""We ended up going back inside, the smoke was choking us, I've never seen so much from a fireworks display before. ""Display should have been stopped in the first minute and delayed."" Another added: ""Shame - we had high hopes for this but seeing the fireworks bounce off the floodlights and then just a total disaster from there, very disappointed, we would like a refund."" A spokesperson for Edgbaston Stadium said: ""The Fireworks Spectacular is one of the most popular events in our calendar, with families returning year after year, so it's really disappointing the adverse weather conditions impacted last night's event. ""The same type and volume of fireworks were used on Friday night at the stadium and 4,000 visitors enjoyed an amazing display on a clear night. ""However, last night there was a lingering mist and the atmospheric conditions were such that smoke from the fireworks failed to dissipate. We understand that other displays in the region were also affected by the conditions."" The venue said it worked with an experienced pyrotechnics company to stage the event, adding it is thoroughly risk assessed in advance and during the display. An investigation into the issue has been launched and the stadium says it will communicate with all ticket holders as soon as possible. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

But Paulson's home, with a rounded shape that looks something like a ship, shrugged off Category 5 winds that might otherwise have collapsed it. “I wasn't nervous at all,” Paulson said, recalling the warning to evacuate. Her house lost only a few shingles, with photos taken after the storm showing it standing whole amid the wreckage of almost all the surrounding homes. Some developers are building homes like Paulson's with an eye toward making them more resilient to the extreme weather that's increasing with climate change, and friendlier to theenvironmentat the same time. Solar panels, for example, installed so snugly that high winds can't get underneath them, mean clean power that can survive a storm. Preserved wetlands and native vegetation that trap carbon in the ground and reduce flooding vulnerability, too. Recycled or advanced construction materials that reduce energy use as well as the need to make new material. A person's home is one of the biggest ways they can reduce their individual carbon footprint. Buildings release about 38% of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions each year. Some of the carbon pollution comes from powering things like lights and air conditioners and some of it from making the construction materials, like concrete and steel. Deltec, the company that built Paulson's home, says that only one of the nearly 1,400 homes it's built over the last three decades has suffered structural damage fromhurricane-force winds. But the company puts as much emphasis on building green, with higher-quality insulation that reduces the need for air conditioning, heat pumps for more efficient heating and cooling, energy-efficient appliances, and of course solar. “The real magic here is that we’re doing both,” chief executive Steve Linton. “I think a lot of times resilience is sort of the afterthought when you talk about sustainable construction, where it’s just kind of this is a feature on a list ... we believe that resilience is really a fundamental part of sustainability.” Other companies are developing entire neighborhoods that are both resistant to hurricanes and contribute less than average to climate change. Pearl Homes' Hunters Point community in Cortez, Florida, consists of 26 completed houses and 30 to be built by the end of 2024 that are all LEED-certified platinum, the highest level of one of the most-used green building rating systems. To reduce vulnerability to flooding, home sites are raised 16 feet (4.8 meters) above code. Roads are raised, too, and designed to direct accumulating rainfall away and onto ground where it may be absorbed. Steel roofs with seams allow solar panels to be attached so closely it's difficult for high winds to get under them, and the homes have batteries that kick in when power is knocked out. Pearl Homes CEO Marshall Gobuty said his team approached the University of Central Florida with a plan to build a community that doesn't contribute to climate change. “I wanted them to be not just sustainable, but resilient, I wanted them to be so unlike everything else that goes on in Florida,” Gobuty said. “I see homes that are newly built, half a mile away, that are underwater … we are in a crisis with how the weather is changing."" That resonates with Paulson, in Mexico Beach, who said she didn't want to “live day to day worried about tracking something in the Atlantic.” Besides greater peace of mind, she says, she's now enjoying energy costs of about $32 per month, far below the roughly $250 she said she paid in a previous home. “I don’t really feel that the population is taking into effect the environmental catastrophes, and adjusting for it,” she said. “We’re building the same old stuff that got blown away.” Babcock Ranch is another sustainable, hurricane-resilient community in South Florida. It calls itself the first solar-powered town in the U.S., generating 150 megawatts of electricity with 680,000 panels on 870 acres (350 hectares). The community was also one of the first in the country to have large batteries on site to store extra solar power to use at night or when the power is out. Syd Kitson founded Babcock Ranch in 2006. The homes are better able to withstand hurricane winds because the roofs are strapped to a system that connects down to the foundation. Power lines are buried underground so they can't blow over. The doors swing outward in some homes so when pressure builds up from the wind, they don't blast open, and vents help balance the pressure in garages. In 2022, Hurricane Ian churned over Babcock Ranch as a Category 4 storm. It left little to no damage, Kitson said. “We set out to prove that a new town and the environment can work hand-in-hand, and I think we’ve proven that,” said Kitson. “Unless you build in a very resilient way, you’re just going to constantly be repairing or demolishing the home.” The development sold some 73,000 acres (29,500 hectares) of its site to the state for wetland preservation, and on the land where it built, a team studied how water naturally flows through the local environment and incorporated it into its water management system. “That water is going to go where it wants to go, if you’re going to try and challenge Mother Nature, you’re going to lose every single time,” Kitson said. The wetlands, retention ponds, and native vegetation are better able to manage water during extreme rainfall, reducing the risk of flooded homes. In the Florida Keys, Natalia Padalino and her husband, Alan Klingler, plan to finish building a Deltec home by December. The couple was concerned about the future impacts global warming and hurricanes would have on the Florida Keys and researched homes that were both sustainable and designed to withstand these storms. “We believe we’re building something that’s going to be a phenomenal investment and reduce our risk of any major catastrophic situation,” Klingler said. “People have been really open and receptive. They tell us if a hurricane comes, they’re going to be staying in our place,” Padalino said. ___ The location of the Padalinos' home has been corrected to the Florida Keys, not the Panhandle.

In a 30-postthreadon X on October 19, Gemzer wrote about how herAirbnb guests flooded her property, leaving her ""homeless"" and more than $300,000 in debt — while she was pregnant. Want to hear an Airbnb horror story this Halloween season? Here's the story of how I ended up pregnant and homeless and in over $300,000 of debt after Airbnb guests flooded my home. It's a real cliffhanger.Would love your thoughts@airbnband@bchesky.pic.twitter.com/ASvguMlnet AndAirbnb wasn't doing much to help her clean up the mess. Its reimbursement offer didn't cover about 90% of her out-of-pocket costs, she wrote in the thread. Gemzer's thread went viral — garnering more than 20 million views — and a couple weeks later, the company came back to her with a bigger offer. Neither Gemzer nor Airbnb disclosed specific details about the offer — including the amount — but Gemzer believes her social-media blitz spurred the company into action. Airbnb didn't explicitly comment on how Gemzer's social-media activity impacted their final offer. ""After receiving additional documentation, we provided further support to our Host with some of the additional costs not covered by her insurance,"" a representative for the company told Insider via text message. On the morning of April 14, Gemzer — who lived in the lower unit of her duplex andrented out the upper unit on Airbnb— woke to what she described on X as ""waterfalls of water"" pouring from the ceiling and light fixtures. The guests who had been staying in the upper unit had checked out the day before — two days earlier than expected, she later told Insider by phone. Gemzer said she rushed upstairs, worried that one of her guests had drowned in the bathtub based on how much water was pouring down. Instead, she discovered that the toilet bowl in the upper unit was clogged and the valve connecting it to the water tank had been damaged. She wrote on X that water had been continuously flowing out of the toilet bowl for more than 15 hours by that point. Gemzer — who saidthe guests clogged the toilet — contacted Airbnb to figure out what the company would cover.Airbnb's Host Damage Protection policy, ""AirCover,"" reimburses hosts for up to $3 million in damages to their home or belongings,accordingto Airbnb's website. But the company told her it could only create a case under its Host Damage Protection program if the guests refused to pay, she wrote on X. Airbnb did open a case, but Gemzer told Insider it took weeks of correspondence with the company and the third-party adjuster it had hired to investigate the case before a plumber came to examine the toilet. Meanwhile, the bills kept piling up. But Airbnb has a slightly different account. ""We take Aircover requests seriously, including in this case, and we remained in continuous contact with the Host,"" its representative told Insider by text. In her posts on X last month, Gemzer saidher unreimbursed expenses were upward of $300,000, considering costs such as her water bill from the flooding, property taxes, mortgage payments, insurance-premium increases, damaged appliances, water-damage-restoration costs, packing and storing her belongings, and lost rental income. Drying the home alonecost about $130,000, and a contractor estimated that rebuilding the home will cost almost $250,000, though her homeowners' insurance is covering the bulk of those expenses, Gemzer later told Insider. Airbnb offered her $6,000 at one point before increasing the offer to about $31,000 in mid-October, she said on X, noting that the company asked her to sign away her rights to future payments with each offer. But she has accepted the company's most recent offer. While the new amount doesn't cover everything, it covers enough to ""make a difference,"" Gemzer told Insider via text. Since her post went viral, Gemzer said she's fielded criticism from ""nasty trolls on Twitter"" telling her she doesn't know how to run a business. She argued she never wanted to run one in the first place: ""I couldn't afford a single-family home. I bought a two-unit building because that's what I could afford, and I decided I have to become a landlord as a result of that."" While San Francisco'snotoriously pricey housing market has cooled in recent months,the median price for a home in the city was still around $1.3 million in September,accordingto Redfin's. And with the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom unit being about $3,000, California's housing departmentclassifies single-person households earning up to $104,400as ""low income."" Gemzer said she decided torent out the upper level of her duplex to Airbnb guestsfor short-term stays — instead of taking on long-term renters — so she'd have a space for her family after she gave birth. But officials at the San Francisco Planning Department said Gemzer's residence wasn't authorized for ""intermediate-length occupancy"" stays of between one month and a year,accordingto the San Francisco Chronicle. And Gemzer said her expensive — and emotionally exhausting — takeaway from the incident is that Airbnb doesn't do enough to ""educate"" hosts such as her. Not all Airbnb hosts are ""mini corporations"" running several Airbnb locations, she said. Gemzer would now advise other Airbnb hosts to get homeowners' insurance, umbrella insurance, and short-term-rental insurance. Since the incident, Gemzer said she'slived in four different Airbnbsin an ""ironic"" turn of events and recently signed a lease for another home in the area while she waits for construction to finish on her duplex.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'poland']",us,True,True

Andy Beshear'sreelection bid on Tuesdayby tying him to the widely unpopular President Joe Biden. But in this ruby red state that Biden lost by more than 25 points three years ago, Beshear appears to be offering Democrats hope of local success amid party-wide handwringing: voters supporting both Beshear and his Republican challenger, Attorney General Daniel Cameron, told ABC News that the governor's brand was strong enough to blunt any ties to the White House. ""Andy Beshear is a more liberal Democrat than the average Kentucky Democrat. Kentucky Democrats are pretty conservative. Now, is he the clone of Joe Biden? No,"" said Steve Megerle, an attorney and lifelong Republican in Fort Thomas, who said he is debating between voting for Beshear and leaving the governor's line blank on Tuesday. ""I probably don't see Beshear as bad as Biden,"" Carol Taylor told ABC News at a Cameron campaign event in Richmond. ""I don't think I can say anything good about [Biden]."" To be sure, Beshear's reelection is no sure thing. A former state attorney general and son of a former governor, he narrowly won his first term in 2019 against an unpopular incumbent Republican and, given how the state usually votes, he'll have to win over a large swath of conservatives to stay in office, withrecent polling previewinga neck-and-neck race. But interviews with more than 20 operatives and voters of both parties revealed a lack of the kind of vitriol about Beshear that is usually evident when a governor is about to be unseated. The trend could prove notable for other down-ballot Democrats in 2024 as they try to persuade voters to view them separately from Biden while sharing a ticket with him. The governor's race could also show some signs of how Democrats will fare next year both in House seats the party holds where Donald Trump also won and in Senate races in Montana, Ohio and West Virginia, which like Kentucky often vote for Republicans. Beshear has some big advantages, strategists and experts said: He holds the edge in fundraising, helping him lap Cameron in advertising, and he has been credited for his handling of floods and tornadoes that struck Kentucky during his term, including repeated travel to the disaster sites and other locations to tout economic development projects. And while many Republicans continue to criticize closures during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, voters who spoke with ABC News also spontaneously cited Beshear's daily press conferences to update Kentuckians. ""Oh gosh, what's not to love? He really was a super calming effect during the pandemic,"" said Laura Taylor, a stay-at-home mom in Fort Thomas. Adele Gormley, another Beshear backer, put it even more bluntly: ""He kept us alive during COVID."" That's not how the GOP sees it. ""Joe Biden was endorsed by Andy Beshear, and I can't think of a bigger slap in the face to Kentuckians,"" Cameron, his rival, said in an interview after a stop in Georgetown. The attacks have caught on with some. ""I think his values are the total opposite, and he doesn't align with the values of Kentuckians. I want to see him removed. He's just a puppet for Joe Biden,"" said Karson Carrier, a 22-year-old Eastern Kentucky University student. However, most voters who spoke with ABC News said they view Beshear as not just another Democrat, with Megerle dubbing him ""Andy dad jeans."" Beshear's disaster and pandemic response ""put him in a light of someone that's the healer in chief, with great compassion, and has kind of set him apart from a typical partisan politician,"" said T.J. Litafik, a Kentucky GOP strategist. The governor, who said he hasn't spoken with Biden since last year's flooding, swatted away Cameron's attacks. ""He knows that if it's me versus him, he can't win. He's trying to nationalize this race and trick people,"" Beshear told ABC News at a stop in Newport. So far, among other issues, he and Cameron have sparred over abortion access and school choice vouchers. Some Republicans in the state complained that Beshear's bipartisan popularity is undeserved, particularly over his promotion of tax cuts -- which were pushed by the state Legislature's GOP supermajority -- and updates to the Brent Spence Bridge connecting Kentucky and Cincinnati, which some pointed out was arguably really accomplished by the White House and Congress authorizing new infrastructure money. ""It's disturbing to me to see him take credit for that,"" Republican state Rep. Kim Moser said of the tax cuts. ""Unfortunately, not everyone studies the policy and the legislation that passes as much as, certainly, I do and my colleagues, because we work there."" Whatever the outcome on Tuesday, strategists in both parties suggested Kentucky's election could be something of a tea leaf for 2024. The state's previous six gubernatorial races foreshadowed the results of the following year's presidential election results, with the winning party in Kentucky matching the winning party in the White House. ""I think there are going to be things to learn here no matter whether it's Cameron or Beshear,"" said GOP strategist Scott Jennings, who has worked with Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell. Other experts didn't go that far, noting that it's an off-year race for state rather than a federal office. And, they said, Beshear has the flexibility to make typical Democratic arguments on issues like abortion and transgender rights because he knows his views on such hot-button issues aren't likely to be enacted and affect voters given that Republicans run the Legislature. ""Andy Beshear's a terrible example for national Democrats of what to do, because he's not by any means taking positions that make him a moderate,"" said Jake Cox, a Kentucky GOP strategist who worked for Ryan Quarles' gubernatorial primary campaign. Still, Democrats are likely to take notes from Beshear's tactics, including over his ability to use his massive fundraising advantage to try to win over detractors. When meeting ABC News at a local bar, Megerle brought two pieces of pro-Cameron mail advertisements that he said he's received. He then handed over eight mailers from Beshear's campaign -- saying those were just the ones he had kept. While ""it takes a lot for me to vote for a Democrat,"" he said, he wasn't ruling it out. ""I think I'll figure it out when I walk into the booth on Election Day.""","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'guyana']",us,True,True

With the civil war between rival militaries now in its 200th day, children ""continue to pay the highest price for a crisis not of their making - increasingly with their own lives"", said the agency in a statement. There are more children now displaced there than anywhere in the world, with three million fleeing the fighting between Government and rival militia forces, mostly within Sudan. Hundreds of thousands are sheltering in make-shift camps in neighbouring countries. ""Some 14 million children in Sudan are in urgent need of life-saving humanitarian assistance"", the agency said. ""Many of them are living in a state of perpetual fear - fear of being killed, injured, recruited or used by armed actors."" Reports of conflict-related sexual violence, including rape, are rampant, with fighting only intensifying in recent weeks in places like Khartoum, Darfur, and Kordofans. So far, UNICEF has received allegations of over 3,100 severe violations, including the killing and maiming of children. Future in the balance ""Meanwhile, none of Sudan's children have been able to return to school, with the future of an entire generation now hanging in the balance. A staggering 19 million children in Sudan are unable to return to classrooms. UNICEF and partners are providing life-saving assistance to millions of children inside Sudan and in neighboring countries, including water, health, nutrition, safe spaces and learning. But needs are outpacing resources. ""We need safe and unhindered humanitarian access to deliver life-saving supplies and services to reach every child in need."" South Sudan malnutrition alert: WFP In neighbouring South Sudan, children in flood-affected areas are at risk of extreme malnutrition in the first half of 2024, with food running low and water-borne diseases spreading fast amid crowded living conditions. That's the message from the UN World Food Programme (WFP), which said on Monday that 1.6 million children under five are expected to suffer from malnutrition in 2024. Rubkona, a county where floodwaters have permanently submerged entire communities or trapped them on small islands since 2021, will be particularly affected. ""This is the reality of living on the frontline of the climate crisis,"" warned Mary-Ellen McGroarty, WFP Representative to South Sudan. She stressed that the spread of waterborne diseases ""unravels any work humanitarian agencies do in preventing and treating malnutrition and it is young children who are suffering the impact most severely"". Rubkona county is predicted to be on the brink of famine for the first time ever. WFP said that this is a result of the floods along with ""severe economic shocks"" which have sent the prices of staple foods soaring by more than 120 per cent since last April. The UN agency also highlighted an expected rise in the number of people facing catastrophic hunger across the country to 79,000 by April, ""largely due to South Sudanese returnees fleeing fighting in Sudan"". According to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) nearly 300,000 returnees have crossed the border from Sudan since the conflict there erupted almost seven months ago. Ukraine: UNESCO condemns attack on Odesa World Heritage site In Ukraine, a cultural site under international protection has been damaged in a Russian attack once again, prompting condemnation from the UN educational, social and cultural agency UNESCO on Monday. The Museum of Fine Arts within Odesa's historic centre, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was damaged by a Russian airstrike on Sunday night, the agency said. The historic centre has been hit several times previously, notably over the summer. UNESCO reiterated that cultural sites must be protected in accordance with international law. Prior to the latest attack, as of 2 November, UNESCO had verified damage to 327 cultural sites since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, including 124 religious sites and 28 museums. In the Odesa region alone, 49 sites have been damaged. Ukraine is home to eight UNESCO World Heritage sites. The UN agency has been supporting repairs to buildings within Odesa's historic centre, including the fine arts museum, and has provided equipment for the digitization of some 1,000 works of art and of documents in the Odesa State Archives.","['sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'unitedstates', 'southsudan', 'southsudan', 'southsudan', 'southsudan', 'not found', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'russia']",us,True,False

The destruction of bridges and roads has reportedly made it difficult to reach the affected areas, thus complicating rescue efforts. The Le Monde newspaper has attributed the above-average rainfall in East Africa between October and December to the El Nino weather phenomenon, citing data from the UN Humanitarian Coordination Office (OCHA). Because of El Nino, the Pacific jet stream moves further south and east, which often brings a rise in temperatures in some regions and heavy rains in others, including East Africa. “Floods due to heavy rains have affected at least 405,652 people, with fourteen deaths”since the start of monsoon season in Somali Region, which runs from October to December, the OCHA reported on Saturday.“At least 47,100 people have relocated to higher grounds to avoid the risk of flooding,”it added. The areas surrounding the banks of the Juba River have also experienced flooding in Somalia’s Jubbaland state due to the heavy rains that started last month. Earlier this year, the Somalian town of Beledweyne was submerged due to flooding of the Shabelle River, forcing around 250,000 people to leave their homes. Meanwhile, three weeks ago Ghana was also affected by flooding. Over 4,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes when the Akosombo Dam broke during the rainy season. The recent bouts of severe weather have affected nearly two million people and washed away thousands of livestock animals in Burundi, Djibouti,Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Tanzania, South Sudan and Uganda. “Climate change is making floods more frequent and severe … There is an urgent need to invest in climate adaptation measures to protect communities from the devastating impacts of floods and other adverse weather conditions,”the Kenya Red Cross Society has stated.","['sweden', 'sweden', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'ghana', 'burundi', 'djibouti', 'kenya', 'ethiopia', 'tanzania', 'southsudan', 'uganda']",ru,False,False

Emergency rescuers were working to reach an estimated 2,400 people still trapped by flood waters in the Luuq district of southern Somalia's Jubaland state. The U.N. had called for the evacuation of people living along the entire stretch of the Juba River, warning of a high risk of flooding there and along the Shabelle River. In Kenya, the Red Cross said 15 people had died as a result of flooding. It said floods also destroyed 97 hectares of agricultural farmland and killed 1,067 animals. Kenyan weather forecasters have been warning the country since September to expect heavy precipitation between October and December, the country's rainy season. Weather experts were contradicted by Kenyan President William Ruto, who predicted ""there would be no devastating El Nino flooding."" El Nino, a naturally occurring weather phenomenon, causes surface waters of the central and eastern Pacific to warm, affecting weather patterns around the world. The heavy rains come one year after the horn of Africa suffered its worst drought in around 40 years, which along with rising prices in food due to war in Ukraine, caused 43,000 people to die, according to the U.N., and put Somalia on the brink of famine. The severe weather also affected the Somali region of Ethiopia, where crops failed to grow and thousands were displaced from their homes.

Heavy rain and flooding last month saw 6,000 tonnes of debris collapse onto the A816, cutting off access to large parts of the Craignish peninsula. Travellers to the area now face a 90-minute road diversion - and many weeks before other routes are re-established. Businesses have banded together as they face weeks of unprecedented disruption, urging people to shop locally. Many were still feeling the after-effects of the Covid pandemic combined with the current cost-of-living crisis - and, following the recent extreme weather conditions, some are now fighting for survival. A group, led by the Craignish Community Company charity, is aiming to help local business get through the ""unprecedented disruption"". Chairperson Vicki Burnett told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme there was a perception Craignish was ""lost to the rest of the country"". She added: ""We are very much not. We are very much open for business. ""We have a lot of really amazing businesses on the peninsula. Many of these businesses won't survive six weeks with no income."" Although access to the area is still available from the north, via the A816, it could be weeks before specialist engineers make the main route safe. Ms Burnett said the perception that the region was still completely inaccessible had resulted in lower footfall than usual. And she admitted some businesses were struggling to get staff to work. One local woodsman had been left short-staffed because his worker lives on the other side of the landslip, she said - while a nearby yacht club has had to use a boat to bring their staff to work. Ms Burnett also said local children have been separated from friends who live south of the landslide. She said the Craignish Community Company was taking a two-pronged approach to deal with the problems caused by the landslip. ""We want to keep this issue in the spotlight to encourage the local authority and their contractors to get this work done as quickly as possible, and to make sure any additional support we're entitled to comes here,"" she added. ""But we're also pleading with the wider Argyll and West of Scotland community - 'don't forget about us'."" The annual Craignish Christmas market is due to go ahead on the 18 November weekend and information about local businesses can be found online. Argyll and Bute Council said it has made good progress clearing debris from the A186. On the council's website, it said it is looking to open up an emergency diversion route which it expects to have in place by ""mid-December, before the landslip-affected part of the A816 is open"".","['canada', 'canada', 'canada', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom']",gb,True,True

Obasanjo said, “Climate change is a reality, though some still believe it is a myth or not real, but we have seen it in flood, drought, the extreme weather conditions, among others. “The scientists have helped us to understand that man has abused the balance of all that God created, the forest, the hills, valleys, animals, among others, to the extent that there is now imbalance. And it is we that caused the imbalance that will also be victims of these consequences, like the sea level rising, victims of floods, drought, extreme weather conditions and, of course, change in climate, food insecurity, among others.” According to Obasanjo, the way to fight climate change is to embrace a green economy, which encompasses all efforts to generate less carbon and absorb more of it through green vegetation.",[],ng,False,False

Third Quarter 2023 Highlights Management Commentary Lasse Petterson, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, ""The third quarter, as expected, was a challenging quarter due to vessel drydocks and idle equipment due to market delays from 2022 and the first half of 2023. Despite the challenges, we continued to bid on projects and build a solid backlog for the fourth quarter and for 2024. Great Lakes ended the quarter with $1.03 billion of dredging backlog, which does not include approximately $50.0 million of performance obligations related to offshore wind contracts and $225.0 million in low bids and options pending award. At the end of the third quarter, 71.2% of Great Lakes' backlog consists of capital projects. In the third quarter, we added $519.7 million in capital projects, which includes two Liquified Natural Gas (""LNG"") projects, the Brownsville Ship Channel project for Next Decade Corporation’s Rio Grande LNG project, and the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project for Marine Dredging and Disposal. The Rio Grande Brownsville LNG project is the largest project undertaken in Great Lakes' history. Our proven performance and safety culture allows us to support the growth of LNG export in the U.S., which is a necessity in balancing energy affordability and overall sustainability. In addition, we added $235.6 million in maintenance and coastal protection projects to our dredging backlog in the third quarter. As we have navigated the challenges from 2022 and have seen the ramp up in bidding in 2023, we have remained focused on cost reductions and fleet adjustments, including temporary cold stacking of vessels, and we have adjusted our general and administrative, overhead cost structures and dredging fleet to reflect the changed market conditions coming into 2023. As we have stated previously, cold stacked vessels can easily be reactivated as the market continues to improve. One of our recent project wins will allow us to reactivate a previously cold stacked vessel in the near future. In addition, our newest hopper dredge, theGalveston Islandis expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2023 and her sistership, theAmelia Island, is expected to be delivered in 2025. Also, we took delivery of our two multi cats, theCape Hatterasand theCape Canaveral, which support our strong safety culture and provide Great Lakes the ability to dredge with enhanced operating efficiencies needed to maintain our shorelines and waterways. We believe the improved dredging bid market combined with our fleet adjustments and our cost reduction and production initiatives, will position us well to achieve improved results into 2024 and beyond. We are executing on our strategy to enter the U.S. offshore wind market. On July 20, 2023, we were honored to have President Biden attend the steel cutting ceremony for Great Lakes’ offshore wind rock installation vessel, theAcadia,which marks another step forward as construction begins with expected delivery in 2025. In addition, Great Lakes signed the first ever subcontract for procurement of rock with Carver Sand & Gravel LLC, a U.S. quarry in the state of New York. Both milestones solidify our entry into the offshore wind market and will support Great Lakes' awarded rock installation contracts for the Empire Wind I and II projects with estimated installation windows in 2025 and 2026. We continue to monitor developments on related power purchase agreements (""PPA's"") after the refusal by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (""NYSERDA"") to renegotiate the agreements for Equinor and BP's Empire Wind I and II projects and Orsted's Sunrise Wind project. We expect updates from Equinor in the fourth quarter on potential impacts to their development plans for the Empire Wind projects. The U.S. offshore wind market has seen other projects delayed or cancelled due to higher interest rates and inflation. However, on October 24, 2023, the third round of PPA's for the state of New York saw 4 gigawatts (""GW"") of PPA's awarded to three operators and we continue to bid on projects with scheduled offshore installation windows in 2026 and onward."" Operational Update Market Update We continue to see strong support from the Biden Administration and Congress for the dredging industry. In December 2022, the Omnibus Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2023 was signed into law which included another record budget of $8.66 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the ""Corps"") civil works program of which $2.32 billion is provided for the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (“HMTF”) to maintain and modernize our nation’s waterways. In addition, the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2023 was approved which included $1.48 billion for the Corps to make necessary repairs to infrastructure impacted by hurricanes and other natural disasters, and to initiate beach renourishment projects that will increase coastal resiliency. Some related projects for beach renourishment have come to bid, and we expect to see additional beach renourishment work in the later part of this year. This increased budget and additional funding has resulted in a strong bid market for 2023, which we expect to continue for the remainder of the year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the bid market, not including LNG or offshore wind projects, was $1.8 billion, of which Great Lakes won 31.0%. The increase in the bid market was driven by a strong market for capital projects, which has already seen seven bids for port improvement projects including Freeport, San Juan, and Norfolk. The total capital bid market for port improvement projects through the third quarter totaled $459.2 million, of which 39% of the market year to date was won by Great Lakes. We expect the budgeted appropriations to support the funding of several previously delayed capital port improvement projects that are still expected to bid before the end of 2023, including Sabine, Houston, and Mobile. In March 2023, President Biden released the President’s Fiscal Year 2024 executive budget. The proposed amount for the Corps targets $7.4 billion, which is a record amount for a President's budget. In June 2023, the House proposed an increased 2024 budget of $9.6 billion for the Corps, which is $910 million above fiscal year 2023 and includes $2.8 billion for the HMTF and $1.5 billion for flood and storm damage reduction. In July 2023, the Senate Committee on Appropriations passed the budget which targets $8.9 billion for the Corps. This will move to the Senate floor for further deliberation and consideration. This proposed budget is expected to provide for a strong 2024 bid market. Currently, the government is operating under a continuing resolution until the budget is approved. At the end of 2022, the Water Resources Development Act of 2022, or WRDA 2022, was approved by Congress and signed into law by the President. WRDA 2022 is on a two-year renewal cycle and includes legislation that authorizes the financing of Corps’ projects for flood and hurricane protection, dredging, ecosystem restoration and other construction projects. Among many other things, WRDA 2022 featured authorization for New York and New Jersey shipping channels to be deepened to 55 feet, estimated at $6 billion, as well as the Coastal Texas Protection and Restoration Program, estimated at $34.4 billion. The Coastal Texas program includes dune and marsh restoration to safeguard the Texas Gulf Coast from hurricane surges. In addition, this legislation includes policy changes that will allow future port, waterways, and coastal projects to be more readily approved and funded. Offshore wind has been recognized around the world as a reliable source of renewable energy. Globally installed offshore wind capacity is targeted to reach about 260 GW by 2030, up from 40 GW in 2020. In 2021, the Biden Administration announced the ambitious goal of 30 GW of U.S. offshore wind by 2030 and provided $3.0 billion in federal loan guarantees for offshore wind projects. The administration’s support for offshore wind culminated in the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate mitigation act ever passed by Congress. As stated previously, Great Lakes was awarded the rock installation contracts for Equinor and BP's Empire Wind I and II projects with estimated installation windows in 2025 and 2026. The developer requested adjustments to the PPA's for these two projects which New York rejected in October and we are awaiting updates in the fourth quarter for potential impacts on the project schedules. New York continues to take steps forward in meeting their renewable energy goals with the announcement on October 24, 2023, of three new project awards with the capacity of approximately 4 GW of offshore wind energy and a new accelerated fourth bid round for additional PPA's was announced for early 2024. Vineyard Wind, the first commercial scale offshore wind farm on the East Coast recently completed installation of the first offshore wind turbine, while South Fork Wind, currently under construction, will be the first offshore wind farm to supply power to the State of New York. Although the market is facing some short-term challenges, the long-term outlook for offshore wind in the U.S. is optimistic, based on strong fundamentals and commitment by the U.S. to meet its energy independence and de-carbonization targets. Great Lakes has established a unique business position in the U.S. offshore wind market and we continue to tender bids on multiple offshore wind projects for theAcadia, our subsea rock installation vessel.

Use of Non-GAAP measures Adjusted EBITDA, as provided herein, represents net income (loss) from continued operations, adjusted for net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, debt extinguishment, accelerated maintenance expense for new international deployments, goodwill or asset impairments and gains on bargain purchase acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as an additional measure by which to evaluate the Company's operating trends. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a measure frequently used to evaluate performance of companies with substantial leverage and that the Company's primary stakeholders (i.e., its stockholders, bondholders and banks) use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the Company's period to period performance. Additionally, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides a transparent measure of the Company’s recurring operating performance and allows management and investors to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance. For this reason, the Company uses a measure based upon Adjusted EBITDA to assess performance for purposes of determining compensation under the Company's incentive plan. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with GAAP including: (a) operating income as an indicator of operating performance; or (b) cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. As such, the Company's use of Adjusted EBITDA, instead of a GAAP measure, has limitations as an analytical tool, including the inability to determine profitability or liquidity due to the exclusion of accelerated maintenance expense for new international deployments, goodwill or asset impairments, gains on bargain purchase acquisitions, net interest and income tax expense and the associated significant cash requirements and the exclusion of depreciation and amortization, which represent significant and unavoidable operating costs given the level of indebtedness and capital expenditures needed to maintain the Company's business. For these reasons, the Company uses operating income (loss) to measure the Company's operating performance and uses Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplement. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to net income (loss) from continuing operations in the table of financial results. For further explanation, please refer to the Company's SEC filings.

Vientiane, Laos– Keo remembers the day he consumed so much yaba that he “lost his mind.” The 37-year-old from Laos took more of the drug – a potent combination of methamphetamine and caffeine – than he had ever done before. “I took 10 pills and I was totally lost. I didn’t recognise my family, I didn’t even recognise my children,” the father of two told Al Jazeera at the Transformation Center, a drug rehab facility 25km (16 miles) outside the Lao capital Vientiane, where he is receiving treatment. “I couldn’t sleep at all. I didn’t drink, I didn’t eat. I felt powerful.” Drug-free for just four days, Keo cut a frail and subdued figure as he explained that yaba, which means “crazy medicine” in Thai, helps him “escape all the thoughts”. He said it was his family who made him seek help. A yaba user for 17 years, he said the Southeast Asian country’s drug landscape has transformed in that time. “When I started, drugs were not this common,” he said. “Now there’s more and more; it’s everywhere now, even in Vientiane.” The growing availability of methamphetamine in Laos, as witnessed by drug users like Keo, is part of a nationwide surge in supply that has today reached “unprecedented” levels, United Nations experts told Al Jazeera. Part of the problem is neighbouring Myanmar, where the 2021 coup has created a violent conflict and a vacuum in law and order that has allowed drug syndicates to thrive. In Laos, the poorly-resourced police are facing a deluge of narcotics as the country has become a vital trafficking corridor in Asia’s drug trade. The surge has pushed prices down to record lows, with front-line workers saying pills are now being sold for as little as $0.24 cents each –cheaper than most basic necessities like food and water and making the drug affordable to all in one of Asia’s poorest countries. Bounme, the assistant director at the Transformation Center, one of only two privately-run rehabilitation centres in the country, told Al Jazeera that while “everything got more expensive” in Laos during COVID-19, “drugs got cheaper, a lot cheaper.” He preferred to be identified only by one name. “Drug users tell me one piece of yaba is 5,000 to 7,000 kip [$0.24 to $0.34] now,” said Bounme, who interviews new patients entering the clinic. “If you buy a pack of 200, you can get it as cheap as 2,500 [$0.12] per pill.” The Golden Triangle, the remote area in which the borders of Thailand, Myanmar and Laos meet, has long been one of the world’s major drug-producing hotspots. Historically, it wasnotorious for opium, but recent years have seen drug syndicates turn to producing methamphetamine pills and crystal meth – a distilled, more potent and expensive variety of the drug. Groups in Myanmar are at the heart of this trade, most prominently Shan state – a war-torn region in the country’s east sharing a long, porous border with Laos. For decades, the drug trade has provided vital funds for ethnic armed groups and military-aligned militias in the troubled state, with narcotics flowing across the border into China, Laos, and Thailand and onto the international market. The coup in Myanmar has only accelerated the industry’s output. The generals’ removal of the democratically-elected National League for Democracy government drove widespread protests and the military’s brutal response pushed the pro-democracy movement into a nationwide armed resistance. With growing lawlessness andintensified fightingacross the country, the anti-narcotics efforts of certain ethnic armed groups and the Myanmar authorities have been hampered. More militias under the command of the military have also reportedly turned to drugs to fund food and salaries for their soldiers. In Shan state, these post-coup conditions have created a “perfect storm” fordrug production, according to Jeremy Douglas, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s (UNODC) regional representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific. “You have the breakdown of security in Shan state, an acceleration [of drug production] post-coup, and a massive and very porous border along the Mekong river between Shan and Laos,” he told Al Jazeera. “It’s a recipe for disaster.” The chaos has resulted in record flows of narcotics over the border into Laos, with Douglas saying that the country, as the “path of least resistance,” has become a “major gateway” for drugs into the region. “When you look at drug supply, it’s at unprecedented levels, there’s no doubt about that. Laos has never seen the volumes that they see now,” he said. “Traffickers are using Laos to move massive quantities of drugs from Shan out to regional and international markets, and larger volumes of chemicals back the other way.” Lao authorities have registered several high-profile wins in their battle against the traffickers. Notably, in October 2021, they conducted Asia’slargest-ever drug bust, intercepting a beer truck in Bokeo province carrying 55 million methamphetamine tablets and 1.5 tonnes of crystal meth. AJune reportby UNODC also showed a second successive record-breaking year for seizures of methamphetamine tablets in Laos in 2022, with 144 million pills intercepted. In 2019 and 2020, this figure stood at just 17.7 million and 18.6 million respectively. But while large seizures make for good headlines, the criminal networks facilitating the shipments have been left untouched, according to an international observer with close knowledge of Laos. The source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of his work, told Al Jazeera that “philosophical differences” with Western anti-narcotics approaches, combined with a “lack of capacity”, means “there doesn’t seem to be any real effort to identify drug networks”. “The drug seizure is the goal [for Lao police] and the seizures seem to be ad hoc in nature,” he said. “More troubling, authorities often don’t make an arrest at all; very often they don’t even arrest the driver of the vehicle.” The Lao government could not be reached for comment. The source said that, while collusion between officials and criminal networks does occur, he generally believes there is a “sincere” effort by Lao authorities to crack down on drug trafficking. But he says he is concerned the current approach is misguided because the amount of drugs being seized is probably only a tiny fraction of the total entering the country. “We see a lot of seizures, but that doesn’t actually give a real sense of the volume that’s not being detected,” the source said. “There’s a clear oversupply, so whatever efforts are being made to limit the intake is not having an impact. The falling price is a great indicator of that.” That price has fallen so far that Douglas said Laos now offers “close to the cheapest” meth in the world – alongside Myanmar and parts of northern Thailand. This is part of a “total price collapse” around the drug as the region has been flooded with pills. “Meth tablets are probably a third or maybe a quarter of what they were five or six years ago,” he said. “Laos may not be a wealthy country but you don’t need much money to use yaba these days. It’s cheaper than beer and fried rice.” Karen Peters, a regional drug and health programme officer at UNODC who has supported community-based drug rehabilitation projects in Laos for eight years, told Al Jazeera that while methamphetamine is now “ridiculously cheap”, the extent to which this has translated to wider drug use in the general population remains unclear in the absence of reliable statistics. The Lao National Commission for Drug Control and Supervision estimates there were about 90,000 drug users as of 2023, or about 1 percent of the population, based on government surveys. Peters said these figures should be taken “with a pinch of salt” given the country’s highly punitive approach to drug use. She added that it was “impossible to get accurate data” in the absence of more nuanced collection methods like wastewater testing and anonymous online surveys. “[In Laos], drug use can land you in a compulsory treatment centre or prison,” she said. “If I have a government official knocking on my door asking about the number of people that use drugs in my house, why would I admit it?” But while the link between falling prices and increased availability with the growth in drug users across Laos is yet to be established, what is clear to Bounme at the Transformation Center is that these factors have tightened the drug’s grip on those already addicted. “People these days seem to use more,” he said. “Some people take two or three, maybe five pills a day.” Bounme oversees a holistic treatment programme at the centre – including daily tasks like cooking, cleaning and tending to a small farm with ducks, chickens and geese – intended to instil a sense of responsibility and structure in the men. A separate centre provides help to women and children who use drugs. For newly-arrived Keo, he hopes his time at the Transformation Center will be a turning point but he is aware of the grip yaba has had on him for almost all of his adult life. “I’ve tried several times to quit but I wake up and start using again,” Keo said. “But someone from my village came here and now he’s free. I want to be like that.” Additional reporting by Lamxay Duangchan Follow Al Jazeera English:","['laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'india', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'thailand', 'thailand', 'thailand', 'china', 'china']",us,False,False

The reversal occurred days after officials in Calumet City mailed several citations to Hank Sanders, a Daily Southtown reporter whose job includes covering the suburb, the Chicago Tribune reported Monday. The Southtown is owned by the Tribune’s parent company, The tickets from the city of 35,000, located 24 miles (39 kilometers) south of Chicago, had alleged “interference/hampering of city employees” by Sanders. The Southtown published a story online Oct. 19 and in print Oct. 20 in which Sanders reported that consultants had informed Calumet City officials that their stormwater facilities were in poor condition before September’s historic rains caused flooding. A day after the story was published online, Sanders continued to report on the issue, drawing complaints from city officials, including Mayor Thaddeus Jones, that he was calling employees to seek comment. Calumet City attorney Patrick K. Walsh sent a Tribune lawyer a letter Monday dismissing the citations. Tribune Executive Editor Mitch Pugh said the newspaper is “glad that cooler heads prevailed and Calumet City officials understood the error of their ways and dismissed these charges.” “We’re glad to see Hank can get back to doing his job serving the readers of the Daily Southtown, and we’ll continue to be vigilant watching how city officials treat him in his capacity of reporter,” Pugh said. “We’ll continue to support our journalists’ right to do their jobs, whether in Calumet City or elsewhere.” In his letter, Walsh said city employees “have a right to refuse to speak with” Sanders. But, Walsh added: “I understand it would be Mr. Sanders’ position and your argument that he was not harassing anyone.” The letter from Walsh encourages Sanders to direct his inquiries to the suburb’s spokesperson and concludes: “Mr. Sanders is a nice young reporter and I wish him well with his career.” On Monday, Sanders was back at work reporting. The city citations were the latest of several recent First Amendment dust-ups involving city officials and news outlets around the country, following last week's arrest of a small-town Alabama newspaper publisher and reporter after reporting on a grand jury investigation of a school district, and the August police raid of a newspaper and its publisher's home in Kansas tied to an apparent dispute a restaurant owner had with the paper.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",us,True,True

But they can be hard to anticipate due to their rarity and the lack of data at many sites, which means flood defenses and emergency response plans are often insufficient, exacerbating the impacts on communities.A team of European scientists, including experts at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), analyzed river discharges—the volume of water flowing through a channel per second—from 8,000 gauging stations across Europe from 1810–2021 to identify historic megafloods.They found 95.5% of megafloods could have been anticipated based on previous events at locations elsewhere in the continent with similar climate and variability in terms of how much water that rivers discharge in response to factors such as rainfall and temperature.UKCEH Principal Hydrologist Jamie Hannaford was a co-author of the study,publishedinNature Geoscience. He explains, ""Our findings demonstrate that while the most extreme floods shocklocal communities, they are not usually surprising if we take a continental-scale viewpoint.""""In the UK we already look beyond local catchments and consider events from other locations when assessing flood risk, but this is still limited to within our borders.

However, the new study showed that the discharge rate was similar to floods in northern Austria in 2002.Examples in the UK include the 2009 floods in the Derwent catchment in Cumbria, where the discharge was 58% greater than the second largest event on record there, but not as extreme as flooding in similar catchments in Norway.Mr. Hannaford and fellow UKCEH hydrologist Steve Turner were among the team of 56 researchers representing institutes in 29 countries, led by the Vienna University of Technology.Astudy in 2019by the same research team found thatfloodevents are becoming increasingly severe in north-western Europe, with northern England and southern Scotland among the areas most affected, but decreasing in severity in southern and Eastern Europe.","['germany', 'germany', 'germany', 'germany', 'uk', 'uk', 'netherlands', 'belgium', 'luxembourg', 'us', 'austria', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'norway']",gb,True,False
177172,cnn,CNN,Anna Bahney,Climate change is impacting the home insurance industry and damaging the housing market,"When Michael Monaghan, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker Sellers Realty in northern California, got an offer for a home in Bayside at the seller’s $650,000 list price in September, he told the buyer’s agent that the buyer needed to start looking for in…",https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/07/homes/homeowners-insurance-climate-real-estate/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1397095448.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2023-11-07 15:55:11,"When Michael Monaghan, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker Sellers Realty in northern California, got an offer for a home in Bayside at the sellers $650,000 list price in September, he told the … [+7400 chars]",Real estate,"When Michael Monaghan, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker Sellers Realty in northern California, got an offer for a home in Bayside at the seller’s $650,000 list price in September, he told the buyer’s agent that the buyer needed to start looking for insurance immediately. “I said, ‘Start working on this on day one,’” Monaghan said. “Getting insurance is the most important thing right now when you’re in escrow for the deal to close.” In the past, acquiring homeowners’ insurance didn’t present buyers much difficulty, but as climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather, insurers — especially those in areas most impacted byfloodsand fires —are raising their premiums, or pulling out altogether,impacting the affordability and availability of home and fire insurance. For example, in May, State Farm, the largest home insurer in the state, announced it wouldpause issuing policiesin California, citing wildfire risks. That came after Allstate stopped issuing policies in the state. Farmers Insurance deemed it too risky to continue insuring homes in Florida andpulled out of the marketthere entirely. “With many carriers pulling out, that leaves other companies underwriting these really expensive policies,” said Monaghan. “Policies that cost $10,000 for a year? That is impossible for some buyers who have to pay that all at once [along] with their closing costs.” In Maui and across America, climate change and extreme weather are hurting housing affordability To help a deal close, Monaghan said some motivated sellers have given two years’ worth of insurance costs to the buyer. But even if a buyer can pay their insurance costs up front (or even has them paid by the seller), buyers still have backed out of deals, worried thattheir insurance premiums will go up in the years to come. He said buyers wonder, “Will [they] be able to afford it next year? Will their policy be canceled? Then, if they can’t get another insurer, their loan gets called. It is a never-ending death spiral.” As the closing day came for his clients’ home in Bayside, it became clear the buyers had not secured insurance. Monaghanbegan calling around to help. The most affordable option he could find was $6,348 for the year. The average cost for homeowners’ insurance in the United States is about $1,820, according to an analysis by NerdWallet, but there are many variables. Ultimately, the buyers walked away. The costly policy andthe potential of rising insurance costs in years to comekilled the deal. Now, the home is back on the market. But with insurance coverage so hard to find, it’s listed for $25,000 less. “It is a very bad situation,” said Monaghan. “What insurers say goes. Even if they have flawed maps or are relying on third-party information. They think it is going to get a lot worse over time.” According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the number and severity of storms are already getting worse. America’s frozen housing market: Sales hit a 13-year low As of October 10, there have been 24 weather and climate disasterswith losses exceeding $1 billion in the United States this year, according to NOAA. These included a drought, two floods, 18 severe storms, one tropical cyclone, one wildfire, and one winter storm. Overall, these events resulted in the deaths of 373 people and had significant economic effects. By comparison, between 1980 and 2022, the typical annual average for events like this was eight. For the most recent five years, theannual average has been 18 events. As climate risks continue, a standoff has developed over who should pay the cost of insuring homes against ever-growing risks. As insurance becomes scarce in some areas and its cost surges, homebuyers are walking away from deals more often than in the past, said Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a personal insurance consumer advocacy group based in San Francisco. Although, she added, this is where the industry has been heading for some time now. “Florida and Louisiana have been having extreme property insurance drama for a while, starting from Hurricane Andrew in 1992, thenHurricane Katrina in 2005,” Bach said. “The severity of the storms and the price tag of the repairs started to get insurers’ attention.” Bach said that in places like Louisiana, insurers were shown the large-scale risk mitigations put in place in the face of more frequent and harsher storms, such as stronger levees. More remote workers are willing to move in order to find affordable housing “But I don’t think they are there yet,” she said. “Insurers are not yet accepting the value of risk reduction. They aren’t able to reduce prices, they aren’t willing to have it impact their underwriting. That is where the heart of the fight lies now.” In the meantime, she said, on top of climate change,other issues are also pushing the risk and cost even higher. “This isn’t just climate change, it is climate-change-plus,” Bach said. It is climate change, plus the Covid hangover pushing costs up,plus inflation, plus technology that allows insurers to evaluate risks in a wider array of ways. Her organization, whose main focus was once helping those impacted by disaster to recover money from insurance companies, is now primarily devoted to working on insurance availability and affordability issues. “It has evolved from a very regional crisis impacting few areas to a much bigger crisis,” said Bach. “We didn’t want to use the word ‘crisis,’ but if you talk to the homeowners in WUI [wildland urban interface] areas they would say it is a crisis.” Still, Bach said, it is important to keep the crisis in perspective. In California, for example, the share ofhomeowners using FAIR plan— the insurer of last resort made up of a syndicated fire insurance pool comprised of all insurers licensed to issue property and casualty in the state — remains under 5%, according to the California Department of Insurance. While insurers have always dropped out of markets or changed their conditions in reaction to a policy, Bach said a competitor would always move in. “Competition would, in fact, heal the wound,” she said. “But that isn’t happening now.” “We are in a world in which natural disasters are more common and more severe, and we are in a state with diverse housing,” said Jennifer Branchini, a Compass agent in Pleasanton and president of the California Association of Realtors. “It is this insurance expense that everyone is now concerned about. Yes, it is expensive to rebuild. What is that doing to the market when it is being put on the homeowner or the person who would like to purchase the house?” In a recent survey of CAR members, only 7% of agents said they had deals fall through. But of those, a whopping 61% said the deal fell through because insurance was not available to the client. An additional 19% fell through because the premium was too expensive. And it isn’t just the lower- or mid-priced homes. Home affordability is the worst it has been since 1984 Branchini heard from a California agent who represented a buyer in the purchase of an $8.2 million property. “The only insurance they could get was through State Farm for $210,000 a year,” she said. “Three days later, State Farm paused new coverage. They lost that insurance. That buyer walked away.” The affordability and availability of insurance is one more thing in the perfect storm of thecurrent rough housing market,said Branchini. “Buyers are facing high interest rates,” she said. “There is already a lack of availability and lack of affordability. And for many of the properties that are on the market you can’t obtain insurance? Or it is very unaffordable insurance?” She remains hopeful that competition and creativity will help the housing market. “We’ll have to see some creative solutions in the near term to create that competitive marketplace for insurance,” she said.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'italy']",us,True,True

Rubkona, a county where floodwaters have permanently submerged entire communities or trapped them on small islands since 2021, is at the very frontline of the flooding and projected to face exceptionally high levels and severity of malnutrition by April 2024. Data from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) shows more than 1.6 million children under five years of age are expected to suffer from malnutrition in 2024. Flood-affected areas are facing the worst malnutrition due to the spread of water borne diseases and crowded conditions, aggravated by limited access to food and livelihoods. ""This is the reality of living on the frontline of the climate crisis,"" warned Mary-Ellen McGroarty, WFP Representative to South Sudan. ""We're seeing an extremely concerning rise in malnutrition which is a direct result of living in overcrowded and waterlogged conditions. The spread of waterborne diseases unravels any work humanitarian agencies do in preventing and treating malnutrition and it is young children who are suffering the impact most severely."" Rubkona is predicted to be in IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 5 by April 2024, for the first time ever. This is the highest possible level and reflects the flood crisis that has submerged the entire county for the past two years, alongside severe economic shocks that have seen the cost of staple foods rise by more than 120 percent since April. The flooding is driven by outflows from Nile River basins, particularly Lake Victoria which received above average rainfall in 2023 - meaning there is no relief from the floodwaters in sight. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is a comprehensive food security and nutrition analysis. The IPC shows more than seven million people will be facing acute food insecurity through the 2024 lean season with the number of people facing catastrophic hunger (IPC5) expected to rise to 79,000 by April. This increase is largely due to South Sudanese returnees fleeing fighting in Sudan, as they will face increasingly extreme levels of food insecurity. WFP is grappling with significant funding constraints and the resourcing outlook for 2024 remains grim, it's expected only one-third of the moderately malnourished children in need of treatment will be reached due to shortage of funds. # # # Full IPC report availablehere The United Nations World Food Programme is the world's largest humanitarian organization saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.","['southsudan', 'southsudan', 'southsudan', 'southsudan', 'sudan']",us,False,False

News and Media Division . New York 6 November 2023 The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General. **Noon Briefing Guest Good afternoon. After you are done with me we will have our guest, Guilherme Canela De Souza Godoi from United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), who will be here to talk to you about the Freedom of Expression and Safety of Journalists. Monica will not be briefing today. **Noon Briefing Guest — Tomorrow Tomorrow, I will be joined by Dr. Natalia Kanem, the Executive Director of the UN Population Fund (UNFPA). She will brief you on the findings of her recent mission to Chad where she met with refugees in the South, where gender-based violence and fistula survivors, as well as women leaders. **Gaza Now, just a few more details about the situation in Gaza. As we speak, Gaza is still under a full electricity blackout. Some 1.5 million people there have been displaced — with more than 700,000 sheltering in United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) shelters — 150 of those UNRWA facilities which are all way over capacity. The sites are overwhelmed, with many people also sleeping outside on the street. UNRWA says that the shelters are hosting newborns, people who are injured and others that are in need of special health-care assistance. Several cases of acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea and chicken pox have also been reported among those sheltering at UNRWA shelters. On Saturday, one UNRWA school in Jabalia camp, north of Gaza, was directly hit by strikes. Fifteen people sheltering in the school were killed and 70 others injured. Yesterday, a limited number of trucks carrying humanitarian supplies crossed into Gaza from Egypt. Since 21 October, more than 450 trucks have delivered food, water, nutrition, health and hygiene supplies, as well as other items. But the entry of fuel — which we've been telling you is desperately needed — is still not allowed. And — as you heard it from theSecretary-Generala few minutes ago, we and our partners have launched a flash appeal to meet surging needs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory through the end of the year. An estimated $1.2 billion will be needed to help deliver life-saving assistance to some 2.7 million men, women and children. I also want to flag that the heads of UN agencies and a number of large international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have issued an urgent appeal for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. In a statement issued, the Principals of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee renewed their plea to the parties to respect their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law. They said all civilians held hostage must be released immediately and unconditionally. Civilians and the infrastructure they rely on must be protected. And more aid must enter into Gaza safely, swiftly and at scale. This afternoon, the Security Council will hold closed consultations on the situation in the Middle East. Tor Wennesland, the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, as well as Martin Griffiths, the Emergency Relief Coordinator. They will provide an overview of our continued efforts to end the suffering and prevent further dangerous escalation throughout the region. We will also get updates on the humanitarian situation. **Nepal I have a couple of statements for you, one onNepal. The Secretary-General is deeply saddened to hear of the loss of life and damage caused by the earthquake, which struck the western province of Karnali in Nepal that took place on Friday. Having just recently returned from Nepal, and with the hospitality and the spirit of the country's people fresh in his heart, the Secretary-General expresses his solidarity with the Government and people of Nepal and extends his sincere condolences to the families of the victims. He also wishes a swift recovery to all those who were injured. The United Nations is working closely with authorities in providing speedy assistance — including food, shelter and medicine — to those affected. **Nepal Humanitarian We and our partners have been providing temporary shelter, food, and non-food items. The World Food Programme (WFP) dispatched 6 metric tons of food to the impacted areas and is providing logistical support to the Government. For its part, the World Health Organization (WHO) has deployed medicines and supplies to meet the primary care needs of 1,000 people. And United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) distributed more than 2,000 emergency shelter sets, with an additional 2,000 sets are on their way to the area and a further 1,000 to Rukum West district. UN-Women is collaborating with women's groups to support community kitchens and provide relief packages. **Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty I also have astatementon the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The Secretary-General deeply regrets the decision by the Russian Federation to revoke its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). Since the Treaty's adoption, Russia has been a leader in seeking to bring the CTBT into force. It is concerning to see a reversal of this trend. The CTBT is critical for international peace and security. It is an essential element of a world free of nuclear weapons. All States, particularly those whose ratification is required for the Treaty's entry into force, should ratify the Treaty without delay or preconditions. In the interim, the nuclear-weapon States should jointly reaffirm their testing moratoriums and commit not to take any actions that would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty. **Mali And an update for you from Mali, our peacekeeping colleagues are telling us that the convoy that left Kidal on 31 October, and is en route to Gao, is continuing its operation in very challenging circumstances both security and logistics-wise. On Saturday, the convoy encountered two other Improvised Explosive Devices near the town of Anéfis. Twenty-two peacekeepers had to be evacuated by air to receive immediate treatment in Gao. This is the sixth incident since the convoy left Kidal. It should be noted that all medical evacuation flights operated without problems. Yesterday, the Mission, following the necessary authorizations granted by the local command of the Malian armed forces, flew resupply flights to provide the convoy with water, fuel, rations and other essential items, and we will keep you updated on their movements. **Myanmar Turning to another part of the world, to Myanmar, I can tell you that we are alarmed by the heavy fighting, particularly in Shan State in the northern part of the country, with reports of artillery shelling and airstrikes that led to civilian casualties and tens of thousands being newly displaced internally, and hundreds across the border. The Secretary-General condemns all forms of violence and reaffirms that civilians should be protected in accordance with international humanitarian law. In line with Security Council Resolution 2669, he urges restraint and de-escalation of tensions, including in the interest of regional stability. And our humanitarian colleagues tell us that, since 26 October nearly 33,000 men, women and children have been displaced. This is causing humanitarian needs to surge. Essential roads are obstructed by checkpoints operated by both sides, while phone and internet services are disrupted. The main airport in Lashio has been closed since the escalation of fighting got underway. We need unimpeded humanitarian access and for red tape to be eliminated so that life-saving aid and services can reach people in need. We urge all parties to the conflict to adhere to international humanitarian law, safeguarding the lives and well-being of civilians and the aid workers trying to assist those civilians. Across Myanmar, 2 million people are now internally displaced, many of them having been uprooted a number of times. As a reminder, the Humanitarian Response Plan for Myanmar is just 28 per cent funded, with only two months left in the year. **Deputy Secretary-General Our Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, today spoke at the International Conference on Women in Islam, that's taking place in Jeddah, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. She said that there is no Islam without women and underscored that from the start, Islam recognized women's right to participate in political decisions, to inherit, to own property and businesses. But many centuries later, in many countries and many areas of life, women have been left behind, she said. Ms. Mohammed said that when women and girls are left behind, we all pay the price: our societies are less peaceful, our economies less prosperous, and our world less just. She urged all leaders at the Conference to listen to and amplify the voices of women in their societies. **Ukraine Turning to Ukraine, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs today warned that the ongoing attacks in many parts of the country are having a horrific impact on civilians — damaging homes, grain facilities, and critical infrastructure as temperatures drop. Over the weekend, there were deadly attacks in southern and central Ukraine, including in the cities of Odesa and Kherson. Sunday's attack in Odesa injured several residents and damaged homes, warehouses and vehicles near the port. Water, electricity and telecommunications services were also disrupted in parts of the city. Our partners are helping to distribute shelter materials to repair damage to structures, as well as cash, legal and psychological support for the impacted families. In the Kherson region, partners are also helping us deliver emergency shelter materials and blankets, mattresses, solar lamps and other items to support front-line communities during the winter months. **Sudan/South Sudan Also, back here this morning, the Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, updated Security Council members on the UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA). He said that the current hostilities in Sudan interrupted the encouraging signs of dialogue between Sudan and South Sudan witnessed earlier in 2023, and it effectively put on hold the political process with regard to the final status of Abyei and other border issues. For her part, Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the African Union, Hanna Tetteh, underscored that her Office will continue engaging with relevant parties to advocate for a comprehensive and simultaneous process that leaves no conflict unaddressed in line with Resolution 2046. **Somalia And a quick update for you from Somalia. Our humanitarian colleagues are telling us that up to 2,400 people are believed to be trapped by rising flood water in Jubaland. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs confirms that at the request of the Deputy Prime Minister of Somalia, UN agencies are working to get maritime equipment to enable local responders to evacuate the stranded civilians. We, our partners and the authorities are mobilizing urgent assistance — including food, shelter and water — to flood affected people. The seasonal rains - which run from October to December — have now intensified, and the flooding is now impacting more than 700,000 men, women and children. More than 110,000 people have been temporarily displaced from their homes, with at least 25 deaths having been reported, that's according to our humanitarian partners. **Yemen Our colleague Hans Grundberg, visited Iran and met with Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, the Iranian Foreign Minister, and other senior Iranian officials. They exchanged views on the importance of making progress to advance an agreement on measures to improve living conditions in Yemen, a sustainable nationwide ceasefire, and the resumption of an inclusive political process under UN auspices. The Special Envoy emphasized the crucial role of the regional and international community in providing sustained support for the effort to achieve a lasting peace which addresses the aspirations of a wide range of Yemeni stakeholders. **Afghanistan And you will have seen that yesterday, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) - together with the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), launched the 2023 Afghan opium survey. It shows that Afghan opium cultivation declined 95 per cent following a drug ban imposed by the de facto authorities in April of last year. The reduction has had immediate humanitarian consequences for many vulnerable communities who had relied on income from cultivating opium. The report calls for urgent humanitarian assistance to help Afghans meet their most basic needs and strong investment in alternative development opportunities. **Senior Personnel Announcement Quick senior personnel appointment for you. The Secretary-General today is appointingRuvendrini Menikdiwelaof Sri Lanka as Assistant High Commissioner for Protection, in the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Menikdiwela will succeed Gillian Triggs of Australia, to whom both the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner Filippo Grande are grateful for her dedicated service to the refugee cause. Menikdiwela, who currently serves as the Director in UNHCR's New York Office, brings to the position several decades of professional experience working for refugees and with refugees, including as UNHCR's Representative in Pakistan and in Thailand, and we congratulate her. **International Day And today is the International Day for Preventing the Exploitation of the Environment in War and Armed Conflict. We attach great importance to ensuring that action on the environment is part of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding strategies, because there can be no durable peace if the natural resources that sustain livelihoods and ecosystems are destroyed. **Questions and Answers Spokesman: Edie? Question: Thank you, Steph. The Secretary-General said and I quote, ""We must act now to find a way out of this brutal, awful, agonizing, dead end of destruction."" Can you tell us specifically what the United Nations is doing to try to achieve this? Is the Secretary-General, Martin Griffiths [Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator], any other high ranking UN officials planning to go to the region? Is the UN planning to initiate any talks? Thank you. Spokesman: One of the, I mean, there are two things: One is to get the humanitarian ceasefire to increase the level of humanitarian aid that's going in; And, as the Secretary-General said before, restore a political horizon for this issue. I don't have any travel to share with you at this point, but when I do, I will share them. Question: Just a quick follow-up. We know from visits to the region that the US Secretary of State has called for humanitarian pauses, not humanitarian ceasefire, which he said would only allow Hamas to rebuild its forces. So, how is the Secretary-General responding to that difficulty? Spokesman: Well, I mean, listen, we're responding to all the difficulties we see across the board by continuing our work and continuing our advocacy. Our aim for a humanitarian ceasefire is exactly that. It's for the violence to stop and for us to be able to deliver more humanitarian goods. Valeria? Question: Thanks, Steph. I think, first of all, that I can speak on behalf of all the UN journalists to, like, really ask if next time the SG [Secretary-General] can stop and answer a couple of our questions. We have many. So my question, what is the SG responding to the ambassador of Israel, what he said yesterday to the CNN not only saying that there is no need for humanitarian pauses, but also there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza? Spokesman: You know, we're not going to play colour commentary on what every person was interviewed on this issue says. I think, our facts and our statements on the humanitarian crisis speak for themselves. Señor. Question: Hi, Steph. The Secretary-General always repeats this slogan or the mantra of the two-state solution. But is he considering to translate the idea into something more concrete with the measures that both parties, Israel and Palestinians have to commit? Spokesman: I mean, he continues to advocate for that political horizon, both in his private conversations and what he says publicly, he continues to believe in it. Toshi? Question: Yeah, I have a quick question on the $1.2 billion humanitarian appeal. What is it now that the access to Gaza is very much restricted, and what is your strategy to get aid delivered right away after you have an access? Spokesman: Well, our strategy is limited by the logistics and the physicality and the fact that fighting is the physicality of things and the geography and things that are continuing. Correspondent: Yeah. But since you're asking for a lot of money, I think it's better for you to explain how you get it ready so that, you know, you have a more understanding of the funding. Spokesman: No. I know. Correspondent: I mean, you can say that you've put out maybe, like, much stuff... I mean, I think the point is to be able to preposition and acquire as much aid as possible so when that aid is able to go in, we are ready. It's all about, you know, the more money we have in advance, the better we are at planning. We also recognize that, you know, there are humanitarian needs across the board. I mean, every time I talk about a humanitarian appeal, I think for just about almost all of them, they are not sufficiently funded, but it is very difficult for the UN to plan and to operationalize humanitarian [operations] without the funding. Question: And a quick follow-up on various. What is the reason for the Secretary-General not to take questions from us on this issue? Spokesman: He will take questions when he feels, at the appropriate time. Dezhi, sorry, whoa. Correspondent: Something wrong today. Spokesman: I don't know what's wrong with me today. Question: Okay. Yeah. Monday. So a follow-up on Toshi's question about that $1.2 billion humanitarian appeal. Can you elaborate a little bit how this number come to, you know, brought this number to life? Like, how you decided it's United States $1.2 billion? Spokesman: I mean, the way these things work is that, through the coordination efforts of our friends at OCHA [United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs], working with all the other agencies, they all kind of come up with a menu of things that they will need, planning for the weeks and months ahead. So it's basically a shopping list. But as you know, all of the UN's humanitarian work is voluntarily funded. And each kind of humanitarian operation has to be funded on its own. There's always access to the Central Emergency Response Fund, which is really used as a spark in a sense to, but it cannot replace actual voluntary contributions. Question: I can understand you said you're first doing this prepositioned shopping list to prepare for humanitarian delivery. But now, with very limited access in from Rafah border crossing to Gaza, does the Secretary-General want to have a second or maybe the third border crossing that those humanitarian... Spokesman: In the best, you know, I don't want to be candid here, but in the best of all possible worlds, there would be more humanitarian access through many different ways. But right now, the only thing that is actually workable is Rafah. Obviously, there are talks about expanding it and getting more access, but this is where we are. Question: But that's only in Rafah? Spokesman: This is where, yes. This is where we are. Question: But not the second border crossing? Spokesman: I mean, we can only deal with the reality that we are, in which we operate. So one last question. Why hasn't Secretary-General talked to Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu yet? Spokesman: He has spoken to... Question: Yeah. But why not... Spokesman: Listen, just give me two seconds and then we can continue this conversation. Correspondent: You'll get there. Spokesman: Okay. I know I will get there. He has spoken to a number of Israeli officials, notably the president. When the time is right I'm sure the phone call will happen, but it's not stopping our efforts in any way. Pam, Linda, and then Dulcie. Question: Steph, is there any reassurances that the UN has from Hamas on their interest in a ceasefire or their ability to actually enforce a ceasefire? There has been information of some short humanitarian pauses from the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] but that Hamas did not agree to. How will you get Hamas onboard to agree to a ceasefire? Spokesman: Well, I mean, you know, there are a lot of different entities and different Member States involved in these conversations. For a ceasefire to work, all sides have to cease fire. Question: But is your understanding that, since you're calling for a ceasefire that both sides have agreed in principle that if they agree to it, they will enforce it? Spokesman: Well, I mean, you know, my understanding is that we're calling for a humanitarian ceasefire, others are calling for... using different words. My understanding is also seeing what keeps happening on the ground. Correspondent: Thank you. Spokesman: Linda, then Dulcie. My question has to do with the use of human shields. The SG called for an end of using human shields. I was just wondering, is there a sense by the UN of how many people have been used as human shields, the impact of, you know, human shields, I mean, the use of human shields perhaps on casualties? No. Sorry. Dulcie, then Yvonne, then Sylviane. Thanks. The peacekeeping convoy that has left Kidal, what country are they from? Spokesman: There are a whole number of different nationalities. It's a mix. Is there one predominant? Spokesman: I don't have that information. I think we'll probably share that information once they've arrived safely. And then on the ceasefire, why doesn't the Secretary-General just call it a ceasefire instead of humanitarian ceasefire? Spokesman: That's our prerogative in a sense. And our aim right now is a humanitarian aim. Question: But wouldn't just a ceasefire, a full ceasefire, get that humanitarian aid in? Spokesman: I will leave that analysis to you. Yvonne, then Sylviane, and Maggie. The number of internally displaced people in Gaza is now around 1.5 million, I understand. Now, the displacement of Palestinian people in the past has often led to permanent displacement. What will the UN do this time to facilitate the return of Palestinians to their homes? Spokesman: Well, I mean, we're, you know, what we're trying to do is get an end to the fighting. And I think no one on the UN end is advocating for mass displacement of Palestinians outside of Gaza. And obviously, I mean, we've been through... Tragically, we've been through these cycles before where you know, there is a... I think and I want to paraphrase, I think Ban Ki-moon, I think in 2014, talked about the vicious cycle of destroy and rebuild. Right? And so there will be a time to rebuild, but there will also... we need to have as well a political horizon, so we don't continue on this cycle. Question: Sorry. But will you be making it clear to all parties that that right of return needs to be applied? Spokesman: The term right of return, I think, in this context, has a specific meaning. We're talking right now about people who are displaced within Gaza. We very much hope, and I know people will want to go home, but homes will have to be rebuilt. Sylviane, then Margaret, then Serife. Correspondent: Thank you, Stephane. Spokesman: Put your microphone a little closer because it's Monday, and I'm hard of hearing. It's about on the killing, the death of four civilians in South Lebanon, including three children, in Israeli bombings. Lebanon filed a complaint today before the UN Security Council. In a statement, the Foreign Minister of Lebanon stressed that this is a war crime. Is this considered a war crime? Spokesman: Look, we are... I'm not in a position to state that. What I can tell you is that we're very concerned about the increased tensions across the Blue Line. It's important that everyone, both sides of the Blue Line, cease any hostile action. We've seen the tragic reports of the four civilians, including three young girls and a woman who were killed in the vicinity of Aitaroun, as well as the one casualty that we've seen reports of in northern Israel. It goes without saying to all the parties on the north and the south side of the Blue Line that civilians should never be targeted and they need to be protected at all cost. Maggie, then Serife, and then we'll move to the gentleman to ask questions. Just a couple of follow-ups. First, the Secretary-General said 89 staff from UNRWA had been killed since 7 October. The latest UNRWA report, which just dropped, like, an hour before he spoke said 88. I just want to be clear if there is a new death. Spokesman: Yeah, that's the number we had received. Correspondent: I'm sorry. Okay. I'm sorry to hear it. I just want to be accurate. Spokesman: Sadly, the numbers are moving forward. Question: Quickly. And then on Sunday, King Abdullah of Jordan tweeted about their air force personnel doing an air drop of medical aid to the Jordanian field hospital in Gaza. I was just wondering if you knew about it in advance and also if air drops are becoming something that you're considering at this point. Spokesman: We've seen the reports that this was done in cooperation between Jordan and Israel. For our part, it is not something we're considering. I mean, air drops from the UN end are sort of a last resort, when all other options have been exhausted. They're also very, very expensive. And it also involves de-confliction. I mean, we've used them in the past I think in Syria, in Deir ez-Zor. If you remember, with WFP a few years ago. It demands a high level of complex de-confliction. And frankly, in Gaza, road access is possible. So we want to be able to expand that road access. Question: And if I could just ask you one more on what the Secretary-General just said. He said hostages and aid shouldn't be linked. The release of the hostages and the aid to Gaza. But then he said the release of the hostages is essential in itself and central to solving many other challenges. So, which is it? Spokesman: Well, I don't read as much contradictory ideas that you do in that. I think obviously, it would help all sorts of other things. But everything that he's called for, and he's said it before, you know, respect for international humanitarian, protection of civilians, humanitarian ceasefire, release of the hostages. Those are all things that are important in and of themselves. And they should not be bargaining chips. Nabil. Oh, sorry and then Serife, Sorry, Sorry, Sorry. You've got to move up to first class too. Correspondent: We fly economy. Spokesman: I know you do. Question: So did the SG discuss opening new crossings with Israel? Spokesman: I mean, this has been a topic of discussion with UN officials and Israeli officials since we tried to get Rafah open a while ago now. Question: And what's your reaction on the threat that came from an Israeli minister? He said that nuclear weapon should be an option to bomb Gaza. Spokesman: First, we saw the remarks. We also saw the fact that he was reprimanded or sanctioned by his own government. I mean, we stand against any sort of rhetoric that inflames an already inflammable situation. Correspondent: Also, the SG said, his appeal covers half a million... Spokesman: A little closer, please. The SG said, his appeal today should cover also half a million Palestinians in the West Bank. So where in the West Bank? And why now he has this...? Spokesman: I mean, we've seen the situation in the West Bank deteriorate. We've seen Palestinians pushed off their agricultural land because of settler violence. And we've seen that violence have a direct impact on their ability to earn a livelihood, which has a knock-on effect on their humanitarian situation. Madame? As the Secretary-General also mentioned, the civilian casualties are rising. Hospitals, schools, and civilian infrastructures are continuing to be targets. And with a very heavy heart, I would like to tell you that my colleague in Gaza, Anadolu's cameraman, has lost his four children and three family members as a result of Israeli airstrikes. I believe the Secretary-General has the authority to establish a commission of inquiry or a fact based finding mission if he believes that serious violations of international humanitarian law are taking place. Does he plan to do this to counter the impunity? Spokesman: First of all, we extend our condolences to your colleague who is not the first journalist, sadly, to have lost family or loved ones in Gaza. The Secretary-General, in order to launch an investigation, would need a mandate from a legislative body in the UN. Stefano? Question: Two questions. One, when the Secretary-General spoke the last time with President Biden? Spokesman: When did he speak last to President Biden? I'd have to check. But you would ask me... The pope did call him about 10 days ago. You would ask me. Correspondent: No. Yes. Spokesman: And I'm not kidding. I mean, I just want you to know because you had asked me about the Pope as well. Question: No. But that's formulated differently. Since the war in Gaza, since all this, since 7 October, did the Secretary-General ever speak with President Biden? But he's spoken to Antony Blinken numerous times. He's spoken to Jake Sullivan numerous times. So I think he... but he has [been] very engaged in detailed conversations with relevant United States officials. Question: I understand. He just told us that this is a crisis, a crisis of humanity. And for that, this was so important that to speak with the most important leader in the world will be important. Another question, does the UN is aware that there is on Twitter or X, there are images of Eritrean refugees in Libya being tortured in camps? Spokesman: We have not seen... Question: Where they ask for money for release these people. Apparently, their organization that tells to the UN, please to intervene, to do something. Is this something going, I mean, that the UN is aware of what's going on in the last days? Spokesman: I mean, I haven't seen the particular reports. I think we've been very, very clear and detailed in our condemnation and highlighting the horrendous plight of migrants and refugees who were stuck in Libya, including the violence they've had to endure. Yes, sir. Question: Since the Russian invasion, millions of Ukrainians displaced, and since the Turkish invasion in northeast Syria, 80 per cent of the Kurds displaced in Afrin. In less than few weeks, more than a million displaced in Gaza plus airstrikes targeting church in Ukraine, in Nagorno Karabakh, you know, more than 120,000 Armenians displaced. So I wonder if Secretary-General is optimistic or pessimistic about the future of humanity or civilization. I'm sorry. Spokesman: That's okay. I think, you know, the Secretary-General is if anything, he's a realist. I think he is saddened by what we're seeing around the world, but he remains highly, highly determined to continue the good fight. Sir, and then we'll go to Caitlin, then we'll go to the gentleman in front. My name is Alex. Given the ongoing conflict in Gaza, and the repeated pleas and warnings from the UN Secretary-General, what contingency plans or additional measures does the United Nations have in place should a ceasefire not be achieved and the conflict persist? Spokesman: Well, I mean, we're, you know, you hope for the best and plan for the worse, as the saying goes. I mean, we're again very realistic about what is going on, but we will continue to advocate for the humanitarian ceasefire. We will continue to advocate for greater humanitarian access, and our staff in Gaza will continue to stand with all the civilians in Gaza and trying to help them in as much as they possibly can. Caitlin? Question: Sorry if I missed a readout, but you said the Pope called the Secretary-General about 10 days ago? Spokesman: I did. Question: But what did they talk about? You didn't miss a readout. I just couldn't help it when Stefano mentioned, but he did. This was last week to discuss the situation in the Middle East. Question: Did they come to any conclusion? Spokesman: I mean, not that I'm aware. I don't know if conclusion is the right word. But, no, not that I'm aware of. Sir. Just wait one second, please, Stefano and then I'll go to round two. Question: Thank you. This is Lovlu Ansar from Bangladesh Pratidin. I have two questions. One for Bangladesh. The Election Commission is in dialogue with the main political parties to meet the demands of the fair elections in Bangladesh. But main opposition, BNP, did not attend the dialogue held on 4 November. BNP has given a blockade programme after the [inaudible] in the name of [inaudible]. Several people, including a police officer, already died and after the [inaudible], the name of movement... Spokesman: Sorry. What is the question? They did not participate Election Commission's dialogue, but they are demanding for fair election. Spokesman: Well, I can't speak to why, I mean, I don't have the details. I can't speak to why one party did not attend the dialogue. What I can tell you is that we very much hope for a fair and free elections in Bangladesh, free of violence. And as we said, we've expressed our concern about the large number of people who've been arrested. Your second question. That's on the Middle East. Talks have to stop Israeli attacks on Gaza. Many are commenting on this process of discussion as an excuse of waste of time. Does the United Nations have any other plans to take effective action to calm the overall situation in the Middle East? Spokesman: Well, I mean, it depends which part of the United Nations you're speaking of. I think there are parts of this organization that could probably be doing more. For his part, the Secretary-General is very focused on continuing to advocate everything that he's spoken about at length earlier today. I'm going to go to Iftikhar and then I'll come back to the room. My question was asked by Maggie about Jordanian humanitarian operations in Gaza. What I would like to ask you now is whether the Secretary-General would encourage other countries to do the same operation? Spokesman: I mean, we're not calling for air drops in Gaza. What we are calling for, for the reasons that I outlined, we are calling for greater humanitarian access by road so that's where we are. Dezhi, then Edie, and then we'll go to our guests. Question: Very short question. The French President, Mr. [Emmanuel] Macron said that he will have a humanitarian conference on 9 November. Will the UN have anybody to participate in that? Spokesman: We'll be represented there in one way or another. I don't have the details yet. Edie? Question: Also a quick question. The Gaza Ministry of Health said today that the number of people killed has topped 10,000 and that number includes both civilians and military. The UN officials have said about two thirds of the victims, those killed were women and children. Is that's still the UN's belief? Spokesman: I don't have any new information on that, but I will check with those who are closer to the numbers than I am. And just another quick follow-up on the Mali convoy. I think you said Friday that the convoy was expected to arrive at the end of the weekend. Any due date? Spokesman: Well, I mean, part of the challenge is, again, two other IEDs [improvised explosive devices] and, you know, close to 20 people who were injured. All of that takes time, and it slows the convoy down. Thank you for your patience. Guilherme, are you able to hear me? Do we have our guest from Paris? Question: Yes. Here I am. Spokesman: Hi. Hi. Great. Thank you very much.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'chad', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'egypt', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'russia', 'russia', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'iran', 'iran', 'saudiarabia', 'tanzania', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'southsudan', 'ethiopia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'yemen', 'yemen', 'afghanistan', 'afghanistan', 'not found', 'not found', 'australia', 'pakistan', 'pakistan', 'thailand', 'us', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'jordan', 'syria', 'syria', 'syria', 'southafrica', 'southafrica', 'libya', 'libya', 'bangladesh', 'bangladesh', 'bangladesh']",us,True,False

Called regenerative landscape design (RLD), the approach was recently developed by a multi-institution collaboration led by Penn State researchers to enhance sustainability and better address complex and interconnected environmental and social challenges, such as climate change, biodiversity loss and social inequality.Erica Smithwick, a distinguished professor of geography in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, is the lead author of the paper, which was published in the journalEcology and Society.""The socio-environmental challenges that we face today are intricately intertwined,"" Smithwick said. ""However, the existing frameworks that strive to bring about change in areas such as resilience,landscape ecology, architecture, agriculture and geography are often compartmentalized and disciplinary. They often fall short of adequately addressing the social and scientific intricacies. Regenerative landscapedesignintegrates a cross section of knowledge systems that guides solutions to resilient and stabilized answers that truly benefit people.""Smithwick said the three elements of RLD—regenerative systems, landscape approaches and collaborative design—have been individually explored in multiple disciplines, but this is the first time they were analyzed collectively. The research team's effort resulted in the development of RLD, a framework to guide intentional collaboration aimed at improving both the environment and society and to address the shortfalls of siloed approaches, according to Smithwick.The intention, Smithwick said, is that researchers can apply RLD to complex, interconnected environmental andsocial challengesto develop solutions that are inclusive, comprehensive and scalable.In a regenerative system, the changes that are made result in more giving than taking and a net positive toward a desirable outcome—it is a step beyond sustainability.Landscape approaches allow for managing social-ecological systems because landscapes are large enough to capture the relationships between people and the environment, but small enough to be manageable. Landscapes also display social patterns and connect different disciplines.Lastly, the focus on design—specifically co-design—emphasizes cooperation and facilitated teamwork. Landscapes are made up of various parts that work together, and they can be fashioned in a way that improves the environment.Co-author Lisa Iulo, associate professor of architecture and director of the Hamer Center for Community Design, said RLD allows people to create positive environmental and societal change together.""Regenerative landscape design works with affected communities to address complex and interconnected challenges,"" Iulo said. ""RLD defines a process for people to design collaboratively. It brings together multiple disciplines with community experts to ensure research questions are grounded in the reality of place, establishing local and globally applicable solutions for regenerative built environments. RLD is inclusive and enlightening, recognizing people as an integral part of the landscape.""Leland Glenna, a professor of rural sociology and science, technology and society in the College of Agricultural Sciences, is also a co-author on the paper. He said the deficit model, which suggests the public is disconnected from such work because they do not understand or know enough to support the science, is a top-down approach that can fall short when developing solutions.""Social and biophysical scientists are increasingly recognizing that the deficit model fails to capture why lay audiences might fail to understand or even resist efforts to promote societal change that would promote regenerative ecological outcomes,"" Glenna said. ""Regenerative landscape design operates on the premise that two-way communication is needed between experts and stakeholders to fully understand the social, ethical and biophysical dimensions of problems and to develop comprehensive strategies for solving problems.""In addition to changes toresearch methods, the structure that supports the research enterprise needs to evolve, according to Smithwick, who is also the associate director of the Institute of Energy and the Environment.""The mechanisms that are currently in place to review, fund and implement research are limited in how they can acknowledge or support co-design approaches such as RLD,"" she said. ""The system must be able to recognize that there are alternative ways of knowing, including Indigenous worldviews and alternative solutions outcomes.""In the paper, the team provided examples of how regenerative landscape design could be applied in practice around the world. In the Chesapeake Bay area, the framework could be used to restore oyster reefs and other coastal habitats. In the example, intertwined issues such as extreme weather and flooding, regional economic needs, cultural and historical values and water quality are addressed collectively.The research team explained how RLD could provide opportunities for collaborative design of optimal land-use plans that restore and enhance water quality while adding value to communities through flood protection. They also shared how participatory research with landowners could help identify the social, environmental and economic goals of potential restoration activities.In Kenya, the researchers said, RLD could be used to create more sustainable agropastoral landscapes, which is land that accommodates both growing crops and raising livestock. In this example, the research team described systems that not only withstand future challenges like locust plagues orclimate change, but also actively work towards a better state by addressing past land-use mistakes and considering both social andenvironmental factors.""Regenerativelandscapedesign is a new frontier in systems science, one that is rooted in collaboration, ethics and a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of social and natural systems,"" Smithwick said. ""It is a call to action for us to work together to create landscapes that are more resilient, equitable and sustainable.""",['kenya'],gb,False,False

The increased global temperatures this year are linked to man-made emissions, scientists say, as well as the naturally-occurring El Nino weather system, which warms surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. CS3 said in a statement that 2023 is“virtually certain”to break the previous record set in 2016, which was also an El Nino year. The only other time on record in which global surface air temperatures exceeded expectations by such a large margin was September 2023. Researchers have indicated that extreme temperatures are expected to persist in 2024. “When we combine our data with the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), we can say that this is the warmest year for the last 125,000 years,”Burgess said, adding that she was“really, really surprised”by the findings. The uptick in global temperatures directly corresponds to an increase in human suffering, according to Dr. Friederike Otto from Imperial College London. “Within this year, extreme heatwaves and droughts, made much worse by these extreme temperatures, have caused thousands of deaths, people losing their livelihoods, being displaced, etc.”he said, as per the BBC on Wednesday.“These are the records that matter.” Scientists have blamed man-made climate change for a series of disasters which have happened throughout 2023, including floods that killed thousands in Libya, South American heatwaves and Canada’s worst-ever season of forest fires - which Piers Foster, a climate scientist at the UK’s University of Leeds, warned could become commonplace. “We must not let the devastating floods, wildfires, storms, and heatwaves seen this year become a new normal,”he said via Reuters, explaining that by“rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions”the rate of warming can be halved. The topic is expected to dominate the UN’s COP28 climate change summit, set to begin in Dubai on November 30.","['senegal', 'libya', 'canada', 'uk', 'unitedarabemirates']",ru,False,False

Somalis are struggling to cope with never-before-seen flooding that has killed dozens of people and forced hundreds of thousands to abandon their homes, in the wake of extreme rainfall that has engulfed much of East Africa. Following days of heavy torrents, at least 29 people have been killed and more than 300,000 have fled their homes for safety, Somalia’s National Disaster Management Agency (SoDMA) said on Wednesday, calling the phenomenon the most severe in “decades”. “What is going on today is the worst for decades,” said Hassan Isse, managing director of SoDMA. “I do not remember such floods in my life,” said Mohamed Farah, a local elder in Baidoa city, in southwest Somalia. “People keep on evacuating looking for high ground.” The extreme rain presents a new challenge for the Horn of Africa country, which is still reeling from a record drought that crippled its agriculture andkilledas many as 43,000 people last year. Now, Somali authorities are searching for thousands that may be stranded by the floodwater. At least 2,400 people have been cut off in Luuq town alone after the Jubba River burst its banks, the United Nations has warned. “Our makeshift shelters are washing away. Children are missing now. We don’t know whether they are dead or alive”, Fadumo Abdulkadir, who is displaced by the flooding, told Al Jazeera. The flooding in Somalia is part of a regional deluge linked to ongoing weather patterns known as El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole — which impact ocean surface temperatures and cause extreme rainfall, experts say. “The impact of the flooding is much worse because the soil is so damaged from an unprecedented recent drought – years of conflict and al-Shabab militia’s presence also makes building flood defences and resilience more complex and costly”, said Nazanine Moshiri, a climate analyst at the International Crisis Group. The phenomenon has sparked turmoil in neighbouring states Kenya and Ethiopia. In Kenya, torrential downpours over the weekendkilledat least 15 people, while destroying 97 hectares (240 acres) of farmland and wiping out more than 1,000 livestock animals, the Kenya Red Cross Society reported Sunday. Thousands are also reportedly displaced in the Somali region of Ethiopia due to ongoing flooding. Scientists say climate change is causing more intense and more frequent extreme weather events, with the Horn of Africa especially vulnerable. “This cycle of flooding and drought is going to continue. And we’re going to see more and more of this unless we do something on a global scale,” Christophe Hodder, a climate security advisor at the United Nations Environment Programme told Al Jazeera.

Net profit for the equity holders, EPS and return on equity figures include results from life operations. Mandatum is classified as discontinued operations as of 31 March 2023.*) To enhance comparability, a Group profit before taxes (P&C operations) figure adjusted for IFRS 9, reflecting market value movements, has been provided for the prior year. The figures in this report have not been audited. Sampo Group key financial targets for 2021-2023 The pro forma figures reflect the partial demerger and related transactions. GROUP CEO’S COMMENT During the third quarter we saw a continuation of the trends observed earlier in 2023. We delivered excellent premium growth of 12 per cent on a currency adjusted basis, the pricing environment in the UK motor insurance market continued to improve and higher interest rates supported investment income. Profit before taxes increased to EUR 1,113 million (627), after adjusting for IFRS 9. Operationally, our focus was on supporting our customers, as rain and flooding led to severe weather claims of approximately EUR 90 million. Private lines is the part of our business, together with SME, where we see the greatest potential to create value for our customers and shareholders through investments in digital capabilities. Over 2023, the benefits have been visible; digital sales in Nordic Private are up 9 per cent year-on-year, retention remains excellent at 90 per cent and the share of online claims increased to 60 per cent. Being the leading digital P&C insurer in the Nordics also supports growth – Private premiums grew by 6.3 per cent in the third quarter, on a currency adjusted basis, or 7.8 per cent excluding the Swedish mobility business. Private personal insurance was particularly strong, with growth of 12 per cent. Profitability remains very robust in Private as it delivered a nine-month combined ratio of 82.7 per cent, despite elevated weather claims. Turning to Hastings, another of our digitally focused operations, the UK motor insurance market environment continued to improve over the third quarter. Monthly price increases were in the mid-single digits while claims inflation remained high, but stable. In this environment, Hastings continued to firmly prioritise profitability, but still managed to grow motor insurance customer count slightly. Combined with strong growth in home insurance, this enabled Hastings to grow nine-month currency adjusted GWP by 32 per cent year-on-year. With an operating ratio of 90.5 per cent for the first nine months, it is on track to reach the 88-90 per cent guidance range for 2023, while carrying strong operational momentum into 2024. In the Nordics, the competitive environment continued to be broadly stable in Private and Commercial, while the Industrial market remained in the hard part of the underwriting cycle. Nordic claims inflation showed signs of moderation in the third quarter as it fell to the lower end of the 4-5 per cent range observed over 2023, while claims frequency developed in line with expectations. We continued to implement rate increases ahead of total claims cost development. The trend in underlying margins remained strong, as If P&C improved its nine-month undiscounted adjusted risk ratio by 0.5 percentage points year-on-year, and its cost ratio by 0.1 percentage points. The third quarter saw elevated weather claims related to storm Hans, heavy rainfall in Oslo and other, smaller events across the Nordic region. As a large and well diversified insurer, with a strong balance sheet, we are able to help our customers through such events promptly and reliably. Although the occurrence of large weather events appears stochastic, shareholders can expect us to monitor related claims trends vigilantly and to underwrite and price the risk conservatively. It is important to remember that our policies provide coverage for periods of 12 months, allowing us to review price adequacy annually. Looking to the asset side of the balance sheet, Sampo delivered a net investment income of nearly EUR 500 million in the first nine months. The short duration of our fixed income portfolio has allowed us to reinvest rapidly, pushing the running yield in If P&C to over 4 per cent from 1.5 per cent at the end of 2021. On 2 October 2023, we completed the spin-off of Mandatum by listing it on Nasdaq Helsinki. I am pleased to see that the listing has been well received by the market and I am excited to take Sampo forward as a pure P&C insurance group. Torbjörn MagnussonGroup CEOOUTLOOK Outlook for 2023 Sampo Group’s P&C insurance business is expected to achieve underwriting margins that meet the annual targets set for 2021–2023. At Group level, Sampo targets a combined ratio of below 86 per cent, while the targets set for its fully owned P&C insurance subsidiaries, If P&C and Hastings, are below 85 per cent and below 88 per cent, respectively. The outlook for 2023 remains unchanged from that communicated with the Sampo Group Half-Year Financial Report; If P&C is expected to achieve a combined ratio of 81.5 - 83.5 per cent and Hastings an operating ratio of 88 - 90 per cent. The combined and operating ratios of Sampo Group’s P&C insurance operations are subject to volatility driven by, among other factors, seasonal weather patterns, large claims and prior year development. These effects are particularly relevant for individual segments and business areas, such as the Danish and UK operations. The net financial result will be significantly influenced by capital markets’ developments.

Now, under more difficult conditions in the western Kenyan region of Nambale, she's seeing her own fields flourish. This is thanks to switching to sustainable farming practices and joining a new scheme rolled out by carbon-credit startupBoomitra, and an international agricultural alliance. (Boomitra will help Hannah earn extra income for the carbon sequestered on her farm due to her smart agricultural practices by selling those carbon credits to companies seeking to offset emissions.) A continent away in India, another smallholder farmer, Chayya Kundlik Raosurse, is reaping the benefits of another cutting-edge scheme: solar-powered dryers supplied by another development startup,S4S Technologies(S4S). These machines process her perishable produce, prolonging their shelf and market life. The two farmers are benefiting from green innovations that are now getting global recognition. For Boomitra and S4S are winners in the third annualEarthshot Prizeannounced in Singapore today (7 November),winning in the 'Fix Our Climate' and 'Build a waste-free world' categories respectively. Launched by Britain's Prince William in 2020, Earthshot awards US$1.2 million to five winners developing solutions to environmental problems. Finalists get to enter a Fellowship programme giving them the mentorship and technical support they need to scale up their projects. Both Boomitra and S4S Technologies are supported by the World Food Programme (WFP)Innovation Accelerator, which aims to support high-impact innovations to help end hunger. With its vast global network, Innovation Accelerator can foster new partnerships among companies, governments and nongovernmental groups, attracting financial support for innovations to increase their scale and impact. Through their groundbreaking innovations, Boomitra and S4S are helping farmers and entire communities build resilience to climate change, which is delivering a devastating blow to some of the poorest communities in low-income countries. Below we look at how. Kenya: Healthy soils tackle climate-related effects Farmer Hannah Karanja's seen the fallout of extreme weather firsthand. Kenya emerged, this year, from one of its worst droughts on record only to be hit by heavy rains and flash floods, which displaced households and damaged critical infrastructure such as roads and bridges. ""In my childhood the weather patterns were steady, the rains came at specific times, and so our parents knew when to plant and when to harvest,"" says Hannah. ""But now the climate is very unstable. If you do not take the right measures, you will not have a good harvest."" Four years ago, in a bid to keep her farm sustainable and profitable, Hannah began farming using regenerative methods aimed at building healthy soil that is more resistant to drought, heat and other climate impacts. Reaping by hand instead of ploughing, for example, results in healthier soil that is not disturbed so much. By rotating the types of crops she plants, she ensures no single variety drains her fields of critical nutrients. In 2022, Hannah joined an effort by Boomitra and the Farm to Market Alliance (a farmer-focused public-private consortium) to pilot a carbon-credit system inKenya. WFP connected the two groups to scale up Boomitra's innovation, which uses satellite and AI technology to help monitor, report, and verify carbon removal credits. Farmers such as Hannah are paid for the carbon they remove from the atmosphere through healthy soil practices. Changing the way she farms has doubled Hannah's yields and seen her revenues soar, allowing her to pay for her children's schooling and other expenses. She will soon receive additional revenue from the carbon-credit scheme. ""It's from this farm that even my last child went to the university, graduated and is now a lawyer,"" she says. ""My second-last child is an engineer and now I even teach my grandchildren this method of farming."" India: Empowering women farmers In India, 70 percent of rural households depend on agriculture to make a living. Collaborating with local authorities, banks, and nongovernmental groups, with WFP support S4S provided micro-loans to female smallholder farmers in western Maharashtra state, enabling them to buy solar-powered dryers and food processing equipment. ""In the last decade, extreme heat affected the quality of our produce,"" farmer Chayya says, referring to irregular weather linked to climate change that is only expected to intensify. ""With S4S, we process harvests that would otherwise go to waste."" Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox By submitting above, you agree toour privacy policy.

""Through the work of S4S in Maharashtra state, we realized the critical importance of collaborating with all stakeholders and WFP to build meaningful relationships,"" says S4S co-founder Nidhi Pant, adding such relationships ""enhance our efficiency by pooling skills, knowledge, and resources."" Bernhard Kowatsch, head of the WFP's Innovative Accelerator, believes S4S's most exciting feature is its potential to scale up, with ""private investments for this social business working hand-in-hand with local governments in India and women entrepreneurs.""

AfterCovid-19induced lockdown and floods, now the latest trouble adding to their mounting losses is the influx of cheap flowers from neighboring states including Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh among others, that too in the peak of festive season. The PAU Flower Growers Club, an association of flower farmers in Punjab, have now written to state horticulture minister Chetan Singh Jouramajra, urging his immediate intervention. The farmers have also asked that while the government claims to be giving a push to diversification, why are they been given a single penny of compensation for losses suffered during natural calamities (floods and untimely rains) like other farmers who grow wheat and paddy. “Punjab flower growers are facing a big challenge due to cheaper produce being brought from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan etc. Local growers are selling their produce for peanuts despite better quality. The cost of production is also higher in Punjab due to costly labour, irrigation etc whereas states like Haryana and UP offer higher subsidies, cheap labor etc due to which their farmers can afford to sell at lower rates. They are selling flowers in Punjab at lower rates which is causing problems for local farmers,” read the letter undersigned by Gurpreet Singh Shergill, president, PAU Flower Growers Club. The letter states that Punjab’s flower growers have three major demands: 1) Market regulation: Impose tax on flower growers coming from other states especially marigold sellers so that they don’t spoil market for local growers due to their cheap rates 2) Impose complete ban on plastic flowers and ensure usage of fresh flowers in government programmes 3) Setup a flower mandi (marketplace), preferably inLudhiana, where growers can sell their produce at competitive rates. Farmers further wrote that their demand for flower mandi in Punjab has been lying pending since more than a decade. The flower growers from border districts including Fazilka and Ferozepur have also submitted memorandums to their local MLAs and deputy commissioners stating that it has become difficult for local farmers to sell their produce due to the arrival of cheap product from UP, Rajasthan, Haryana, West Bengal (Kolkata) etc. “Not just this, but poor farmers from border districts are also facing immense problems in transportation. We want a marketplace in Ludhiana, which is the hub of high-end marriages and other events, to sell our produce. Flowers are being brought from other states and government is not intervening at all to give preference to local farmers. We also want Punjab Roadways buses to help us in ferrying flowers to Ludhiana and other districts from border areas,” said Joginder Deep Singh, a farmer from Mamdot of Fazilka. “It is only on the instructions of the Punjab government, that for the last 10 years, some farmers like us started cultivating flowers leaving the traditional crops.

DND/CAF manages an extensive portfolio of real estate, air, land and maritime fleets required for the defence of Canada. The DND/CAF Climate Resilience and Environmental Sustainability Science and Technology (CRESST) Strategy outlines how DND/CAF's science and technology activities will be guided toward achieving our environmental and energy targets, and anticipating and mitigating the impacts of climate change, so that DND/CAF can continue to protect Canadians. The CRESST Strategy guides science and technology activities through 10 action areas organized under three strategic objectives: Outcomes are divided into short term (one to five years), medium term (five to 10 years) and long term (10+ years). Our institution believes strongly in the importance of innovation to help us meet our climate-related commitments. DND/CAF will review the CRESST Strategy periodically to ensure that it remains fit-for-purpose, and up to date. Like all federal institutions, National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces have an important role to play in achieving federal emissions targets. Meeting our climate commitments will help fight climate change, and protect the safety and security of Canadians, who are seeing the impacts of climate change in the form of forest fires, floods, hurricanes and more. ""The Canadian Armed Forces have been on the front lines of the fight against climate change, by responding to forest fires, floods, and emergencies across Canada. It is crucial that National Defence takes measures to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and environmental footprint, in order to mitigate the security threat posed by climate change. By ensuring that DND/CAF's science, technology and innovation activities directly address climate change and environmental impacts, we are helping to ensure the safety of Canadians."" The Honourable Bill Blair, Minister of National Defence The CRESST strategy builds on existing DND/CAF efforts including theDefence Energy and Environment Strategy. National Defence has a target of reducing our GHG emissions by 40 percent by 2025, five years ahead of schedule, which will contribute to the federal government's target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Energy Performance Contract projects have been completed in Greenwood, Esquimalt, Petawawa, and more. EPC projects are underway at Comox, Borden, Kingston, Shilo, Halifax, Alert, and Bagotville. Similar contracts are in development for additional bases across Canada. Once the EPC projects underway are completed, we expect to reduce our annual energy costs by nearly $20 million per year and reduce our emissions by over 64,000 tonnes annually.","['canada', 'canada', 'canada', 'canada', 'canada', 'canada', 'unitedstates', 'jamaica', 'palestinianterritories', 'australia']",us,True,False

Authorities have scrambled to rescue thousands of stranded people from the floodwater, which comes on the heels of the region's worst drought in 40 years. ""What is going on today is the worst for decades. It is worse than even the 1997 floods,"" said Hassan Isse, managing director of the Somali Disaster Management Agency (SOMDA). The death toll and numbers of people displaced were likely to rise further, Isse said, because many people were trapped by floodwaters. ""I do not remember such floods in my life,"" said Mohamed Farah, a local elder in Baidoa city, in southwest Somalia. ""People keep on evacuating looking for high ground."" At least 2,400 people have been cut off in Luuq town, where the Jubba River burst its banks, the United Nations has said. ""Luuq is surrounded by the river and floods are threatening us. People keep fleeing out of the town. Some are still trapped. Our shops have been washed away,"" said Ahmed Nur, a trader in Luuq. Floods in neighbouring Kenya have killed at least 15 people and submerged a bridge in Uganda, cutting off a road linking Kampala to oilfields in the northwest, the Kenya Red Cross and Uganda's road authority said. The regional deluge was caused by the combined effect of two weather phenomenons, El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole, said Nazanine Moshiri, a climate analyst at the International Crisis Group. El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole are climate patterns that impact ocean surface temperatures and cause above-average rainfall. ""The impact of the flooding is much worse because the soil is so damaged from an unprecedented recent drought - years of conflict and al Shabaab militia's presence also makes building flood defences and resilience more complex and costly,"" Moshiri said. Scientists say climate change is causing more intense and more frequent extreme weather events. In response, African leaders have proposed new global taxes and reforms to international financial institutions to help fund climate change action.","['somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'sweden', 'kenya', 'uganda', 'uganda']",in,False,False

The UN has released $25m (£20.5m) in aid, describing the floods as a ""once-in-a-century event."" Authorities say at least 29 people have been killed and more than 300,000 displaced, with more rain to come. Somalia and neighbouring countries in East Africa have been hit by heavy rains since early October. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the downpours had been worsened by the combined impact of two climate phenomena - El Niño and the more localised Indian Ocean Dipole, referring to differences in sea surface temperature in opposite parts of the ocean. The agency warned that some 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million acres) of farmland could potentially be destroyed. Martin Griffiths, the UN's Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief coordinator, said: ""Extreme weather linked to the ongoing El Niño risks further driving up humanitarian needs in already-vulnerable communities in Somalia and many other places."" ""We know what the risks are, and we need to get ahead of these looming crises."" The UN humanitarian agency said rescue efforts were being delayed because roads had been cut. Aid groups have also warned that camps for people displaced by an Islamist insurgency and the recent drought had also been flooded, causing people to flee for a second time. OCHA warned on Wednesday that more rain is expected in the coming days, and that the forecast shows very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall is expected in southern Somalia. Somalia is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, and the country is experiencing heavier than normal rains after emerging from one of its worst droughts in four decades. The flooding began last month after heavy rains raised water levels and caused the overflowing of the Juba and Shabelle rivers. Flash floods have also killed dozens of people in neighbouring Kenya and Ethiopia. Earlier this week, Somalia declared an emergency in the most-affected states - Jubbaland, Hirshabelle South West and Galmudug. OCHA said in September that East Africa was likely to encounter heavier than normal rains over the October-December period because of the El Niño phenomenon. El Niño is caused by the Pacific Ocean warming and is linked to flooding, cyclones, drought, and wildfires. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.","['somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'sweden', 'sweden', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'kenya']",gb,False,False

[+] properties due to climate events. For most of the U.S. population, summarizing a home as shelter is a fairly gross underrepresentation of what a home actually delivers, but now many are looking for shelter from more extreme climate events that are capable of reducing our current housing to underperforming shelters. While the challenges have always existed, global real estate data platform CoreLogic reports ever-increasing risks and that now more than 18 million properties valued at $8 trillion are at extreme risk. There are mechanisms in place for protection, such as building codes, insurance, better forecasting, and new design with better performing materials, however, even these mechanisms are proving to have failure points, and sometimes major gaps. Growing Risks Risks are defined in many ways, and to make things even more complicated, housing stakeholders look at them through completely different lenses. A home insurance company evaluates risk differently than the builder, who is different than the homeowner, who is different than the architect. These disparities certainly don’t help the situation, but at the same time, none of the stakeholders can argue with the looming danger of stronger weather events. CoreLogic’s data analyzes property-level physical attributes, property-level financial data, specific peril impacts, and a variety of climate scenarios, to understand the current and future financial impact. The company’s data also takes the age of the housing stock into account, making both granularity and scale important in the outputs. “What CoreLogic does is identify the financial risk for every property in the U.S.,” said Anand Srinivasan, who acts as executive of innovation at CoreLogic. “If the property is greater than 100 square feet, then we have calculated loss estimates and created risk scores that incorporate present and future climate risk. Now, we are getting demand from government officials to look at longer periods because of capital investments.” The data provides a holistic view of all potential hazards, including floods, hurricane winds, wildfires, severe convective storms, severe winter storms, along with earthquake activity. From there, the data can help identify the top risks in financial terms by looking at potential loss, making CoreLogic a useful tool for insurance companies and mortgage originators in underwriting and financial evaluations of properties and policies and portfolios of properties. The data is comprehensive and overwhelming, but the value of the data is critical to all the stakeholders. “We look at the delineation between coverage amount and the mortgage amount, the home value, the equity value, and the reconstruction costs,” Srinivasan said. “And, they all are moving targets, but it helps articulate the risk and then helps define actions on what could be done to reduce the risk and has an impact on what the owner would do.” There are dozens of examples. For instance, the Federal Reserve Board has published a paper using CoreLogic data to identify what destroys a community, defined by the tipping point for consumers to walk away from their damaged property because the damage is too extensive. There have already been instances when a homeowner would choose to use their insurance payment to pay off any remaining loan and then walk away. This sort of data could be the catalyst for a community renovation, funding or what has tragically happened, insurance leaving the area. To understand the data a little better, CoreLogic defines “extreme risk” properties as those having a climate risk score of greater than or equal to 70 out of 100 in any time horizon, or as having a shift in climate risk score between any two time horizons of greater than or equal to 40. Top metrics discussed here include all risks together, but are defined for each peril as well, and exceeding the limit for any one of them defines the property as extreme. The company also uses the term “grave danger” to highlight the magnitude of properties and dollars concentrated in these geographies when compared to the majority of other geographies in the U.S., but has not yet refined their criteria as detailed as “extreme risk.” The data also can be represented over different time horizons to capture a future spike, such as a flood in an area currently suffering a long period of drought, which again could be a catalyst for a community retrofit project. In CoreLogic’s analysis of all markets across the U.S. of extreme risk properties, the reconstruction cost or the dollars needed to rebuild the home in a total loss event, and the total home values or what the home would sell for today, it reports a total of 18 million properties valued at $8 trillion with California, Florida and Texas each carrying between 2.5 and 3.8 million homes. The value at risk in the Miami area is the highest in the country and so are the property counts. Of all the extreme risk properties in the country, about 12% of the units and the value reside in Miami today at 1 million homes with $$814 billion in value, and that risk remains strong over time. The San Francisco area has a slightly lower share of extreme risk houses, but the properties are valued higher on a per house basis, with half a million homes with $600 billion in value at risk. The same goes for San Jose, with 333,000 homes valued at $450 billion and Los Angeles with 383,000 homes valued at $356 billion. Texas is experiencing the opposite phenomenon with a higher percentage of homes at risk, but that are valued lower. So, the highest value of destruction is in the three California cities and the highest population impacted would be in the Dallas and Houston areas. With no mitigation to increase property resiliency with increases in climate risk, a risk score will change from 15 to 54 out of 100 by 2050. Nearly 300,000 model runs of impacts are replicated on the property to project average loss rate in a single year. Risk scores provide a normalized method to easily compare risk across geographies and time without having to do all the math, and an additional score is used to calculate dollars of loss based on the exposure, which is the reconstruction cost. The Failing Role of Building Codes This overhead view of two adjacent properties shows how a fence can act like a wick leading wildfire ... [+] straight to a structure. While building codes are in place for a very good reason, the development of the codes and the management of the codes come with many challenges. Ian Giammanco serves as the managing director of standard and data analytics and lead research at the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety and explains that building codes can be adopted and enforced at a number of levels, with state-level building codes standing out as the only to be uniformly enforced. Local and county codes become a bit more haphazard in their enforcement. “We advocate for statewide code because it is uniformly enforced and it is easier for all,” he said. He provides a strong example. In Florida in 1992, there were many variants of building codes at state, county and city levels, causing conflicts and misunderstanding, so the enforcement was not as strong as it should have been. Those disparities had devastating consequences when the strongest hurricane in Florida’s history hit in 1992 when Hurricane Andrew hit, resulting in the most deaths and the highest dollar of destruction in history. “Codes are there for the communities of tomorrow, so they need to be in place before we build,” Giammanco said. “Every three years code gets updated. They need to be updated regularly so that the latest engineering and science is in there.” As hurricanes continue to batter homes in Florida, the building code improves and now it usually is ranked as first or second in terms of effectiveness nationwide. “Following Hurricane Ian in 2022, we looked at 3,600 homes, 455 of which were built under the modern Florida Building Code, and none had structural damage,” he said. “It shows that the work that is being done is valuable and powerful.” In other extreme events, like wildfires, building codes have a long way to go. “Wildfires hit from the outside in and building codes usually deal with fires that ignite inside a property,” he said. “Only two states, California and Utah, have a wildfire-centric code in place today that is effective to protect outside in.” With the age of today’s housing stock, retrofits and renovations will be critical to protect residents from future events. The building codes for these remodels is harder to manage and to inspire participation with because homeowners have to commit to the upfront costs. A good example of this is the FORTIFIED program that has three levels and roof replacement is one of them. When a homeowner elects to reroof their home, it provides a good opportunity to do something stronger or better. Giammanco has seen successful incentive programs that will cover the cost differential or a claim to cover the added cost to go to a FORTIFIED roof so that the homeowner isn’t responsible for the extra expense, but gets better protection. Insurance Impacts This home was built to the FORTIFIED standard, a voluntary beyond-code construction method that ... [+] strengthens areas of buildings typically vulnerable to high winds and heavy rain. The CoreLogic data consists of 110,000,000 single family residences and, unfortunately, there is no industry-wide accessibility to which properties have insurance that would lead to smarter, safer communities. “We actually could get at analytics if there was industry-wide information on name of the insurer and the coverage A amount on the actual policy,” Srinivasan said. “That would go a long way in identifying under insured gaps. With the vast amount of loans being government backed, it’s surprising there isn’t easily accessible data on it.” Having that knowledge would completely transform this space that is incredibly difficult to manage currently with such little transparency. One means to help today would be to develop more precision in how loss is predicted so that the insurance companies can make appropriate offerings. “The private insurance market is what people really need to get the options for the best price and we have to maintain that,” Giammanco said. “With the changing landscape because of climate, we have to make structures stronger. Insurers are going to look at new products – like parametric insurance that is already in commercial space and might move into residential where the event severity triggers the right coverage.” To help solve these equations, there is a need for better building envelope materials along with better test standards to improve those materials. Then, those materials have to be deployed in the market at a reasonable price to scale up. For instance, composite materials are good at preventing hail damage but are still too expensive. In the case of fire, it’s more complicated and relies on a system where insuring individual homes doesn’t solve for the challenge. “Why fire is so scary is that in suburban neighborhoods, the codes didn’t account for it,” he said. “The neighborhood issue is hard because if two homes are close together and one is perfect but has one weakness it can be exploited because the neighbor did no mitigation. For us to tackle fire we have to do it at large scale – neighborhood, community scale to drive it.” Alabama and Louisiana recently implemented a very successful retrofit grant campaign to bring homes up to code and prevent future damage. The states joke that their grants sell out faster than Taylor Swift concert tickets. After the 2005 hurricane season, Alabama acknowledged it had to do something to maintain a good private insurance space. Launching the Smart Home Alabama program to drive consumer demand to set a benchmark of the minimum that you could do to build to the FORTIFIED standard. Growth started to kick in as builders caught on and local jurisdictions got involved. The grants got more funding and individual insurance carried beyond. “Almost a quarter of all homes in those counties are now built to that standard,” he said. “More than 45,000 homes in those two counties have the designation of being FORTIFIED. It wasn’t just insurance, it was incentives. Grants are like pressing a button for awareness.” Developing New Defenses Across the pond, William Swan and his team at Energy House 2.0 have developed one of the world’s most sophisticated testing centers that help manufacturers and industry players understand climate impacts on a variety of scales. “We need to build a new product,” he said about today’s housing. “The product previously built has been built for many, many years and there are issues around financing, insurance, between builders and energy providers. The business models are changing, so all the underlying institutional frameworks have to adjust.” Snow covers the ground of a testing chamber at the University of Salford's Energy House 2.0 testing ... [+] center. At the Energy House there are testing chambers where the team can construct a whole building, giving a holistic picture of the inputs, while also reducing the length and the expense of field trials. Wind, snow and solar can be measured in the chamber showing impacts on temperature, and the relative humidity. “At the lab, you can compress the time to undertake research by controlling the weather and by doing repeated experiments,” Swan said. “There are more data to see why things worked, not just if they worked, which is difficult in the field. We also could change the house as needed, energy systems, boilers, different ways to control, EVs, renewables and how all these things interact and even down to what difference does carpet make to energy efficiency.” Swan says the testing is all about the future. For example, Energy House is working with the homebuilders Bellway and Barratt to test the product they will be offering in 2025. “The demands on the performance of those buildings is much higher,” he said. “They have been building the same thing for 50 years, but future home standards means that they cannot use gas and the standards for building are much higher, which may be difficult to scale using traditional building methods.” The future also means issues that aren’t prevalent today, like overheating and making homes very water efficient to deal with droughts. The new extremes with hurricane force winds are very difficult but can be tested in the chambers, along with flooding by building a concrete base around the house and filling it with water. “When the homes are built, we put sensors in the walls, and each home has nearly $50,000 of sensors so every circuit or element can be monitored,” he said. The sensors provide data that is then collected and analyzed. Then, Energy House distributes the new knowledge to the industry at large to inform regulatory standards groups and policy bodies. Providing the research and doing the science is in the lab’s expert hands but leaves a fundamental responsibility to the builders. “As much as we are doing the science, the builders need to tell a story that the consumers can understand and make as usable as possible,” Swan said. Innovation is gaining ground, with homes such as this cantilevered design that can survive floodplains – a great story for a home buyer. Here are three other housing innovations that stand up to the most aggressive hurricane forces. As the future data predicts, we need to be prepared – with smarter products, systems, and programs.

The United Nations and its partners estimate that 1.6 million people could be affected by flooding in the current deyr (October to December) rainy season, with 1.5 million hectares of farmland potentially being destroyed. Increased rainfall is forecast due to a concurrence of El Niño conditions and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole phenomenon. The Food and Agriculture Organization's Somali Water and Land Information Management projects a flood event of a magnitude statistically likely only once in 100 years, with significant anticipated humanitarian impacts. While all possible preparatory measures are being pursued, a flood of this magnitude can only be mitigated and not prevented. Early warning and early action can save lives and livelihoods, but large-scale displacement, increased humanitarian needs and further destruction of property remain likely. The newly-released funds - $10 million from the Central Emergency Fund (CERF) and $15 million from the Somalia Humanitarian Fund - will support efforts to prevent loss of life, stem disease outbreaks and address food insecurity. Somalia, which has been emerging from a historic drought, is one of many countries facing a heightened risk of flooding, drought, and extreme heat in the coming months spurred by the El Niño and the positive Indian Ocean Dipole. ""Extreme weather linked to the ongoing El Niño risks further driving up humanitarian needs in already-vulnerable communities in Somalia and many other places,"" said Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. ""We know what the risks are, and we need to get ahead of these looming crises."" The CERF funds will help UN agencies and partners assist more than 280,000 people during the initial phase of the crisis, while the Somalia Humanitarian Fund resources will support more than 420,000 people. The humanitarian system now regularly incorporates extreme weather warnings, including seasonal forecasting, to inform anticipatory and early action to get ahead of crises. CERF is using a proactive approach to address the potential consequences of the current El Niño globally.

The Dnipro… [+4318 chars]",Weather,"A sweeping plain dotted with ruined houses stretched into the horizon and towards the blue expanse of the Dnipro river, where a clutch of Ukrainian forces were poised for Russian attacks. The Dnipro, Europe's fourth-longest river and a historic trading route, has become a key front since Ukrainian troops pushed Russian forces back over its banks in the south last year. The river winds the length of the country from north to south, eventually flowing into the Black Sea from the Kherson region, where it separates the two armies. While Ukraine's recapture of Kherson city last November was a shock defeat for the Kremlin, Russian forces on the opposing bank still control swathes of territory and shell towns and villages they retreated from. ""The Russians are throwing everything they have at us: artillery, attack drones, phosphorus,"" an army sergeant with the call sign Vozhd, or Leader, told AFP. His unit was keeping watch on the riverbank southwest of Kherson city, ready to alert artillery units if Russian forces made an incursion across the river. Wearing a balaclava and carrying a gun, the 38-year-old serviceman said the good weather the region had been enjoying was playing in their favour. ""Rain is the enemy. When the sky is clear, you can see boats arriving much better,"" he said. Kyiv launched a major counteroffensive in the south and east in June but the front line has barely moved and the two sides have continually bombarded each other with heavy weaponry. ""We have the advantage on this side,"" Vozhd said, standing on a small promontory topped with tufts of dry grass. This position is higher than the opposite bank sheltering the Russian lines, around 10 kilometres (six miles) across the water. This autumn, Ukrainian forces appeared to have established several small bridgeheads on the left bank northeast of the city of Kherson. Vozhd's 45-year-old commander, whose call sign is Armyanchik, said his men also sometimes cross to the Dnipro's left bank. ""The Russians are well prepared. They have solid lines of defence. It won't be easy but on the other hand, this is our homeland and we know the terrain,"" Armyanchik told AFP, conceding his forces lacked armoured boats. Karamba, a moustachioed 35-year-old, participated in operations on the opposite bank. His work was to clear mines before assault brigades arrive, a task made more difficult by the breach of the dam in June, which sent a torrent of floodwater downstream and dislodged landmines. ""Because of the flooding, there are mines everywhere: inside ruined houses, in thickets and caught in dead branches,"" he said. At another position near the Dnipro, a unit of the 123rd territorial brigade was using a large abandoned building as a mortar position and to hide boats. ""We have to be discreet here,"" said one soldier, referring to pro-Russian informers among the local population. Nearby a 31-year-old gunner with the call sign Vitamin was tasked with firing mortar rounds at coordinates provided by scouts like Vozhd. ""The Russians have had faster boats for two months now,"" he said, making adjustments to his mortar. His main target was a network of small islands scattered across the river, where he said the Russians were ""trying to set up positions"". ""I'm here to stop them,"" said the gunner, who claimed to have sunk six Russian boats with their crews. He said he did not know the number of Ukrainian boats sunk in turn. ""The river is a natural rampart. It makes it more difficult for the enemy to position itself, but also for us to land on the other side,"" he said. Between his legs, a small dog called Zhulka barks. The Ukrainian soldiers rescued her from one of the islands during an operation. She has since become a kind of ""alarm signal"": she always runs away from approaching drones -- a serious hazard on the plains. ""Drones are always flying over our heads, our mortars and tanks. They constantly fire down at you -- and that's on top of the aviation,"" Karamba said. ""The Russians have more drones than us,"" Vitamin added. ""I'm sure they are watching us right now.""","['ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'not found', 'not found']",us,False,False

""Schools [are] being affected ... and even hospital facilities in some of the places that have been marooned are also affected,"" Murgor told VOA. The situation could get worse, Murgor said. In its forecast for this year's last quarter, the Kenya Meteorological Department had warned the country will experience above-average rainfall, driven by warmer sea surface temperatures over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. ""We are informed by the [weather forecaster] that November normally is the peak,"" Murgor told VOA. ""If November is the peak and we are just at the beginning of November, chances are ... the situation is likely to worsen in the month towards the end, probably seeing a bit more people being displaced, probably seeing a bit more loss of livelihoods."" Nearly half of the 47 counties in Kenya are at risk, he said, with the northeastern part of the country being the most affected. Heavy rains also have affected neighboring Uganda, Ethiopia and Somalia, where the government declared a state of emergency after 29 people died and hundreds of thousands were displaced as a result of the extreme weather. Meanwhile, in Kenya, Murgor said flash floods would likely cause more problems. ""We are likely to see a rise in disease outbreak as a secondary impact of the flooding,"" he said. ""But from the Kenya Red Cross prospect, we are working together with the ministry of health, with the government, with stakeholders, trying to see how to mitigate against the effect, how to anticipate and then try to act early [and] work with farmers to do post-harvest loss management."" He also said that in cases in which early warnings are possible, communities would be alerted about possible floods so people can move to safer ground.

She is an expert in innovation and leveraging co-creation and challenge-based learning. In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, the end of the year brings a flood of predictions and prognostications about the top tech trends that will shape the coming year. As innovation leaders, you're no stranger to these lists; they often pepper your news feeds and social media timelines. Yet, while these trends provide a glimpse into what's on the horizon, they often fall short of offering actionable insights for leaders like you. It's time to go beyond the buzzwords and dissect how these technologies can genuinely impact your workflows, product roadmaps and, most importantly, your customers' experiences. Prioritizing The Right Trends When faced with an array of trending technologies, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. However, the key is not to adopt every tech trend that comes your way, but to identify those that align with your organization's goals and customer needs. AI And Generative AI: Artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI (GenAI) promise to revolutionize various industries. AI and machine learning have been on many companies’ roadmaps for years. However, the availability of free GenAI tools to the masses has brought it into increased focus. Consider how AI might be integrated into your product's core functionalities, how it might become part of your workflow and how it may change the core skills you are recruiting for. Quantum Computing: Quantum computing may still seem like science fiction, but its potential is real. Start by exploring how quantum computing could transform your industry or processes. Collaborate with experts in the field and begin thinking about its implications on encryption, cybersecurity and data processing. 5G And IoT: 5G and IoT offer unprecedented connectivity and real-time data processing capabilities. IoT solutions that leverage the low latency and high bandwidth of 5G could be game changers. Think about how this can create more immersive and responsive customer experiences, from smart homes to connected factories. The Metaverse, AR And VR: The metaverse, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) continue to present exciting opportunities to enhance user experiences. Think about how you can create immersive, interactive experiences for your customers. Consider applications in gaming, employee training, virtual conferences and more. Blockchain: Blockchain goes beyond cryptocurrencies. Investigate its applications in supply chain tracking, digital identity verification and more. From Trends To Impact: Customer-Centric Strategies Once you've identified the trends that most align with your goals, it's crucial to shift your focus from what these technologies can do to how they can drive impact on your customers' experiences. After all, innovation should enhance user experiences and address their pain points. The great news is that you already have access to the experts who know exactly how these trends can drive growth: your colleagues and customers. Engage your customers in the exploration of how trends will impact their experiences and thereby de-risk new product or service development investments. Engage your colleagues to identify how new tech may assist and accelerate their workflows. Customer-Centric Product Roadmaps: Ensure that your product roadmaps prioritize features and functionalities that directly benefit your customers. Conduct surveys, gather feedback and involve them in the ideation process to understand their evolving needs. Design Thinking Workshops: Host design thinking workshops within your organization. Encourage cross-functional collaboration to generate ideas that prioritize user experiences. These sessions can lead to breakthrough innovations. Hackathons And Innovation Challenges: Organize hackathons or innovation challenges to foster creativity and identify talent within your organization. These events can result in rapid prototyping and the exploration of novel solutions. User-Centric Metrics: Shift your KPIs and metrics to focus on customer-centric outcomes. metrics like Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) can help you gauge the real impact of your innovations. Upskilling For Success To capitalize on the upcoming trends, you must ensure that your teams have the necessary skills and knowledge. The tech landscape is continuously evolving, so ongoing upskilling is essential. Continuous Learning Culture: Promote a culture of continuous learning within your organization. Encourage employees to explore new technologies and methodologies relevant to their roles and ensure there are pathways for this exploration that abide by security and IT policies and practices. Training And Development: Invest in training and development programs for your teams and ensure they align with the needs of your company not just now, but in the years to come. Consider alternative training methodologies such as hackathons, bootcamps and challenges that can pay dividends both as training opportunities as well as exploring how new technologies can drive your company to success. Skill Diversification: Encourage your employees to diversify their skill sets. Cross-functional teams with diverse expertise can tackle complex challenges more effectively. While the deluge of tech trends can be overwhelming, innovation leaders have a unique opportunity to steer their organizations toward success in 2024 and beyond. By carefully prioritizing the right trends, adopting a customer-centric mindset and upskilling your teams, you can chart a course toward innovation that truly impacts your workflows, product roadmaps and, most importantly, your customers' experiences. In a rapidly evolving tech landscape, the power to innovate and adapt remains your greatest asset.

New York 9 November 2023 The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General. **Noon Briefing Guests Ok, good afternoon. In a short while, we will be joined by Rola Dashti, the Executive Secretary of the UN Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA), which is based in Beirut, and we will also be joined by Abdallah Al Dardari, the Assistant Secretary-General and Director of the Regional Bureau for Arab States — for the UN Development Programme (UNDP). They will be here to brief you on the launch of a new report on the expected socio-economic impact on Palestine of the ongoing conflict. **Paris Conference Earlier today, the Secretary-Generaladdressedthe International Humanitarian Conference for the Civilian Population in Gaza, that is been hosted in Paris by President [Emmanuel] Macron. The Secretary-General addressed it by video message. He told the delegates that we must step up to assist and protect civilians in Gaza. That, Mr. Guterres said, means an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, ensuring full respect for international humanitarian law. It also means unfettered, safe and sustained access to bring in and distribute supplies at much greater scale, volume and frequency — and that includes fuel. It means investing in the $1.2 billion humanitarian appeal that the UN has just launched to help the civilians in Gaza. Martin Griffiths, for his part, the Emergency Relief Coordinator, was physically in Paris, as well as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) Commissioner General, Philippe Lazzarini, they both attended the conference in person. Their remarks reiterated the Secretary-General's calls. Mr. Lazzarini also reminded participants that 700,000 people are now living in 150 UNRWA schools and buildings across the Gaza Strip. He said that UNRWA shelters are overcrowded, with little food, water or privacy, adding that the appalling sanitary conditions represent a looming public health hazard. He thanked the countries that announced the new contributions in the past weeks, but added that UNRWA's core budget remains underfunded, and the biggest UN Agency in Gaza might not have the funds for staff salaries until the end of the year, he added. For his part, Martin Griffiths said civilians must be protected, and their essential needs met, wherever they are in Gaza. The UN, he added, cannot be part of a unilateral proposal to push hundreds of thousands of desperate civilians into so-called safe zones. He said the UN has not been involved in preparing for the arrival of displaced people in any prospective ""safe zone"" in Gaza. On behalf of the humanitarian community, he expressed concerns — first, about the safety of civilians in so-called safe zones if there is no agreement between all the parties to their establishment. He also said he is concerned that satisfactory conditions do not exist anywhere in Gaza to ensure adequate shelter, food, water, sanitation and health. The remarks of these three people were shared with you earlier. **Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory And just a bit of an update about what's going on the ground, with further details. Our humanitarian colleagues say that, amid intense hostilities, people in the north of Gaza continue to flee to the south, mostly on foot, facing thirst and exhaustion along the way. Yesterday, about 50,000 people evacuated the north of Gaza. Clashes and shelling on and around the road reportedly continued, endangering evacuees as they moved South, with reports of corpses being seen on the road. Hundreds of thousands of people who still remain in the north of Gaza are facing a dire humanitarian situation, struggling to secure the minimum amounts of water and food to survive. Our humanitarian colleagues are telling us that, yesterday, a total of 106 trucks, primarily carrying food, medicine, health supplies, bottled water and hygiene products, crossed from Egypt into Gaza through the Rafah crossing, the total number since 21 October according to our math is 756. This of course represents only a fraction of what is needed and still no fuel going in. Also, to speak about the lack of fuel and its consequences, Al Quds hospital in Gaza City had to shut down key services yesterday. Al Awda hospital, the only provider of maternity services in north Gaza warned about imminent closure. As we mentioned yesterday, the World Health Organization and UNRWA on Tuesday managed to deliver much needed medical supplies and medicine to Al Shifa hospital in Gaza city. That was only the second delivery of lifesaving supplies to this hospital since the beginning of the conflict. The first delivery was on 24 October. Our WHO colleagues say that while welcome, the quantities delivered are far from sufficient to meet with the immediate needs. **United Nations Flag And just to let you know that on Monday, 13 November, the UN Flag will be lowered at half-mast to pay tribute to our UNRWA colleagues who have lost their lives in Gaza. We are also asking UN offices around the world to do so on the same day and observe a minute of silence on Monday. For those of you who are interested, we are making provisions for visual coverage, the flag will be lowered at 7:30 a.m. on Monday morning, please be in touch with our MALU colleagues if you want to send a camera person or a photographer or just want to watch. **Ukraine Turning to Ukraine, in a statement issued by our Humanitarian Coordinator, Denise Brown, today she said that she is outraged to learn of an attack yesterday on a civilian vessel that was entering the Ukrainian Black Sea Port of Pivdennyi, killing a port worker and injuring crew members of the vessel. She shared her condolences with the family of the killed port pilot and hoped for the recovery of the injured. Ms. Brown noted that this happens just a few days after a series of attacks that killed and injured civilians, destroyed grain supplies and damaged a 124-year-old Fine Arts Museum in Odesa. She pointed out that yesterday's attack is one of over 30 attacks on Ukrainian port facilities since the termination of the Black Sea Initiative in July. This tragic incident marks the first-time civilians are killed or injured on a civilian vessel. And she stressed that international humanitarian law strictly prohibits attacks on civilian infrastructure. **South Sudan Turning to South Sudan, our humanitarian colleagues say they are sounding the alarm over the surge in returnees and refugees fleeing the conflict to the north, in Sudan. The number of people arriving to South Sudan increased in October by at least 50 per cent compared to September. As of yesterday, that would be 8 November, more than 366,000 men, women and children had been recorded crossing the border from Sudan since the conflict began. As that conflict edges further south, it could trigger more displacement, putting additional pressure on an already over-stretched response. The humanitarian community continues to provide life-saving assistance where resources allow — however, some partners are expecting to run out of funds before the end of the year, with the Emergency Response Plan for returnees and refugees in South Sudan reported at just 14 per cent funded. It is critical that donors step up their support so that we and our partners can provide food and nutrition assistance, adequate sanitation and hygiene facilities, as well as onward transportation services. **Somalia And in Somalia, we have released $25 million to cope with the effects of once-in-a-century flooding. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and its partners estimate that some 1.6 million people could be impacted by floods during the current ""deyr"" rainy season — made even more intense by a concurrence of El Niño conditions and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole phenomenon. Several areas in the Middle Juba region have received far more rain in just the past week than in the entire seasonal average. The newly released funds include $10 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund and $15 million from the Somalia Humanitarian Fund. They will support our work to save lives, stem disease outbreaks and deal with food insecurity. **El Niño And speaking of El Niño, today, the Food and Agriculture Organization released an updated Anticipatory Action and Response Plan to support 4.8 million people in countries that are expected to feel the impacts of El Niño. The $160 million plan will help people in countries across Eastern and Southern Africa, Asia and the Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean through March next year. As the world enters this El Niño cycle with a record 258 million people experiencing acute hunger in 2022 and only 20 per cent of the total funds required to cope with high levels of acute food insecurity. Many countries facing humanitarian crises also risk being affected by El Niño impacts in the coming weeks and months. More details on the interweb. **Week of Science and Peace Today, the International Week of Science and Peace, who knew? The Week encourages greater academic exchanges on a subject of universal importance while also generating greater awareness of the relationship of science and peace among the general public, that includes you. **Guests Tomorrow Tomorrow, we will have guests from Sudan and Nigeria, we will have Clementine Nkweta-Salami, the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, and we will have Matthias Schmale, the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator ad interim for Nigeria. They will both brief you on the humanitarian situation in the respective countries, so that we don't lose sight of other crisis around the world. Edith, then Amelie, then Dezhi. Questions and Answers Question: Thank you, Steph. Does the Secretary-General have any comment on the White House announcement that Israel has agreed to four hour daily pauses to allow humanitarian goods to get in and perhaps spur the release of the hostages? Spokesman: We've just seen the press reports not long ago. How any such halt in the fighting and how it would work for humanitarian purposes would need to be coordinated with the United Nations, especially on the issue of timings and location. And obviously, in order for this to be done safely for humanitarian purposes, it would have to be agreed with all parties to the conflict to be truly effective. Question: A question on a completely different subject. There's been some rather intense fighting in Shan State in Myanmar, and this made me wonder is the Secretary-General going to appoint a new Special Envoy for Myanmar? Spokesman: Yes. Question: When? Spokesman: As soon as we have an announcement. I don't mean to make light of it. That process is ongoing. Correspondent: Because it has been quite a long time. Spokesman: Indeed it has. Okay. Amelie, then Dezhi. Question: A follow-up on that. If I understand correctly, what the White House said is that the White House said, sorry, is that the main purpose of the pause would be for the civilian to flee. Do you think, I mean, how far can you say that most of them are fleeing by foot? So how far can they go in four hours? And, I mean, how do you think it could help in any way the civilian to flee the north? Spokesman: Again, we saw this like you did, right, on press reports. Well, I'm just talking to you about kind of the principles on our end, right? How if these things are to be effective for humanitarian purposes, they need to be coordinated with us as we are the deliverers of humanitarian assistance, especially on timing and location. And it's, of course, critical that all the parties to this conflict also agree with them. But we're obviously trying to seek out more information. Dezhi? But in the view of the United Nations, you don't think this is a humanitarian pause? Spokesman: I mean, I... Question: Or not? Spokesman: You have to ask those who made the announcement how they labelled it. Correspondent: No, no, no. Spokesman: I gave you our initial reaction to what was announced. If we get more information, we'll have most likely further reaction. But it was announced in a certain way, certain terminology was used. Everybody's being very careful in the words that they use. But that is our response. Question: Do you think humanitarianly speaking, is that in the right direction? Spokesman: My answer to you was humanitarianly speaking. I kind of laid out what we would want to see. Question: Okay. My second question, lately, I think many parties they are discussing... they were discussing about the future after the so-called Gaza war. How would the UN participate in the, how to say, post conflict reconstruction or administration? Spokesman: Well, I think the SG has addressed this publicly. I think, obviously, they would have to be some sort of a transitory period. I mean, what he said, the best case scenario as far as Secretary-General's concern is that after the end of military operations, you know, a reinvigorated and strengthened Palestinian Authority would assume political control in Gaza. We could play a role as well in supporting other countries, you know, other entities would obviously have a role to play. The US would have a role to play. But all of that would need to be discussed with the Israelis and the Palestinians. Question: But then would the UN support the security force of the Israel being there for a period of time? Spokesman: As I said, there would obviously have to be transition period. I think the Secretary-General laid out what his long-term vision would be. Question: And one last question. How's the $1.2 billion appeal going? Spokesman: It was just launched. We'll try to get some updates from OCHA. But just as a reminder, all of our humanitarian appeals are posted on the OCHA website, and you can look minute by minute, and you can see how quickly your own donation will be registered, Dezhi. Anade? Question: I have a question on Haiti. Earlier today, the Kenyan Interior Minister said that the Kenyan mission is... that the mission to Haiti and the international force is not a Kenyan mission. It's a United Nations mission that Kenya was asked to coordinate. He then went on to say that the mission will not be deployed before all the resources are mobilized and available. And as you may know, estimates say that the force needs about 255 million euros for deployment. And so my question is, given the sense of urgency described by both the UN and the Secretary-General when it comes to the situation in Haiti, what is your reaction to today's developments? Spokesman: Well, it is what the Security Council approved, which is the UN Security Council approved the dispatch of a multinational force or mission. So in a sense, it is under the umbrella of a UN resolution, but it is not a UN peacekeeping or UN police force with blue helmet. So we are not in the business of putting that force together. It is important that the international community, those countries that have the capacity and the will to do it support the Kenyan efforts because they are... and I'm not here to support or contradict the Foreign Minister, but he's correct in that sense. It is also vital that those countries that have the financial capacity support those countries that are going to put physical boots on the ground. And the situation is not getting better, right? And every Member State has a role to play in supporting the efforts of those who are willing to send men and women to help the people of Haiti. Question: A follow-up. What can the UN do to speed up the collection of these resources such that the force can be deployed as soon as possible? Spokesman: Well, we're continuing our advocacy. We in terms of the Secretary-General, the Secretariat don't have, it's not as if we have money to put into those efforts. We are obviously always there to help as a resource or guidance for those countries who will be putting boots on the ground. Tony, and then yeah. Question: Thank you, Steph. Earlier today, Mr. Griffiths in Paris mentioned that the UN has not been involved in preparing for the arrival of displaced people in any prospective safe zone in Gaza. So... but you do have staff in northern... in the south, I mean, south of Gaza. Is that correct? Spokesman: That's correct. Question: So what's their role right now? How are they coping with the displacement of this huge number of people? Spokesman: I mean, they are doing whatever they can with the little resources that we have in order to ensure that people are staying alive. I mean, we're running out of, you know, there was not enough food, there's not enough water, not to mention the fuel. What Mr. Griffiths was referring to, and I think it's worth reading exactly what he said very carefully, is this whole discussion about setting up ""safe zones"" and our concerns about what that means. And what needs to be done in order for any safe zone to be truly safe. And I think he laid it out with great clarity. Question: A follow-up has not been involved, which means is the UN still part of this discussion today? Spokesman: We are still very much part of the discussions on the humanitarian situation. Griffiths is saying is that we're not advocating for these safe zones as they're being laid out. Yes, please. Question: Thank you, Stephane. I just wanted to get some clarification. You mentioned earlier that there's currently one hospital in Gaza that provides maternal services, correct? Spokesman: If I said it, I hope it's true. And let me check what exactly... yes, in northern Gaza. Correspondent: In northern Gaza. Spokesman: Thank you somebody for paying attention. Al Awda Hospital is the only provider of maternity services in northern Gaza. Question: Northern Gaza? Spokesman: Yeah. Question: Did you mention the name? Sorry, I hope you mentioned the name. Spokesman: Al Awda Hospital. Question: Sorry? Correspondent: Al Awda. Thank you. Spokesman: No problem. Dennis, then Dawn, and then... Question: Tomorrow is going to be a Paris Peace Forum. Will Secretary-General or UN on the whole participate in this event? Spokesman: The Secretary-General will not be at the Paris Peace Forum. I have to check what our participation is. I know we will have people there. I need to double-check for you. Correspondent: Okay. Spokesman: Okay. Dawn? Question: Steph, I have a follow-up and then a question. Just so I'm clear, are you... nobody really knows what these safe zones are? It just sounds... Spokesman: Is that a question or a statement? Question: It's a question. Nobody really knows what these safe zones are. I think it was Antony Blinken that first mentioned this a couple of weeks ago or a week ago about creating safe zones. Spokesman: Right. Question: So are you saying that the UN doesn't know what these safe zones are? Spokesman: Well, I think there's a lot of discussion going on about safe zones. What we're saying for a zone to be safe for us, it cannot be a unilateral decision by one party to a conflict for it to be a safe zone. I mean, I'm talking here, obviously, what's going on in Gaza, but in general principles. You know, if a safe zone in a conflict is going to be established, it is clear that all of the parties who are involved in the fighting have to agree that the zone is safe. Because otherwise, you're putting not only the civilians at risk, but you're also putting the humanitarians at risk. I wanted to ask you a question. The other day at the White House, John Kirby was asked about the Secretary-General's comment referring to Gaza as a graveyard for children. And in his response, I'm just a little confused, and I'm trying to understand whether or not the Secretary-General sees it this way. He seemed to pivot towards Hamas in saying that the reason that there's so many deaths, I mean, not directly, but Hamas is making it worse because they're putting those children and their families in greater danger and I'm quoting him here, by not letting them go, by encouraging them to stay. And I'm wondering if that... is that how the Secretary-General understands it that it's Hamas that's preventing children from leaving? Spokesman: The Secretary-General sees it as a place where we've had more than 10,000 civilians dead. We know that a large part of that number are children, and they are dead because there is a conflict going on. So, I think he was very clear and used simple words in his statement, and it's based on fact. Yes, sir. Question: Oh, thank you. The US bases in Iraq and Syria have been attacked more than 40 times since mid-October, and the attacks have been claimed by Iran- backed group. After that, the US carried out a strike against weapons storage facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran's backed group. Any comments on that? And also do you think this is... the war is spreading because Antony Blinken said Iran used that as an excuse to attack the US bases. Spokesman: I think we're very concerned about these developments that we've seen not only in Syria, but in Iraq. They are an indication of the risk of further spreading of the conflict that we have seen. And it is incumbent on everyone to respect the territorial integrity of Syria and Iraq and to engage in maximum possible restraint. So it's not to increase the risk of spreading. Stefano, and then we'll go to the screen. It's a long time I don't ask you about Mario Paciolla, but there is a news just came from Rome today. A Rome court rejected the request to close the investigation to the death of the Italian aid worker. Paciolla founded that in Colombia in 2020, where he worked for the United Nations. The judges ordered an extension of the investigation. Do you have any comment? Spokesman: No. I hadn't seen that report. Just email it to me and we'll try to get you some answers. Let's go to the screen. We'll go to Joe, and then Caitlin. Joe, you're muted. Alright. I will try to come back to you. Let's go to Caitlin. Question: Thanks, Stephane. Two questions. First, do you have a view on what a minimum pause would be for humanitarian work to be effective? I believe that IRC has said it needs five days. It seems it would be useful at a minimum for the UN to define what it needs. Spokesman: We continue to advocate for a ceasefire. We're not in the business right now of haggling in terms of time. We want to have sufficient space and most importantly sufficient safety guarantees from all that humanitarian aid can be dispersed safely. Your second question. Question: Any details on the UN's role in the freeing of Luis Diaz's father in Colombia? We saw footage that seemed to show UN workers wearing UN vests, maybe a UN helicopter. What can we know about that? In fact, the UN political mission in Colombia worked closely with the Catholic Church, with the government, and with the ELN to release the father of Luis Diaz, the footballer. We, along with the church, were in charge of the actual operation. So we used our helicopters, our planes. Luis's father was taken to one of the UN's regional offices in Valledupar, in the Northeast part of Colombia where he was reunited with his family. The head of the UN's political mission, Carlos Ruiz Massieu was there. And they were there with the family. We spoke to them a few minutes ago. They reported that Luis Diaz' father was, thank God, in good physical health. And the fact that this operation was conducted successfully is an example of the trust that currently exists between all the parties, the ELN delegation, the government, the UN, as well as the Catholic Church in Colombia. And that's it. Question: Sorry. Can I just follow-up. Question: So was the UN involved in the negotiations? Spokesman: I'm not going to go into the discussions, but I can tell you that we were involved in his handing over from the ELN into his freedom. Question: Stephane, can you hear me now? Spokesman: Yes, sir. I can. I figured it out. Does the Secretary-General still believe that Hamas would be a credible partner in a workable ceasefire when one of its officials was just quoted in interview with the New York Times as saying, ""I hope that the state of war with Israel will become permanent on all the borders"". And another senior official said, ""Hamas' goal is not to run Gaza and to bring it water and electricity and such."" What is the Secretary-General's reaction to such inflammatory comments? Spokesman: I think the Secretary-General, if you look back at all the comments he has made has been very clear in condemning the acts of terror that were committed by Hamas. Some of the way that Hamas has been conducting its operations, also inside Gaza, I will refer you to what he said previously. It is just a basic point, I think, which doesn't imply a qualitative judgment, but it is if you're going to work towards a ceasefire, you can only work with those parties who are involved in the firing. Your next question, Joe? Correspondent: But both parties have to, in good faith, not only agree to it on paper, but implement it. And you have one side saying they believe in perpetual war, and they don't care about improving the lives in Gaza. Spokesman: I can't predict the future, I think our position is clear, at least it is to me. Let's continue to the screen Serife. Serife you had a question. Question: Yes. I do. Thank you, Stephane. If I may, I just want to go back to the White House announcement. They are talking about a humanitarian pause in Northern Gaza and yesterday, when asked about where a possible ceasefire in Gaza will apply to, I recall you said that the integrity of Gaza must be preserved. So in light of this announcement, do you have something to say? Spokesman: Well, I mean, I have nothing to add to what I said yesterday or today. Question: But then you do... do you repeat that? That the integrative Gaza must be maintained. Spokesman: My opinion doesn't change from one day to the next. Question: Great. And... Spokesman: Go ahead. Question: The latest number on the number of on UNRWA personnel killed it was...? Spokesman: It is 99. Correspondent: Thank you. Thank you so much. Ibtisam, then Abdelhamid, and then I think we'll go to the guests. Ibtisam, Abdelhamid? Alright, going once, twice. Question: Here. I am here. Can you hear me? Spokesman: Oh, you're here. Go ahead. And then we'll go to our guests who've been very patient. Question: Yes, I have two questions. Faster questions. The Secretary-General yesterday said to Reuters, he was talking to Reuters, and he said, he believed with the number of civilians killed that Israel made a mistake... Spokesman: I think you were cut off Abdelhamid, and other people will be my witness. Correspondent: Yes. Question: You heard me? I did not hear you. Question: Did you hear my question? Spokesman: You were cut off. Yeah. If you could just repeat it quickly, because our guests are waiting. Question: Yeah, quickly, the Secretary-General yesterday told Reuters that he believed that Israel made a mistake with the number of civilians killed. So Israel made a mistake. What does he mean by that? Spokesman: I don't think that's the exact quote, and I would encourage you to look at the whole video. And I think if you look at the whole thing, I think what he said would be very clear. Correspondent: My... Stephane... Spokesman: Abdelhamid, I'm not hearing you. Correspondent: Heritage... I apologize, but I will go get our guests.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'lebanon', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'egypt', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'southsudan', 'southsudan', 'southsudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'nigeria', 'nigeria', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'haiti', 'haiti', 'haiti', 'haiti', 'kenya', 'iraq', 'iraq', 'iraq', 'syria', 'syria', 'syria', 'syria', 'iran', 'iran', 'italy', 'italy', 'colombia', 'colombia', 'colombia', 'colombia', 'colombia', 'colombia', 'algeria', 'algeria']",us,True,False

Kevin McCauley said he awoke to water flooding into his home on the Omeath Road alongside Newry Canal. While support for businesses has been forthcoming, a number of homes were also severely damaged. Emergency rates relief for businesses will be automatically paid to those badly affected by the floods. In the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council area it is estimated 67 homes were flooded. Newry, Mourne and Down District Council said to date 107 residential properties have been issued with a payment of £1,000 from the Scheme for Emergency Financial Assistance (SEFA) payment scheme. The Department for Communities activated SEFA for the period from 17 October 2023 to 16 November 2023 whereby householders who suffered severe inconvenience could claim the payment from their local council. Mr McCauley told BBC News NI that when last week's flooding occurred his home was deluged and a week later he is still trying to save what he can. He doesn't know what will be done to prevent future flooding and said the sight of water coming into his home was terrifying. ""The bills are just coming and coming and coming to a house we cant live in. Unless someone fixes the bigger problem I'm in dire straits."" Mr McCauley recounted the minute his home started to flood, ""There's four or five inches of floodwater inside and 2.5ft outside - if this keeps coming in we are in trouble as we are in a bungalow. ""The water was nearly up to my waist - it's freezing."" Mr McCauley said he managed to get his children to safety but the risks played on his mind, ""I bring my middle daughter out to the van, I run back for my five year old, I think this is risky - I'm afraid of dropping him because it's so dark I cant see one thing."" The McCauley family have moved out of their home, but they do not know what to do next. ""I'm on my third skip at this stage. We are still trying to save some things, "" he added. ""We are living in a mobile home. Where do we go? What do we do?"" Meanwhile, businesses affected by the floods will receive rates relief. Some businesses will not have to apply for the funding as those eligible will be identified by the council. Measures will include 100% relief for non-domestic rates on flooded properties and support to help with temporary relocation. Ratepayers that have paid their rates in full this year will receive a refund. Public sector properties are excluded. Businesses must meet the following criteria to be eligible: If a business has relocated temporarily, it will be eligible for 100% rate relief up to 31 March 2024. This relief is only available when the business relocates to a property that was recorded as vacant on the rating system on the date of the flooding incident. The UK government pledged £15m to help flood-hit firms in Northern Ireland to cover the clean-up and resume trading. But some have criticised the amount on offer, with one trade body saying that about £37m is needed for Newry alone. Stormont's Department of Finance has said that more support will be available although it is not clear how much will be on offer or when it will be available.","['uk', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom']",gb,True,True

(http://pyrogenesis.com) (TSX: PYR) (NASDAQ: PYR) (FRA: 8PY), a high-tech company (the “Company” or “PyroGenesis”), that designs, develops, manufactures and commercializes advanced plasma processes and sustainable solutions which are geared to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG), is pleased to announce today its financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30th, 2023. ""We are seeing improvements across industrial supply chains and customer bottlenecks, resulting in two straight quarters of growth coming off of the three-year quarterly low we saw in Q1 of this year,"" said Mr. P. Peter Pascali, CEO and President of PyroGenesis. “While we can’t guarantee that these early signs of sector-wide recovery will continue at the same pace, our quarterly revenues are steadily increasing from the early year low. Combined with renewed strong demand in traditionally slower business lines such as waste destruction where we have signed contracts for six separate projects so far this year, and the increasing interest in plasma torch applications of 2MW power and higher, we have confidence around continued momentum.” “PyroGenesis is competing hard while closely scrutinizing both potential and existing projects to ensure that the utilization of our labour and financial resources are optimized. As we have shown in the past, we will only engage in projects if the short or long-term potential benefit to PyroGenesis is significant and well-understood. We continue to intensify our focus on project and budgetary clarity during this persistent period of elevated global inflationary pressures. As always, we maintain our emphasis on developing low carbon-footprint technology solutions that we believe will take hold with leading global industrial companies during a period of major paradigm shift, namely in Energy Transition & Emissions Reduction, Commodity Security & Optimization, and Waste Remediation,” added Mr. Pascali. PyroGenesis Canada Inc reports in Canadian dollar and in accordance with IFRSKey Q3 Financial Highlights Outlook and Recent Developments Q3 Production Highlights The information below represents highlights from the past quarter for each of the company’s main business verticals, followed by an outline of the Company’s strategy, and key developments that will impact the subsequent quarters. In Q3 2023, PyroGenesis continued its focus on advancing its updated business strategy that was first outlined in the Company’s 2022 fourth quarter and year-end results. As noted, as the variety of uses for the Company’s core technologies has expanded, and industry interest has increased, the Company is concentrating its activities under three ecosystem-solution that align with economic drivers that are key to global heavy industry: 1.Energy Transition & Emission Reduction: 2.Commodity Security & Optimization: 3.Waste Remediation: Within each vertical the Company offers several solutions at different stages of commercialization. 1.Energy Transition & Emission Reduction 2.Commodity Security & Optimization 3.Waste Remediation Q3 Financial Highlights Overall Strategy PyroGenesis provides technology solutions to heavy industry that leverage off of the Company’s expertise in ultra-high temperature processes. The Company has evolved from its early beginnings of being a specialty-engineering firm to being a provider of a robust technology eco-system for heavy industry that helps address key strategic goals. The Company believes its strategy to be quite timely, as multiple heavy industries are committing to major carbon and waste reduction programs at the same time as many governments are increasingly funding environmental technologies and infrastructure projects – all the while both are making it a strategy to ensure the availability of critical minerals during the coming decades of increased output demand. While there can be no guarantees, the Company believes the evolution of its strategy beyond greenhouse gas emission reduction, to an expanded focus that encapsulates the key verticals listed in the section “Q3 Production Highlights”, both (i) improves the Company’s chances for success while (ii) also providing a clearer picture of how the Company’s wide array of offerings work in tandem to support heavy industry goals. PyroGenesis’ market opportunity is significant, as major industries such as aluminum, steelmaking, manufacturing, defense, aeronautics, and government require factory-ready, technology-based solutions to help steer through the paradoxical landscape of increasing demand and tightening regulations and material availability. As more of the Company’s offerings reach full commercialization, PyroGenesis will remain focused on attracting influential customers in broad markets while at the same time ensuring that operating expenses are controlled to achieve profitable growth. For the remainder of 2023, we will continue to sharpen our focus on our strategy that structures our solution ecosystem under the three verticals noted previously: (i) energy transition & emission reduction, (ii) commodity security & optimization, and (iii) waste remediation. Cost Controls and Efficiencies PyroGenesis is competing hard while closely scrutinizing both potential and existing projects to ensure that the utilization of our labour and financial resources are optimized. As we have shown in the past, we will only engage in projects if the potential benefits to PyroGenesis is significant and well-understood. We continue to intensify our focus on project and budgetary clarity during this persistent period of elevated global inflationary pressures, by sourcing alternative suppliers and constantly adjusting project resources. We have also refined our early-stage project assessment process to allow for faster “go / no-go” decisions on project viability. Enhanced Sales and Marketing Against the backdrop of this 3-tiered strategy, the Company has been increasing sales, marketing, and R&D efforts in-line with – and in some cases ahead of – the growth curve for industrial change related to greenhouse gas reduction efforts. In September, the Company was featured as a cover story in Powder Metallurgy Review, a premier business magazine serving the additive manufacturing and metals industries. The multi-page article detailed PyroGenesis Additive’s journey to becoming a player in the titanium metal powder production market with its new NexGen production technology. During the quarter, the Company proudly participated in both the “5th Symposium on Iron Ore Pelletizing” in Quebec City, and also in the Côte-Nord tour organized by AluQuébec - Grappe industrielle de l'aluminium du Québec. The latter of the two events was an invitation-only event which gathered over 25 partners and equipment manufacturers from various industry sectors. Business Line Developments The upcoming milestones which are expected to confirm the validity of our strategies are outlined below (please note that these timelines are estimates based on information provided to use by the Clients/Potential Clients, and while we do our best to be accurate, timelines can and will shift, due to protracted negotiations, client technical and resource challenges, or other unexpected situations beyond our or the Clients’ control): Business Line Developments: Near Term (0 – 3 months) 1. Energy Transition & Emission Reduction New Industry Contract for Plasma Torches:The Company is currently negotiating a large first-phase contract in excess of $10 million that would signal PyroGenesis’ resumption of work in an industry that previously showed promise. This industry, which shall remain confidential at present, has previously heralded the potential use of plasma torches in conducting its primary objective, due to the increased speed and other advanced criteria at which the projects could be completed by using plasma torches vs traditional approaches. While there is no guarantee this contract will be signed, if successful the Company foresees the potential for a multi-phase, multi-year partnership with the client that may result in many additional plasma torch orders over the next few years. Iron Ore Pelletization Torch Trials:as mentioned in the Q1 outlook on May 15, in April 2023, the commissioning of the plasma torch systems, for use in Client B’s pelletization furnaces, was underway, with the Company’s engineers onsite at the Client’s iron ore facility. The commissioning process includes installation, start-up, and site acceptance testing (SAT). The Company previously announced that it had shipped four 1 MW plasma torch systems for use in Client B’s iron ore pelletization furnaces, for trials toward potentially replacing fossil-fuel burners with plasma torches in the Client’s furnaces. As mentioned in Q2 Outlook, this project continues to move forward, however the commissioning suffered a series of delays, due to damaging regional torrential rainstorms and flooding that damaged the facility’s electrical system and furnace components. Repairs have been ongoing. The Company’s plasma torches have been installed and activated, and the final commissioning and site acceptance testing has resumed, with expectation for final SAT completion within the next few weeks. The Client has informed us that they continued to experience technical challenges of their own at different stages during Q3, and the site acceptance testing (SAT) was not completed as expected during the quarter. While this is understandably frustrating, the project is not in any jeopardy, and the Client remains committed to the trials. As of this date, November 9, the Client B has indicated that they were continuing to move forward in resolving their own technical and supply chain issues. Client B is confident that the issues are minor comparatively, and that the acceptance testing, and full trials will be back on track once certain components on backorder are received. Although the timeframe is uncertain, it is expected to be achieved before the end of the year. Client A, a large international mining company who has also purchased a full plasma torch system for use in trials in their pelletization furnaces, has recently informed the Company that they continue their plasma torch initiative at their own pace. 2.Commodity Security & Optimization Product Qualification Process for Global Aerospace Firm: Based on information flow between the Company and the aerospace client previously announced, the Company believes that the 2-year long qualification process to approve the Company’s titanium metal powers for use by a global aerospace firm and their suppliers, will conclude in the near term. Of note, the Company can confirm that the qualification process also now includes PyroGenesis’ “coarse cut” titanium metal powder, in addition to the “fine cut” titanium metal powder that has been previously discussed as part of the qualification process. 3. Waste Remediation Post-Quarter End:In October, the Company announced a contract for $360,000 (Press Release dated October 24, 2023) for a lab-scale size version of the Company’s plasma arc chemical warfare agent destruction system (known as “PACWADS”) from a European engineering services firm undertaking the discovery and safe destruction of chemical warfare agents within the European Union. The first phase lab-scale order, part of a potential three-phase project, is in relation to a multi-partner project aimed at identifying, extracting, and disposing of chemical munitions and chemical warfare agents residing in active marine passageways and corridors. The second phase will consist of testing the PACWADs system to validate its efficiency, performance and capacity. The eventual goal is to develop a full-scale system once results from the lab-scale system are reviewed. Potential PAWDS Order:The Company is in initial negotiations with a company that conducts cleanup and destruction of waste from seawater. They have also indicated interest in doing the same on land in remote locations. Negotiations for a PyroGenesis Plasma Arc Waste Destruction System (PAWDS), similar to the type the Company designed and built for some of the U.S. Navy aircraft carriers, are in early stage. While there is no guarantee this contract is completed, if successful the Company may be contracted for multiple PAWDS systems over time. Financial Payments for Outstanding Major Receivables:The Company remains in continuous discussions with Radian Oil and Gas Services Company regarding the outstanding receivable of approximately US$8.0 million under the Company’s existing $25 million+ Drosrite™ contract. As previously announced, PyroGenesis agreed to a strategic extension of the payment plan, by the customer and its end-customer, geared to better align the pressures on the end-user’s operating cash flows created by increased business opportunities. These discussions are positive, both in regard to the ongoing payment plan, and in regards to a potential new order of additional Drosrite™ systems, as the client’s cash flow situation and their new business opportunities move closer to resolution. Innovation Grants:as mentioned in the Q1 outlook on May 15 and Q2 outlook on August 10, the Company has applied for grants tailored to technology innovation and/or carbon reduction and expects to have results regarding these applications. While the results are ultimately positive for the Company, the Company is still awaiting formal government announcement of the grants before it is legally allowed to indicate specifics. These grants are in the order of $1-2 million. Business Line Developments: Mid Term (3 – 6 months) 1. Aluminum Remelting Furnaces: As mentioned in the Q2 Outlook for Q3, the Company has been working on the development of aluminum remelting furnace solutions using plasma, for use by secondary aluminum producers or any manufacturer of aluminum components that uses recycled or scrap aluminum. With gas-fired furnaces responsible for much of the scope 1 emissions of secondary aluminum production, aluminum companies have been searching for solutions that can help in the decarbonization efforts of aluminum remelting and cast houses. The Company has two concepts: the retro-fitting of plasma torches in existing remelting and cast house furnaces that currently use other forms of heating, such as natural gas; and the manufacturing and sale of a PyroGenesis produced furnace based off the Company’s existing Drosrite metal recovery furnace design, which has been in use commercially for several years. Also as mentioned in the Q2 Outlook, the Company has been working with a number of different companies over the past few years towards these goals. The results from the conclusion of recent major tests, conducted in conjunction with these companies, have been very positive, and negotiations are underway for next step deployments and sales, with announcements forthcoming. These negotiations continue, though we now anticipate this being a Q1 2024 initiative, if announced. 2. Fumed Silica Reactor (“FSR”) Project: Fumed Silica (also known as Pyrogenic Silica) is a particle-size food-safe additive with a large surface area, used worldwide as a thickening agent in thousands of products such as milkshakes, adhesives, powdered foods, paints, inks, cosmetics, and beverages, to increase strength, viscosity, and flow control. PyroGenesis, on behalf of its client HPQ Silicon Inc., developed the Fumed Silica Reactor, a plasma-based process that creates fumed silica from quartz in a single and eco-friendly step. By eliminating the use of harmful chemicals generated by conventional fumed silica production methods, the groundbreaking FSR approach, if successful, will help contribute to the repatriation of silica production to North America while lowering the CO2 emissions and carbon footprint of the process. In a major step towards commercial-scale production, PyroGenesis has successfully deployed (news release dated Oct 3, 2023) the FSR on a laboratory scale to produce fumed silica. A subsequent independent analysis (news release dated Nov 9, 2023) of the material conducted by McGill University confirmed the commercial-quality and thickening efficiency of the fumed silica produced by the FSR. Next step is to build and launch a pilot plant in Q2 2024 for pre-commercial sample batch production. In addition to being the engineering services provider and developer of the forthcoming pilot plant, PyroGenesis owns a 10% royalty of client HPQ’s eventual fumed silica sales, with set minimums. This royalty stream, can, at any time, be converted by PyroGenesis into a 50% ownership in HPQ Silica Polvere Inc., the wholly owned subsidiary of HPQ Silicon that controls the fumed silica initiative and rights. Please note that projects or potential projects previously announced that do not appear in the above summary updates should not be considered as at risk. Noteworthy developments can occur at any time based on project stages, and the information presented above is a reflection of information on hand. Projects not mentioned have simply not concluded or not passed milestones worthy of discussion. Status as a Dual-Listed Publicly Traded Company As part of the Company’s proactive risk management strategy, the Company announced in its Q2 news release (Press Release dated August 10, 2023) that it was evaluating the costs and benefits of maintaining a dual listing on both Nasdaq and the TSX. That ongoing evaluation entailed an analysis of several key factors, including (i) the financial costs associated with being on each exchange, such as insurance costs, regulatory compliance costs, legal fees, and accounting fees, (ii) the volume of trading on both exchanges, and (iii) the regulatory and compliance requirements of each exchange. As stated at the time, costs to PyroGenesis associated to its dual listing in the US are considerable, with incremental US-specific fees related to directors & officer insurance, legal, listing and filings, and accounting, of more than $2.2 million, which would require approximately $6-8 million in revenues. Post quarter end, on October 27, 2023, after careful consideration, the Board of Director’s decided and the Company announced it would be voluntarily delisting from the Nasdaq exchange. This decision would not affect its listing in Canada, and the Company would remain listed on the Toronto Stock exchange. In addition, the Company has taken steps to have its Shares quoted on the OTCQX Best Market. The Company has initiated the Nasdaq delisting process and has filed a Form 25 with the SEC for the removal of its Shares from Nasdaq’s listing. This Form is anticipated to become effective 10 days following its filling, resulting in the delisting of the Company’s Shares from Nasdaq on or about November 16, 2023. Administrative Proceedings As previously announced by the Company (see Press Release dated August 31, 2023), in August 2023, the Autorité des marchés financiers (the “AMF”) initiated administrative proceedings against Mr. Peter Pascali, President and CEO, Mr. Alan Curleigh, Chair of the Board of Directors, and the Company with the Tribunal administratif des marchés financiers. The allegations largely relate to a series of connected transactions that occurred in 2018. The administrative penalty sought by the AMF and attributable to the Company is $550,000. The Company remains of the view that the AMF’s allegations are without merit and, like Mr. Pascali and Mr. Curleigh, the Company looks forward to having the opportunity to defend itself, and be vindicated, before the tribunal. Financial Summary 1. Revenues PyroGenesis recorded revenue of $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 (“Q3, 2023”), representing a decrease of $2.0 million compared with $5.7 million recorded in the third quarter of 2022 (“Q3, 2022”). Revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, was $9.3 million, a decrease of $6.4 million over revenue of $15.7 million compared to the same period in 2022. Revenues recorded in Q3 2023 were generated primarily from: Q3, 2023 revenues decreased by $2.0 million in comparison to Q3, 2022, mainly as a result of: During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, revenues decreased by $6.4 million, mainly as a result of: As of November 9, 2023, revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to backlog of signed and/or awarded contracts is $35 million. Revenue will be recognized as the Company satisfies its performance obligations under long-term contracts, which is expected to occur over a maximum period of approximately 3 years. Cost of Sales and Services and Gross Margins Cost of sales and services were $2.6 million in Q3 2023, representing an increase of $1.0 million compared to $1.5 million in Q3, 2022, primarily due to a decrease of $0.1 million in employee compensation, a decrease of $0.3 million in subcontracting, attributed to additional work being completed in-house and the reversal of subcontracting related to our work completed in Italy with our Italian subsidiary, an increase in direct materials of $0.5 million due to the purchasing of material related to newly awarded contract/projects, a decrease in manufacturing overhead & other and investment tax credits of $0.02 million and $0.01 million, respectively, and a decrease in foreign exchange on materials due to the reclassification of the expense from Cost of Sales and Services to Selling, General and Administrative expenses. The gross margin for Q3, 2023 was $1.1 million or 30% of revenue compared to a gross margin of $4.1 million or 73% of revenue for Q3 2022, the decrease in gross margin was mainly attributable to the reduced sales volume generating less gross profit and to the impact on foreign exchange charge on materials, and more significantly, the $3.6 million sale of IP in 2022 which was not repeated in the current quarter, and had 100% gross margin profit. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, cost of sales and services were $6.6 million compared to $8.0 million for the same period in the prior year, the $1.5 million decrease is primarily due to a decrease of $1.1 million in subcontracting (nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 - $1.2 million), attributed to additional work being completed in-house, a decrease in direct materials and manufacturing overhead & other of $1.2 million and $0.3 million respectively (nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 - $3.7 million and $1.1 million respectively), due to lower levels of material required based on the decrease in product and service-related revenues and the negative impact of the foreign exchange charge on material of $1.2 million. The amortization of intangible assets for Q3, 2023 was $0.2 million compared to $0.2 million for Q3, 2022, and during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, was $0.7 million compared to $0.7 million for the same period in the prior year. This expense relates mainly to the intangible assets in connection with the Pyro Green-Gas acquisition, patents and deferred development costs. These expenses are non-cash items, and the intangible assets will be amortized over the expected useful lives. As a result of the type of contracts being executed, the nature of the project activity, as well as the composition of the cost of sales and services, as the mix between labour, materials and subcontracts may be significantly different. In addition, due to the nature of these long-term contracts, the Company has not necessarily passed on to the customer, the increased cost of sales which was attributable to inflation, if any. The costs of sales and services are in line with management’s expectations and with the nature of the revenue. 3.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Included within Selling, General and Administrative expenses (“SG&A”) are costs associated with corporate administration, business development, project proposals, operations administration, investor relations and employee training. SG&A expenses for Q3, 2023 were $7.6 million, representing an increase of $1.7 million compared to $5.9 million for Q3, 2022. The variation is mainly a result of the expected credit loss & bad debt provision increasing to $2.8 million in Q3, 2023, whereby no such expense was recorded in the comparable period. Furthermore, this was offset by a decrease in professional fees which are $0.8 million, thereby a decrease of $0.4 million (Q3, 2022 - $1.3 million), due to reduction in accounting fees, legal and investor relation, and patent expenses. Other expenses also decreased by $0.2 million (Q3, 2022 - $1.0 million) due to a net reduction of insurance expenses, and a favourable impact of $0.2 million on the foreign exchange charge on materials. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, SG&A expenses were $21.6 million, representing an increase of $2.9 million compared to $18.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase is mainly a result of employee compensation increasing to $7.2 million (nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 - $5.6 million) mainly caused by additional headcount. Expected credit loss & bad debt increased to $4.8 million and is due to an increase in the allowance for expected credit losses recognized in 2023, and the increase of the impact on foreign exchange charge on materials of $0.09 million, offset by the decreases of $0.6 million in professional fees, due to less legal, accounting and investor relation expenses, which are $3.1 million, compared to $3.7 million in the comparable period, and the decrease in other expenses, mainly related to the decrease of subcontracting and insurance expenses, to $2.5 million from $3.4 million, a variation of $0.9 million, compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022. Share-based compensation expense for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, was $0.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively (three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 - $0.9 million and $4.2 million, respectively), a decrease of $0.3 million and $1.8 million respectively, which is a non-cash item and relates mainly to 2021, 2022 and 2023 grants. Share-based payments expenses as explained above, are non-cash expenses and are directly impacted by the vesting structure of the stock option plan whereby options vest between 10% and up to 100% on the grant date and may require an immediate recognition of that cost. 4.Depreciation on Property and Equipment The depreciation on property and equipment for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 remained stable at $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, compared with $0.2 million and $0.4 million for the same periods in the prior year. The expense is determined by the nature and useful lives of the property and equipment being depreciated. 5.Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenses During the three-months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred $0.7 million of R&D costs on internal projects, an increase of $0.4 million as compared with $0.3 million in Q3, 2022. The increase in Q3, 2023 is primarily related to an increase of $0.2 million in employee compensation to $0.4 million, due to an increase in R&D activities which required additional labour resources, compared to $0.2 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase in materials and equipment and other expenses, to $0.3 million (Q3, 2022 - $0.1 million), which is also attributable to the increase in employee compensation. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred $1.7 million of R&D costs on internal projects, compared to $1.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase is mainly due to higher levels of R&D activities requiring additional resources and other expenses, increasing to $1.3 million as compared with $0.8 million, an increase of $0.5 million, which is offset by the decrease in material and equipment to $0.4 million compared to $0.7 million for the same period in the prior year. In addition to internally funded R&D projects, the Company also incurred R&D expenditures during the execution of client funded projects. These expenses are eligible for Scientific Research and Experimental Development (“SR&ED”) tax credits. SR&ED tax credits on client funded projects are applied against cost of sales and services (see “Cost of Sales” section 2). 6.Finance Costs (income), net Finance costs for Q3 2023 represent an expense of $0.03 million, representing an increase year-over-year of approximately $0.2 million. The increase in finance expenses in Q3 2023, is primarily due to the interest and accretion related to the convertible debenture offset by the Interest accretion on and revaluation of balance due on business combination. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, the finance costs represent an income of $1.6 million as compared with an expense of $0.5 million for the 2022 comparable period, representing a favourable variation of $2.2 million year-over-year. The decrease in finance expenses is primarily due to the revaluation of balance due on business combination due to negotiations between the Company’s Italian subsidiary and a customer who both agreed on the final acceptance of a contract, prior to final completion and the Company determined that a milestone related to the business combination would not be achieved. As a result, the contract did not attain the pre-determined milestone in connection with the balance due on business combination, and reversals of the liabilities were recorded. 7.Strategic Investments During the three-months ended September 30, 2023, the adjustment to fair market value of strategic investments for Q3, 2023 resulted in a gain of $1.2 million compared to a loss in the amount of $1.8 million in Q3, 2022, a favorable variation of $3.0 million. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2023, the adjustment to fair market value of strategic investments resulted in a gain of $0.2 million compared to a loss in the amount of $8.1 million for the same period in the prior year, a favorable variation of $8.3 million. The increase in gain for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, is attributable to the variation of the market value of the common shares owned by the Company of HPQ Silicon Inc. 8. Comprehensive Loss The comprehensive loss for Q3, 2023 of $6.3 million compared to a loss of $4.1 million, in Q3, 2022, represents a variation of $2.2 million, and is primarily attributable to the factors described above, which have been summarized as follows: The comprehensive loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, of $18.7 million compared to a loss of $21.2 million, for the same period in the prior year, represents a variation of $2.4 million, and is primarily attributable to the factors described above, which have been summarized as follows: 9. Liquidity and Capital Resources As at September 30, 2023, the Company had cash of $0.9 million, included in the net working capital deficiency of $6.4 million. Certain working capital items such as billings in excess of costs and profits on uncompleted contracts do not represent a direct outflow of cash. The Company expects that with its cash, liquidity position, the proceeds available from the strategic investment and access to capital markets it will be able to finance its operations for the foreseeable future. The Company’s term loan balance at September 30, 2023 was $396,675, and varied only slightly since December 31, 2022. The increase from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022, was mainly attributable to the additional proceeds received on the Economic Development Agency of Canada loan, which is interest free and will remain so, until the balance is paid over the 60-month period ending March 2029. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, the Company issued convertible debenture units for gross proceeds of $3,030,000, and bear interest at 10%. The average interest expense on the other term loans and convertible debenture is approximately 10%. The Company does not expect changes to the structure of term loans in the next twelve-month period. The Company maintained one credit facilities which bears interest at a variable rate of prime plus 1%, therefore 8.20% at September 30, 2023. The Company continued to reimburse a portion of the existing credit facility during Q3 2023. About PyroGenesis Canada Inc.

Around 1.6 million people in Somalia could be affected by the heavy seasonal downpours, which have been worsened by the combined impact of two climate phenomenons, El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement late on Thursday. The floods, which followed heavy rains that started in early October, have already killed at least 29 people and forced more than 300,000 from their homes in Somalia, and inundated towns and villages across northern Kenya. Camps for people displaced by an Islamist insurgency and the worst drought in four decades have also been flooded, causing people to flee for a second time, aid groups say. Large-scale displacement, increased humanitarian needs and further destruction of property remain likely, OCHA said, with some 1.5 million hectares (3.70 million acres)of farmland potentially being destroyed. ""Extreme weather linked to the ongoing El Nino risks further driving up humanitarian needs in already-vulnerable communities in Somalia and many other places,"" said Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General, the UN's Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. ""We know what the risks are, and we need to get ahead of these looming crises,"" he said.","['somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'sweden', 'kenya']",in,False,False

France replaces Italy, who has held the top production spot for the past 9 years. However, France’s rise to the top spot wasn’t due to planting more vineyards, but because so many other large wine producing countries were afflicted by extreme weather patterns that decimated their grape crops. “Once again extreme climatic conditions like early frost, heavy rainfall, and drought have significantly impacted the output of the world vineyard. Meteorological anomalies are becoming the new normality,” explained Giorgio Delgrosso, Head of Statistics & Digital Transformation Department with the OIV, in a webinar. Each year the OIV collects data on the vineyard and global wine production, focusing on the 29 countries which produce 94% of the world’s wine. Despite France’s bountiful 2023 harvest (preliminary estimates of 45.8 mhl), in prior years it was also the victim of extreme heat and frost, causing loss of wine grapes, especially in 2021. Examples of countries that were on the losing side this year were Spain, which fell 14% in production, primarily due to drought conditions, and Italy, with a 12% decrease due to heavy rains resulting in mildew that destroys grapes. Many South American countries saw record decreases in crop sizes due to drought and wildfires, with Argentina down 23%, Chile down 20%, Brazil down 30% and Uruguay down a whopping 34%. This trend continued in Australia where a reduction of 24% was recorded, with South Africa documenting a 10% decrease in wine grape production. 2023 Estimated Global Wine Production in mhl from Top 10 Countries Because of the extreme weather conditions, Delgrosso reported that, “In 2023, world wine production is expected to be the smallest in the last 60 years.” The few other countries that had average grape crop sizes this year were the U.S., New Zealand, Romania, Portugal and Bulgaria, though both the U.S. and New Zealand were down in 2022 due to a combination of droughts, heavy rains and frost. For anyone who doesn’t believe climate change is real, just spend some time in a vineyard. Wine grapes are one of the most sensitive of agriculture crops, and the extreme weather variations, and rising temperatures and green-house gases documented by NASA, NOA and other agencies, are having a negative effect on production. A Blessing in Disguise? However, perhaps the lower wine grape production levels in 2023 aren’t all doom and gloom, because global wine sales have been falling in the last several years. This is especially the case in Europe, where younger consumers are not adopting wine as much as their elders. A recent report by Barron showed that wine consumption fell by 34% in Portugal, 22% in Germany and 10% in Spain in the last year alone. And though the numbers are not as dour in the U.S., wine volume sales have fallen by 4.5% and value sales are down 1% in the past 52 weeks since July 2023, according to a NielsenIQ presentation at a Wine Market Council webinar. In a strange way, perhaps Mother Nature is trying to help global wine production to come into balance. This is because when there is over-production, EU countries often pay farmers to pull out the grape vines and/or convert the crops to alcohol, which can be used for hand sanitizer and other products. In fact in France earlier this year, the government announced they are paying farmers $215 million to convert the grapes to alcohol, to help offset France’s large crop. 2023 Global Wine Production Lowest in 60 Years In Tough Times, Innovative New Wine Brands Can Be Developed In the U.S., where the government rarely pays subsidies to grape farmers, times of over production with a surplus of wine grapes on the market and falling consumption have often given way to innovative new products. For example in 1979, when consumption had flattened in the U.S. and the crop was large, Bartle’s and James wine coolers were developed, ushering in 5-years of solid growth in wine coolers. With the next decline in the late 1980’s, 60-Minutes broke the story on the ‘French paradox’ in 1991, and suddenly red wines were popular, especially Merlot. When consumption dipped again in 2001 and there was a very large high-quality California grape crop, Franzia Wine company developed ‘Two-Buck Chuck’ for Trader Jo’s. The quality of the grapes was so high in the beginning that the $2 chardonnay actually was awarded high scores by critics, and it flew off shelves. U.S. Wine Consumption From 1930 to 2022 Then with the 2008 dip in consumption and another healthy grape crop, Gallo introduced Apothetic red blends whose fruity, semi-sweet flavors were met with positive consumer response, ushering in a huge trend in ‘red blends’. Now the U.S. wine industry is at another crossroads with a large healthy grape crop and decreasing consumer wine consumption. It is time for product innovation again.","['france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'italy', 'italy', 'spain', 'spain', 'argentina', 'chile', 'brazil', 'uruguay', 'australia', 'southafrica', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'newzealand', 'newzealand', 'romania', 'portugal', 'portugal', 'bulgaria', 'germany', 'unitedstates']",us,True,False

Not the usual gauzy pitch to voters. But in Tuesday'selection, the onetime scribe and heavy metal singer scored her fourth election victory, breaking through to the state Senate and overcoming a pitched effort from Republicans and their allies to use her transgender identity as a cudgel. In one of the latest battles in America's culture wars, Republicans across the country tried in this year's voting to make the embrace of trans rights a powerful, emotional argument against Democratic candidates who they said had violated social norms. Against Roem, it didn't work. Roem, 39, already had two comfortable reelection victories in her northern Virginia House of Delegates district. Now, Roem has helped Democrats achieve full legislative control in an election that broadly repudiated the far right and promises to stall the social conservative agenda of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. “The only difference between this campaign and my three campaigns for the House of Delegates is they put a lot more money into promoting a transphobic message that lost as opposed to a moderate amount or a little amount of money into a transphobic message that lost,” Roem told The Associated Press. “They will keep losing by doing this over and over and over again.” Despite the limited races in the off-year elections, theLGBTQ+ Victory Fund lists 148 openly LGBTQ+ candidates who won across the country Tuesday. The lesson from this “rainbow wave,” said Annise Parker, the fund’s president and a former Houston mayor: “Equality wins elections — not culture war scare tactics.” Roem “faced an unprecedented deluge of anti-trans hate on the campaign trail, but she was not fazed nor distracted,"" Parker said. That deluge included some 30 negative mass mailings, several “fake positive” ones and ads accusing of her of wanting to allow “boys to play in girls' sports.” One national organization distributed mass mailers giving out her personal cellphone number and imploring people to use it to “put the heat on Danica Roem."" No flood of hostile callers followed, she said. Only two folks who saw the mailers phoned her and she’s having lunch with one of them to talk things through. “The other side decided that their closing message was going to be to double, triple and quadruple down on transphobia,” she said. But she had brought to the campaign her secret sauce for success, learned from days reporting on local politics: “No matter what office you run for, always run like you’re running for mayor. That’s what I did.” ___ By 2016, Roem had slept in more than 60 parking lots across the country from meandering road trips and gigs as a moonlighting metal rocker with day jobs in local journalism. In that time she carefully ranked the 40 best lots for free overnight parking, choosing a Delaware rest stop off Interstate 95 as tops because of the always open bathrooms, the vending machines and lights that weren't too bright for sleep. “Nothing about my life screams ‘electable’ (or even ‘hygienic’) on paper,” she observed in her 2022 memoir, “Burn the Page: A True Story of Torching Doubts, Blazing Trails, and Igniting Change.” Yet she had caught the eye of Democrats and activists in her frequent trips to the Capitol in Richmond to advocate against anti-gay bills from Republicans, and they sounded her out about running. While engaging a variety of lawmakers in Richmond, she judged the deeply conservative delegate from her own district, Bob Marshall, a lost cause. After all, he had once proudly called himself Virginia’s “chief homophobe.” Instead of lobbying him, she defeated him. Her victory in a 2017 House of Delegates race made her the first openly transgender candidate to win and take a legislative seat in the United States. ___ As a trailblazer for trans politicians, Roem is celebrated in Democratic and cultural circles. But as a legislator with a solid record of writing bills and getting some big ones passed, she is known for her passion for the prosaic, such as traffic congestion. Perhaps channeling the road rage that once made her unleash swear words from her 24-year-old Dodge, Roem has been in the thick of the debate over roads since she first ran. She calls Route 28, snaking through her area’s suburban sprawl past Dulles Airport, an obsession. Her slogan for the 2023 campaign was “Fixing roads, feeding kids.” Much of Roem’s social media feed reads like a transportation diary — or the work of a mayor. “Update,” she says in a typical post, “all three of the southbound lanes are now all open in Centreville from 29 to just before the Bull Run bridge, so if you’re taking Route 28 home to Manassas from I-66, you won’t get stuck in that right turn lane in front of the movie theater.” This year, pushing initiatives she's already fought for as a delegate, she pitched voters on improving storm water management. On keeping the tech sector’s data centers away from parks and homes. On putting new transmission lines underground. She counts Virginia's expansion of Medicaid under the former Democratic governor as a key accomplishment. It’s a long way from her kabob-shop days and from her short-lived mobile yoga studio venture, where clients did their moves to a head-banging Swedish metal soundtrack. ___ Many U.S. campaigns employ an “opposition research” team to poke through an opponent’s past. In her first two campaigns, Roem had her own past investigated, to avoid being blindsided. Oh that hurt, she writes. “For those of us who grew up in the age of social media, it can be an exercise in demented self-loathing to figure out just how much of your history the public can truly stomach.” Sure enough, Marshall's 2017 campaign surfaced a suggestive music video from Roem's metal band, Cab Ride Home. “Lewd,” Marshall told voters. Insisting on calling his opponent by male pronouns, he also played up Roem's comment in a radio interview when asked if she would support teaching kindergarteners about gender identity. Yes, she said, if the instruction were age-appropriate. She defeated Marshall with 54% of the vote to his 46% and posted similar margins in the next two elections before taking a narrower victory Tuesday over a former police detective, Bill Woolf III, with 52%. In a phone interview, Roem rattled off a heavy list of legislative priorities. They include free school meals for all public school students, earmarking 10% of general fund surplus dollars to transportation safety projects, five bills to control data-center sprawl, and an initiative to secure rights for people to be buried in family cemeteries that are located on private property.

Not the usual gauzy pitch to voters. But in Tuesday'selection, the onetime scribe and heavy metal singer scored her fourth election victory, breaking through to the state Senate and overcoming a pitched effort from Republicans and their allies to use her transgender identity as a cudgel. In one of the latest battles in America's culture wars, Republicans across the country tried in this year's voting to make the embrace of trans rights a powerful, emotional argument against Democratic candidates who they said had violated social norms. Against Roem, it didn't work. Roem, 39, already had two comfortable reelection victories in her northern Virginia House of Delegates district. Now, Roem has helped Democrats achieve full legislative control in an election that broadly repudiated the far right and promises to stall the social conservative agenda of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. “The only difference between this campaign and my three campaigns for the House of Delegates is they put a lot more money into promoting a transphobic message that lost as opposed to a moderate amount or a little amount of money into a transphobic message that lost,” Roem told The Associated Press. “They will keep losing by doing this over and over and over again.” Despite the limited races in the off-year elections, theLGBTQ+ Victory Fund lists 148 openly LGBTQ+ candidates who won across the country Tuesday. The lesson from this “rainbow wave,” said Annise Parker, the fund’s president and a former Houston mayor: “Equality wins elections — not culture war scare tactics.” Roem “faced an unprecedented deluge of anti-trans hate on the campaign trail, but she was not fazed nor distracted,"" Parker said. That deluge included some 30 negative mass mailings, several “fake positive” ones and ads accusing of her of wanting to allow “boys to play in girls' sports.” One national organization distributed mass mailers giving out her personal cellphone number and imploring people to use it to “put the heat on Danica Roem."" No flood of hostile callers followed, she said. Only two folks who saw the mailers phoned her and she’s having lunch with one of them to talk things through. “The other side decided that their closing message was going to be to double, triple and quadruple down on transphobia,” she said. But she had brought to the campaign her secret sauce for success, learned from days reporting on local politics: “No matter what office you run for, always run like you’re running for mayor. That’s what I did.” ___ By 2016, Roem had slept in more than 60 parking lots across the country from meandering road trips and gigs as a moonlighting metal rocker with day jobs in local journalism. In that time she carefully ranked the 40 best lots for free overnight parking, choosing a Delaware rest stop off Interstate 95 as tops because of the always open bathrooms, the vending machines and lights that weren't too bright for sleep. “Nothing about my life screams ‘electable’ (or even ‘hygienic’) on paper,” she observed in her 2022 memoir, “Burn the Page: A True Story of Torching Doubts, Blazing Trails, and Igniting Change.” Yet she had caught the eye of Democrats and activists in her frequent trips to the Capitol in Richmond to advocate against anti-gay bills from Republicans, and they sounded her out about running. While engaging a variety of lawmakers in Richmond, she judged the deeply conservative delegate from her own district, Bob Marshall, a lost cause. After all, he had once proudly called himself Virginia’s “chief homophobe.” Instead of lobbying him, she defeated him. Her victory in a 2017 House of Delegates race made her the first openly transgender candidate to win and take a legislative seat in the United States. ___ As a trailblazer for trans politicians, Roem is celebrated in Democratic and cultural circles. But as a legislator with a solid record of writing bills and getting some big ones passed, she is known for her passion for the prosaic, such as traffic congestion. Perhaps channeling the road rage that once made her unleash swear words from her 24-year-old Dodge, Roem has been in the thick of the debate over roads since she first ran. She calls Route 28, snaking through her area’s suburban sprawl past Dulles Airport, an obsession. Her slogan for the 2023 campaign was “Fixing roads, feeding kids.” Much of Roem’s social media feed reads like a transportation diary — or the work of a mayor. “Update,” she says in a typical post, “all three of the southbound lanes are now all open in Centreville from 29 to just before the Bull Run bridge, so if you’re taking Route 28 home to Manassas from I-66, you won’t get stuck in that right turn lane in front of the movie theater.” This year, pushing initiatives she's already fought for as a delegate, she pitched voters on improving storm water management. On keeping the tech sector’s data centers away from parks and homes. On putting new transmission lines underground. She counts Virginia's expansion of Medicaid under the former Democratic governor as a key accomplishment. It’s a long way from her kabob-shop days and from her short-lived mobile yoga studio venture, where clients did their moves to a head-banging Swedish metal soundtrack. ___ Many U.S. campaigns employ an “opposition research” team to poke through an opponent’s past. In her first two campaigns, Roem had her own past investigated, to avoid being blindsided. Oh that hurt, she writes. “For those of us who grew up in the age of social media, it can be an exercise in demented self-loathing to figure out just how much of your history the public can truly stomach.” Sure enough, Marshall's 2017 campaign surfaced a suggestive music video from Roem's metal band, Cab Ride Home. “Lewd,” Marshall told voters. Insisting on calling his opponent by male pronouns, he also played up Roem's comment in a radio interview when asked if she would support teaching kindergarteners about gender identity. Yes, she said, if the instruction were age-appropriate. She defeated Marshall with 54% of the vote to his 46% and posted similar margins in the next two elections before taking a narrower victory Tuesday over a former police detective, Bill Woolf III, with 52%. In a phone interview, Roem rattled off a heavy list of legislative priorities. They include free school meals for all public school students, earmarking 10% of general fund surplus dollars to transportation safety projects, five bills to control data-center sprawl, and an initiative to secure rights for people to be buried in family cemeteries that are located on private property. She also chronicled her sad history of car ownership. There was the ant-infested Subaru Outback given to her by her mom — “almost killed me twice in one day,” she said of the vehicle. And the “dirty Dodge” she bought from her drummer's dad for $700.

Former Hells Angel Tim Wayne Medvitz has had some big ideas in the past decade and a half. One is to use his mountaineering skills to take seriously injured military veterans on climbs up the world’s highest peaks. The Heroes Project charity he created after a motorcycle accident shattered his body and life has been doing this since 2009, even summiting Everest. One of THP’s principal training grounds, the strikingly beautiful Mt. Baldy in Southern California, inspired the group’s latest effort, creating a veteran retreat center. This complex of cabins and recreational buildings will be built on United States Forest Service property in Icehouse Canyon, two miles from Mt. Baldy Village (and driving distance from Los Angeles). Barring any unforeseen crises, the project will break ground in early 2024 and hopefully open in Fall 2025, Medvitz predicted, adding in an email, “It’s been a four year journey just to get the USFS to approve this project.” Challenging Site The group founder is undaunted by the property’s history of flooding and fire, or the namesake trail’s killer reputation. (The Los Angeles Times described it this way in a February 2, 2023 article: “That familiarity and easy access from a huge urban area have combined to give the mountain one of the worst records for death and injury in the U.S.. Since 2020, there have been more than 100 searches for missing hikers on Mt. Baldy, with six confirmed deaths, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department.” British actor Julian Sands lost his life on that trail hiking solo last winter. So far, none of those deaths, injuries or search and rescues have been associated with THP’s veteran training or volunteer fundraising events. (I participated* in the latter once in 2014, and found the Devil’s Backbone section of the trail aptly named; the hikespeak blog dubbed it “spine tingling” in an undated post.) Medvitz, whose team has had to address dangerous conditions with THP’s climbs – including an avalanche and earthquake en route to a record-setting Everest summit by a Marine amputee – is not intimidated by Baldy’s physical (or development) challenges. He’s just plainly excited about bringing more vets in to enjoy the strikingly beautiful surroundings, each other’s company and new adventures to be planned there. “After 10 years and thousands of hours of dreaming, drafting, designing, and negotiating, THP is proud to announce that effective, June 29th, 2023 the United States Forest Service special use permit is officially signed and in our hands!” his website proclaims. “Every detail of the VRC has been designed so that our veterans can disconnect from life's everyday stresses and reconnect with the soldier/Marine that has been lost.” Given these new accommodations, the site notes, “We are able to offer temporary housing and a taste of the great outdoors, all part of our transformative experience.” Resilience “The only way to build a facility like this on USFS land would be to have an existing special use permit grandfathered in on the land,” Medvitz explained in his note. “The Old Icehouse resort had exactly that and needed to be brought back to life; we will do that in partnership with the USFS and with a great cause behind it. As far as floods and fire hazards are concerned, well, any mountain retreat will bring everything that mother nature throws at it,” he mused, then added that all of the Forest Service’s requirements for safety will be met. California’s wildfires have become more frequent and intense in recent years, including in Baldy’s home range, so resilience planning is a necessary precaution. Wounded Warrior Housing Assisting the relentless adventurer in constructing the new retreat center is Scott Youngren, a general contractor for Homes for Our Troops, another nonprofit organization serving combat veterans. Medvitz shared that the builder has created accessible homes for THP alumni as part of his HFOT work, so this new mini mountain compound will be a kind of homecoming for him – and them! San Diego area Marine veteran and double amputee Julian Torres summited Mt. Kilimanjaro with the group and received an adaptive home from HFOT. He lives less than two hours from the new retreat. The new center will include three cabins, two accommodating four guests and one accommodating two. There will also be tent camping spaces and a welcoming/programming center. Building for this population needs to address a range of injuries, both seen and unseen, which Youngren’s experience with HFOT will help inform. These include limb loss, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress. “Mt Baldy and the Baldy community has always delivered on everything needed to pull these vets out of their dark places,” Medvitz noted. The mountain setting can be a boon to those suffering from PTS in particular, but potentially a challenge to those with mobility issues. “We will be ADA compliant,” Medvitz commented. TBI is considered a signature issue of the Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans, which have formed the core of his mountain climbers. “We do focus on primarily post 9/11 combat wounded vets, but we will broaden our veteran outreach in other categories once we’re up and running.” Author’s Note This article is part of a series I dedicate to military-related accommodations every Veteran’s Day and Memorial Day. You can read past stories in my November and May archives going back to 2020. I noted* above that I participated in a fundraiser for The Heroes Project, which merits disclosure. I made two donations of $500 apiece, one in 2014 as part of its Climb for Heroes fundraiser and one the next year for a related documentary (as yet unreleased) about the Everest summit. I do not serve (and never have) in any official capacity with the group.","['mexico', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'iraq']",us,True,True

In it, Pascoe argues many pre-colonial Aboriginal groups were farmers, pointing to examples like eel aquaculture in Victoria, and grain planting and threshing of native millet in the arid center.The debate has drawn in everyone from academics to Aboriginal communities invested in food futures to shock jocks claiming it is a warping of history.For our group of archaeologists and First Nations people, the fact this debate has raged so long suggests there are shortcomings in how we think of food production and how we investigate it in Australian archaeology.Farmers versus foragers is a huge oversimplification of what was a mosaic of food production. After all, Australian landscapes differ markedly, from tropical rainforest to snowy mountains to arid spinifex country. For many Aboriginal people, the terms ""farming"" and ""hunter-gatherer"" do not capture the realities of 60 millennia of food production.In ournew researchpublished in theArchaeology of Food and Foodways, we argue that to better understand millennia-old systems, archaeologists must engage deeply with fields such asplant genetics, ethnobotany, archaeobotany and bioarchaeology as well as listening more carefully to the views of Aboriginal people. Here's how.We need to use better methodsFor decades, archaeologists have grappled with the task of understanding ancient food production. We are by no means the first to point to the lack of appropriate methods as a reason why this has proved hard.ArchaeobotanistsAnna Florinand Xavier Carah have observed that food production systems in northern Australia are very similar to those in Papua New Guinea. While we accept Papuan food gardens, Australian archaeologists have been less eager to embrace this idea for Australia.In part, this is a failure of terminology. Aboriginal food production was enormously varied.The solution lies in better methods. For instance, many Aboriginal groups lived semi-permanently in gunyah (bark hut) villages, as Dark Emu demonstrates by quoting colonial observers.These settlement sites are vital to gaining a better understanding of how people lived. By excavating gunyah sites and fireplaces where food was prepared, we can recover seeds by sieving dirt and ash to find out which plants people used. The problem? Many of the sieves used were not fine enough to capture the tiny seeds of vital plants such as native millet. Most seeds used by Aboriginal groups were less than 1mm in radius.This can be fixed. In south-west Asia, archeobotanists have long used fine mesh sieves to recover ancient seeds. You also need reference collections of seeds to be able to identify them from fireplaces.Genetics—and archaeology?It might not sound like a natural fit. But around the world, combining plant genetics with archaeology has dramatically changed our understanding of how people used plants, how they moved them about the landscape and how they changed these plants into forms better suiting our use. The wild precursor of corn, for instance,looks almost nothinglike what we molded it into through selection.Combining these approaches is only in its infancy in Australia. But early applications together with Aboriginal knowledge of plant use has revealed dramatic new insights into how Aboriginal people moved important species such asblack beanCastanospermum australe around the landscape and cultivated them.The legacy of these food production techniques may still be visible today. For instance, when we look at the four species of native rice, we would not expect them to have large seeds. But all four species do. For millennia, Aboriginal groups in Australia's wet north farmed these floodplain grasses. They may well have provided someselective pressurethat resulted in larger grains, as early farmers did elsewhere.To date, we don't know this for sure. But we can find out. Careful genetic analysis of remainingwild populationsshould tell us if these large grains came from human rather than natural selection. We can also analyzegenetic diversitybetween wild rice populations, to see if Aboriginal groups were involved in spreading these useful plants further.Stories from ancestral remainsEvery bone tells a story. In your bones lie traces of how fast you grew, what you ate and how hard your life was.Studying ancestral remains is a very sensitive issue due to the colonial practice of collecting Aboriginal remains for research. But when done sensitively and respectfully, it yields fresh insights.Bones and teeth can tell us many things about life in Aboriginal Australia. Tracking changes in isotope ratios in teeth can tell us if people were shifting to a more sedentary way of living. Stress in bones can tell us about difficult food production techniques such as labor-intensive seed grinding.The past can shape the futureAboriginal culture is 60 millennia old, during which time the climate shifted several times. Sea levels rose, flooding the Bass Strait and the coastal plains connecting Cape York to Papua New Guinea.For a culture to survive that long means it had to rely on sustainable food production. Finding out how exactly this was done could yield lost knowledge and make it possible for current-day Aboriginal groups to recapture these methods and crops.To date, renewed interest in bushfoods has not spread far beyond boutique food industries such as gourmet breads and specialized plant foods like Kakadu plum and quandongs.Learning more about drought-resilient crops such as native rice and native millet (Panicum decompositum) could help farmers adapt to climate change and diversify food production. In central Victoria, the Dja Dja Wurrung group is exploring the potential for kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra) for use as a food and as drought-resistant cattle fodder.The better we understand ancient food production, the more likely we are to be able to bring this knowledge to bear on today's challenges—and give a fuller answer to the questions raised by Dark Emu.","['australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'papuanewguinea', 'papuanewguinea']",gb,False,False

She said sewage had washed into the gardens and it left her ""fed up, depressed"" and ""very stressed"". Anglian Water and developer Beal Homes said the surface water flooding was designed to prevent homes flooding. Ms Waterfall said residents on Pitsford Close had previously opened up a drain, leaving a hole in the road, in a bid to get rid of some of the floodwater. She said a nearby attenuation pond, which was supposed to fill with water during heavy rainfall, ""just stays full"". ""I have got to the point now where I want my flat to flood because then they will have to put me in emergency accommodation and it will get me away from here. I'm not coming back,"" she said. ""I'm fed up, depressed, it's affecting my mental health really badly."" Another person living at the development, Stuart Bridge, said he ""felt so sorry"" for the worst-affected residents. ""I have heard of people having toilets backed up and problems with sewage and all sorts of things."" A spokesperson for property developer Beal Homes said the drainage system was ""working exactly as it was designed and approved to do"". They said this included enabling ""some rainwater to back up onto the site infrastructure in the event of extreme rainfall, such as recently"". Anglian Water said the developer had ensured all pipe connections where ""foul was incorrectly piped to the surface water have been resolved"". They said the management of surface water was ""working as intended"" and had been approved by North Kesteven District Council and Lincolnshire County Council at the planning application stage. ""Unfortunately, there will sometimes be weather conditions where rain is extremely heavy or sustained, when the attenuation isn't enough,"" they said. ""When this occurs, the road on Pitsford Close will flood. This flooding, whilst inconvenient, is by design.

The deadliest incident, which lasted for 12 hours, took place in Jenin Refugee Camp, with 13 fatalities. The operation involved armed clashes and air strikes resulting in extensive infrastructure damage in the camp. And turning to Gaza, on the situation there, our colleagues at OCHA tell us that people continued to flee southwards. More than 50,000 people fled yesterday on foot or on other modes of transportation, including donkey carts. Our humanitarian colleagues tell us that more trucks entered Gaza yesterday through the Rafah crossing in Egypt and southern Gaza. But as we have been saying repeatedly, the volume of aid entering Gaza remains wholly inadequate, and more than one entry point is needed. Yesterday, 65 trucks came in — carrying food, medicines, health supplies, bottled water, blankets and hygiene products — as well as seven ambulances. This brings the total number of trucks that have entered Gaza since October 21st to 821. There continues to be damage to health facilities, and they continue also to be impacted by the lack of fuel, with some being forced to close surgical wards and oxygen generation plants. The World Health Organization tells us today that some 12 children with cancer or other blood disorders have been evacuated, with their companions, from Gaza into Egypt and Jordan so they may continue their treatment safely. Additional children are expected to be evacuated for cancer treatment as part of this initiative. The Security Council willmeetat 3:00 p.m. this afternoon to hear a briefing from Dr. Tedros [Gebreyesus], the head of the World Health Organization. He will give you much more details on the health sector in Gaza. In the northern part of the Strip, our colleagues warn that the deteriorating food situation is continuing. Our food security partners have not been able to deliver assistance there in the past eight days. As of yesterday, no bakery was active due to lack of fuel, water and wheat flour as well as damage sustained by many. This is the north. In the south, access to bread is also challenging, as the only operative mill cannot operate due to lack of electricity and fuel. Only one of the bakeries contracted by the World Food Programme, along with eight other bakeries in the south, is able to provide bread intermittently to shelters, obviously, also depending on the availability of fuel and flour. People are lining up for hours in front of bakeries and are exposed to air strikes. Some essential food items, such as rice and vegetable oil, are nearly depleted in the public markets. Other items — including flour, dairy products, eggs and mineral water — have disappeared from the shelves in shops across Gaza in the past two days. For his part, Volker Türk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, today concluded his visit to the Middle East with a press conference in Jordan, where he spoke on what is going on in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. And there is a press release on that. Also, sadly, our colleagues at UNRWA now tell us that 101 UNRWA staff members were confirmed killed in the past month, and there were parents, teachers, nurses, doctors and support staff. Mr. [Philippe] Lazzarini, the Commissioner-General of UNRWA, said that Palestinians are mourning, and Israelis are mourning, and of course all of us at the UN also mourn the loss of our colleagues. As a reminder, on Monday, the UN flag will be lowered at half-mast to pay tribute to our UNRWA colleagues who have lost their lives. That will be the flag in the traffic circle. There will be an opportunity for those who are interested to take photos and video. We will let you know through that media alert the exact time. At 9:30 a.m., all UN offices around the world will observe a minute of silence. 9:30 a.m. local time wherever UN offices are located. **Venezuela/Guyana You will have seen that last night we issued astatementon Venezuela [and Guyana] in which the Secretary-General said he is following with concern the recent escalation of tension between Guyana and Venezuela over the border controversy between the two countries. The Secretary-General said that he trusts that both parties will demonstrate good faith and avoid any action that would aggravate or extend the controversy, which is now before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, in the Netherlands. **South Sudan You heard, I think, an update from Sudan and all the horrific things that are going on there. Just to flag that, to the south, in South Sudan, our [Acting] Humanitarian Coordinator, Marie-Helene Verney, today condemned a deadly attack on humanitarian workers in the south-east of the country. On November 6th, a nutrition officer — a South Sudanese national working for an international NGO — was killed while responding to a suspected measles outbreak in the Greater Pibor Administrative Area. Since the beginning of the year, four aid workers have been killed in South Sudan. We never stop stressing that humanitarians are on the front lines to provide life-saving support to the most vulnerable South Sudanese. South Sudan remains the country with the highest proportion of food-insecure people globally — at 56 per cent of the population. That is an estimated 7.1 million men, women and children with malnutrition. 1.6 million of those are children. The effects of ongoing climate shocks in South Sudan are compounded by rising food and fuel prices and the lingering impact of the conflict; many families now need humanitarian assistance for the first time. And just to flag that the African Union Mission in South Sudan (AUMISS), the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and our Mission (UNMISS) issued a joint statement yesterday welcoming the recently announced presidential decrees on the commencement of the process to reconstitute South Sudan's National Constitutional Review Commission, National Elections Commission and the Political Parties' Council. These critical developments highlight key milestones in preparing for and clarifying the way forward for the country's permanent constitution-making process and its first post-independence elections, scheduled for December 2024. **Libya A couple more updates for you. From Libya, our humanitarian colleagues tell us that two months after deadly floods devastated the east of the country — impacting a quarter of a million people — international support for relief efforts there remains critical. Our $71 million flash appeal for the flood response is less than half funded, and more than 43,000 people remain displaced by the flooding — while more than 8,000 are still missing. We, along with our partners, have reached some 180,000 people with humanitarian assistance in the past two months — including food, cash assistance and shelter kits. We remain concerned over the heightened risk of infectious diseases due to damaged water and sanitation infrastructure. Water trucking continues to ensure that women, men and children have access to safe drinking water. **Nepal In Nepal, we continue to support the Government-led response one week after the devastating earthquake that hit the west part of the country. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that more than 400 aftershocks were reported this week. People have been forced to spend nights outside or in makeshift shelters in freezing temperatures. The World Food Programme has distributed 8 tons of ready-to-eat food to cover 10,000 people for three days. UN Women established two community kitchens led by a women's group. Meanwhile, UNICEF installed three medical tents and has distributed buckets, hygiene kits and mobile toilets to meet the needs of more than 20,000 people. The World Health Organization is providing technical, coordination and information management support and has provided six vehicles to assist. UNFPA has provided more than 10,000 dignity kits to women and adolescent girls. OCHA says that, given that it is winter, there is an urgent need for warm clothing, winterized shelter, health care and food support. **Myanmar And from Myanmar, we can report, thanks to our humanitarian colleagues, that intense fighting in northern Shan providence continues and has now extended to the north-west of the country. Within two weeks, some 90,000 people have been displaced in northern Shan and the region of Sagaing. Essential routes within northern Shan continue to be obstructed by checkpoints operated by both sides. Phone and internet services remain limited outside Lashio township, and the main airport has been closed since the escalation of the fighting. Provision of life-saving assistance to affected civilians — including cash, food and essential relief items — continues wherever possible. We estimate that one-third of people in need have been reached with some form of assistance so far. $1 million from the Myanmar Humanitarian Response Fund will be disbursed to respond to emerging needs in northern Shan providence. This support, however, is insufficient to meet the surge in needs. The Humanitarian Response Plan for Myanmar is currently just 28 per cent funded. Nationwide, more than 2 million people are now internally displaced and remain in urgent need of adequate shelter, food, basic services for their survival and protection. Local and international humanitarian partners remain committed to staying and delivering despite underfunding and heavy access constraints. The humanitarian community in Myanmar urges all parties to the conflict to adhere to international humanitarian law, safeguarding the lives and well-being of civilians and of course the aid workers who are trying to assist the civilians. **Food Production I just want to flag, this is the last item, that the Food and Agriculture Organization predicts a decline in international trade in some basic foodstuffs. According to its new report, FAO says that extreme weather events, rising geopolitical tensions and sudden policy changes pose risks for global food production systems and could potentially tip delicate demand-supply balances and dampen prospects for trade and global food security. The report shows that trade volumes in coarse grains and rice are expected to decline in the 2023-24 period and that world trade in vegetable oils and fats is expected to dip modestly, while global production and consumption are anticipated to expand. **Questions and Answers Spokesman: Yes, sir? Question: Thank you very much, Steph. I'm with Sky News Arabia. Well, today there seems a sliver of hope, at least to me how I see it, when you mentioned something about the kids in Gaza, that they are patient with cancer that's been... starting to be evacuated. Correct me if I'm wrong. And if there's any way...? Spokesman: Yes. You're not wrong. Question: Perfect. If there's any way to elaborate more on this? And the numbers, I believe, they are around 30 patients with cancer in Gaza. Those are definitely in terrible state health-wise. So... and it's a small number. Being able to evacuate them, this could be like, humanitarian-wise, this is a win. Can you elaborate more about what happened? Spokesman: Of course, it's a win for those children and their families who were able to accompany them to hospitals in Egypt and Jordan and further afield. But let's not forget the amount of effort and time it takes to negotiate case by case is intolerable, especially for the patients and their families. So, it is a win, but we are still working for and need a humanitarian ceasefire, so all those who can get help and all those who need to seek medical help can actually receive it. Question: Awesome. Can we have the numbers, please, Steph? The exact numbers for those kids. Spokesman: I can reread what I said. Question: Thank you. Spokesman: Again, I think I have to pay attention to what I say, you have to pay attention to what I say, but we'll reread it. Let's see, 12 children with cancer and other blood disorders were evacuated with their companions, but we hope to have more. Maggie and then Edie and then Emily. I don't think I heard you mention Al-Shifa. There was bombing at the hospital, around the hospital, today. Do you have any on-the-ground reports? Spokesman: Listen, the bombings are continuing. The fighting is continuing. That is having a direct impact on the health care system. But as I mentioned, Tedros, who will be briefing at 3:00 p.m., will have a lot more details for you. Question: The IDF says that Hamas has its command centre under Al-Shifa. So, they're tightening the noose in that area. Does the Secretary-General have a message to the IDF about Al-Shifa? Spokesman: The message to all combatants is that hospitals and civilian infrastructure should not be used in combat. Question: And just, sorry, one quick one. Spokesman: Yeah. Question: Mr. Volker Türk, you said he concluded his visit to the Middle East. So, I believe when he started it, he was seeking permission to go to Israel as well or seeking meetings... [Cross talk] Spokesman: Yeah, my understanding is that he will not be going there. Question: Were they... Did they reject his request for meetings? What's the details? [Cross talk] Spokesman: He's not going. I know he had expressed his intention to go, and he's not going. Edie and then Emily. Question: Thank you, Steph. First, does the United Nations have any indication that these four-hour humanitarian pauses announced by the White House are actually taking place? Spokesman: Well, we've seen the announcement of these pauses that were in a sense unilaterally declared. We've seen some movements of people, but I would reiterate what I said yesterday, is that we'll continue to look for a humanitarian ceasefire and for ceasefires to be coordinated, and we need to ensure that they're actually safe in order for them to be effective. Question: And is the UN being contacted by the Israeli Defense Forces about they say that they're doing this locally? Spokesman: Colleagues on the ground remain in constant contact with the relevant Israeli counterparts. Question: I have one other question. Spokesman: Please. Question: You've talked about this terrible plight of bakeries and getting flour and the other key ingredients to make bread, which is apparently keeping most of Gaza's population alive. Are there any fresh efforts, talks with officials either in Egypt or the Israelis themselves, about getting these supplies in and the bakeries reopen? Spokesman: Well, the critical supply that we're not able to get in is fuel. I mean, the fuel powers electricity plants, powers generators, it powers desalination plants, it powers pumps. Fuel powers everything that we need. So, without, you know, there is some foodstuff coming in, but without fuel, without clean water, you cannot operate a bakery. Emily and then Dezhi. Question: Thanks, Steph. A follow-up on Myanmar. You said 90,000 people displaced in two weeks. There was a press release from OCHA overnight saying 50,000 people as of 9th of November. So, I'm wondering if they got really wrong with that number or we are talking another... about something else, in terms of geographic displacement or... I mean, because the number are really, really... like, almost doubled. Spokesman: What we said is, 90,000 have been displaced in the northern regions. Again, we'll try to get some accounting details from our friends at OCHA. You know how good we are with math here. [Mumbling] No. No. You're right to ask the question. Even that I can figure out. It's a big difference. Thank you. Dezhi, then Ibtisam, then Denis, then Stefano. Question: A couple of questions on Gaza. And this afternoon, the Security Council is going to discuss the situation in Gaza. From the Secretary-General, there's not... there is no voting on any resolutions or joint statement. What do you think the message would this Security Council meeting convey into the world? Spokesman: Well, I think there are two separate things. We keep hoping and yearning for a united message from the Security Council to see an end to the conflict in Gaza. You know the process better than I. It hasn't happened. This meeting, if I'm not mistaken, was asked for by the UAE as a humanitarian briefing. It's a general occasion for the head of the World Health Organization to give, I'm sure, a very detailed description of the impact on the health care system in Gaza. Question: So, that would let everybody know what happened in Gaza? Spokesman: Statement or a question? Question: No. I'm just wondering what's the...? How to say that? Well... [Cross talk] Spokesman: I mean, the message will be carried by you. I'm just saying this is, they've asked for a humanitarian briefing. Security Council members, as they wish, are getting what they've asked for. They're getting a humanitarian briefing, which will amplify the humanitarian message and the disastrous humanitarian situation in Gaza. Question: The UN always ask for a humanitarian ceasefire? But last night, the Prime Minister Netanyahu actually said there's no ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza. Given the fact that the Israeli government didn't really consider a real ceasefire, what plan does the UN have to really... how to say that? To make a difference on the situation? Spokesman: Well, we will continue to advocate — both in public and in private — for what we think is necessary. And at the same time, we will continue to deliver whatever humanitarian aid we can under the circumstances that currently exist. Question: And one last thing, this probably is a statement; you don't need to answer this. [Cross talk] I was wondering... Just now I was wondering, when you're saying there's lack of fuel, lack of flour and everything to make hopes for those people, I was thinking, which one is worse? To be being bombed to death or to be starved...? You know. Spokesman: Again, we're here to answer questions. Denis, then Ibtisam. Question: Nowadays, it's about 100 trucks going, on average, going every day... Spokesman: Less. Less. Question: Less than 100 trucks going into Gaza every day. is the UN ready to ramp up delivering humanitarian aid if there will be such an opportunity? And how many resources does UN have? We will be ready to ramp up. The current system right now is very heavy in the sense that the trucks have to drive about two hours south to undergo a clearance process and then drive back two hours, back to Rafah. It's a very cumbersome process, as we've been saying. It would be very useful to have more entry points. But the trickle of aid that is going in is not due to our lack of ability to meet the needs. Ibtisam and then Stefano. Question: A follow-up on the aid and the trucks. So, when you go... when you say that the trucks have to go two hours south, you mean to the Israeli borders? Spokesman: To Nitzana, which is a border checkpoint between Egypt and Israel. They go through an inspection protocol. Question: By whom? Spokesman: By the Israelis and others. And then they go back to Rafah, but it's two hours up, two hours down. Question: And, I mean, you have your... you... the UN worked in other conflict regions and zones, including, for example, Syria and cross-border, et cetera. Why isn't... why can't you, instead of going all the way to the south, et cetera, why don't you have your own teams near Rafah? Who can inspect these...? [Cross talk] Spokesman: Well, it would be great if we could. All of this is negotiated amongst a number of parties. It's a system as it exists. We would like to see it made easier and in greater volume. But we are dealing with the cards that have been dealt to us, and we keep trying to change our hand, but we don't control the cards. Question: Okay. I have a follow-up on the bakeries too. Giving the fact that the Israelis actually bombed many bakeries in Gaza. Some of the major bakeries already, actually. The question is here, how many bakeries do you have still functioning there? If you... like, 20 per cent or...? Spokesman: What are the percentages of working bakeries? I'll ask. It's a good question to ask. Question: Yeah. And then on the issue of four-hour pause, the thing is, can you really call it a humanitarian pause, giving the fact that you are not able, actually, in these four hours to deliver aid? And the purpose of these four hours is actually to enforce or to make it easy for the Israeli forces to occupy North Gaza in troops and not actually delivering aid or... Spokesman: I think you did not hear me use the term ""humanitarian pause"". Spokesman: Okay. Question: So, you don't call... okay. Okay. Spokesman: Well, I try to be very careful about the words that I use, and I did not use that expression. I have a last question. According to local report, Israelis in their air strikes are using different weapons, partly new weapons. My question is here, who document from the UN side these issues, whether when it comes to weapons that are forbidden to be used internationally but still used, how do you do it like? Spokesman: We don't have any visibility on that as the fighting goes on. There will be, as I think, as in any conflict, there will be time for accountability through different mechanisms in the UN. Stefano and then Margaret Besheer. Question: Thank you, Stephane. Thank you for responding on the Paciolla case. That I asked yesterday. In your response, you said that the Secretary-General states that the United Nations cooperated to the maximum extent possible with investigation by the Italian authority into the tragic death of our colleagues, and it stands ready to provide any further assistance that it can to help shed light on the case. Does this also mean that family lawyers can contact, the full cooperation of the UN, including the mission in Colombia? Spokesman: I don't think the legal proceedings will be decided between the two of us, Stefano. I've no doubt that lawyers have been in touch with our mission if they have questions. If lawyers have questions, they should go through our legal counsel. Question: And then I have a question on Libya. There are... I asked this before, there are very disturbing video on the Internet, especially on X, on Twitter, where there are Eritrean, or at least they said that they're Eritrean, refugee that been tortured and asked a ransom from the family in Eritrea. Now to... Are you aware of that? Are these fake videos? Are real? Anything? [Cross talk] Spokesman: Let me explain this. It's hard to judge the veracity of what we see on social media, but what we do know from our own experience is that many, many migrants and refugee seekers, asylum seekers, have been going through horrendous, horrendous situation in Libya as they seek to go to Europe. Margaret Besheer, and then Tony. Question: Steph, on Thursday, the US Special Envoy David Satterfield said that Washington is working to ensure that UNRWA can replenish its fuel supplies, quote, in a secure and timely fashion. Can you give us some insights? Spokesman: I think the insights we'll be able to share with you is when it happens. There are obviously discussions that are going on. They've been going on, frankly, for quite some time. Question: Are you hopeful that there'll be a breakthrough soon then? Spokesman: I mean, we need a breakthrough soon. Let me put it that way. Question: And he also said that two pipelines from Israel had been turned back on, water pipelines, into the south. Is that your understanding? Spokesman: I'll check. We have been getting reports of some water pipelines being turned on for some time, but we'll check with our UNRWA colleagues. Tony? Recently, SG stated clearly in his statements that Rafah crossing is no longer enough for the trucks to be, like, what... the number needed to be entering Gaza. My question is, and Lazzarini as well mentioned, like, he asked for the opening of Kerem Shalom as well. Is the UN doing anything, and on this front is there anything...? [Cross talk] Spokesman: We don't have keys to these gates. Right? We don't control these checkpoints. So, all we can do is try to advocate for it very publicly. As well as privately. Ibtisam, and then I'll go get our guest. Question: Just a quick follow-up on that. I mean, what the Israelis are telling you why they don't want to open Karm Abu Salem? Because this would be even cheaper for you and easier. And before the October 7th, if I'm not mistaken, I'm not sure about that, but most of the delivery and trucks were going through that crossing. Spokesman: I don't disagree with anything you said. But I think you have to ask... I said this before. I can only speak for us and not for anyone else. Yes. And then really will go to Matthias, who's been very patient in the back. Question: Thank you very much. I'll make it quick. There is an Italian initiative that was, like, floated days ago about, like, hospital ship that could be next to the Gazan coast. Do you have any information about this? [Cross talk] We haven't heard the details. Spokesman: I've seen those reports. Obviously, any of those initiatives would entail creating areas that are... which, whose safety... areas whose safety are guaranteed by everyone who's involved in this fighting. Matthias, please.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'nigeria', 'nigeria', 'philippines', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'southafrica', 'southafrica', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'jordan', 'jordan', 'jordan', 'not found', 'venezuela', 'venezuela', 'venezuela', 'guyana', 'netherlands', 'netherlands', 'sudan', 'southsudan', 'southsudan', 'southsudan', 'southsudan', 'southsudan', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'nepal', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'syria', 'colombia', 'eritrea', 'us', 'italy', 'iran']",us,True,False

It has no fence surrounding it, neither was there a gate to dissuade intruders.Without ceilings, the corrugated roofing sheets unleashed heat on the pupils and their teachers. Their only solace was the ventilation from the open squares reserved for windows.The school,Sunday PUNCHlearnt, was established by the late Olabisi Onabanjo to provide free education for Kori residents in 1982. The initiative was said to have been halted when the free education was discontinued.But in 2016, the school was revived in response to the yearnings by several communities located far from Owode and Ofada but in dire need of a secondary school that would be closer to them.Several years after the school was revived, its stakeholders lament the lack of funding, inadequate teachers and dilapidated infrastructure, among other challenges the school is confronted with.With a population of over 100 students, Kori High School has seven teachers, each of whom are compelled to take four subjects. Each classroom is shared by two classes.Most of the teachers, it was learnt, left due to poor remuneration as the school relies on donations from members of the community. In spite of its reliance on donations from individuals, non-governmental organisations, and corps members who provided books and writing materials, the school lacks a library, laboratories, a sick bay, water supply, and toilet facilities.On Wednesday morning, when our correspondent visited the school, key community leaders had formed a committee and held a meeting to seek assistance to ensure the continued running of the school.Speaking toSunday PUNCH, the chairman of the committee, Dipeolu Olanrewaju, stated, “We came together in 2016 to revive this school because we wanted our children in the communities here to have access to education. We went to the Local Government Area office and they gave us a list of what we must have, but we don’t have the means and the future of our children is at stake.“The school is still in need of more classrooms, laboratories, toilets, and a borehole for water supply. We once had someone who promised to give us a library but we have been calling him. He explained to us that with the economic situation in the country, we would need to exercise some patience.“We the parents have been struggling to pay the teachers. One kind-hearted individual took this up, and for six months he was paying the teachers N25,000. We want the government to help by supporting and maintaining this school. We are elders already, most of us only have menial jobs and there is a limit to the financial aid we can provide.”One of the letters written by the school to the state Ministry of Education was sighted by our correspondent. Titled ‘Re: Application/Presentation of Kori Comprehensive High School to the Ministry for absorption consideration’ and dated November 25, 2019 partly read, “We write your authority to please earnestly come to the aid of the school, lifting the hands of the entire Kori community in their struggle and sincere effort to ensure that realising their dreams and our efforts so far will not be dashed by the prevailing financial crisis which has slowed down financing the school.”While lamenting the dilemma of physical distance faced by pupils, one of the chiefs in the community, Muyideen Balogun, stated, “Before you find another secondary school in this area, you have to travel far to Owode Egba. The nearest secondary school is at Ofada and it is still far away. Going to and from Ofada is now N1,200. Who can afford that?“Many children in Kori communities can’t attend these two other schools due to the physical distance. Even at that, transporting children here is really expensive. This high school is the only school that is near that children from smaller communities and villages here attend and this is why we don’t want this school to shut down again. We need support.Even the two other secondary schools can’t take more students because they already have too many. The population is large but only a few secondary schools are available, yet education is a priority. We want our children to be educated in order to have a good future.”Another member of the school committee, Lateef Lawal, lamented the anxiety and panic often expressed by parents whose children are exposed to the dangers of kidnapping on the highway.Related NewsGovernorship Election Live UpdatesScientists find clitorises on female snakesCourt frees pupils in detention after PUNCH reportFlooded classrooms sack Ogun pupils, community seeks help“This highway is not a very busy place. There have been many reports of kidnapping and violent killings on the road, so we had to contribute to hire vigilantes to guard the students and secure this place. This place has no fence or any structure of protection,” he said.Exposure to reptilesAside from the anxiety generated by the insecurity, teachers and pupils of the school also have to contend with reptiles that stroll into the building freely during classes.The school’s acting Principal, Mrs Motunrayo Ogunye, lamented, “We have killed many snakes here but we have been fortunate that no student has been bitten. This place is surrounded by bushes and snakes slither into the classrooms, causing panic among our students most of the time.“We don’t have toilets in the school. Students have to go into the bushes to relieve themselves and they come across snakes there too. They are also distracted by lizards that move across the walls due to the lack of ceilings.”Ogunye also lamented the shortage of classrooms, adding that students were often drenched whenever it rained.She added, “The classrooms are not conducive during hot weather, and whenever it rains, they are drenched due to the leaking roofs and absence of windows. Our teachers are underpaid because the school is being funded by members of the community. Due to this, most teachers don’t stay; they prefer to look for greener pastures. We know the government is really trying, but we need more support from individuals, corporate bodies and NGOs.”In an interaction with some of the students, an SS3 student, Samsondeen Adesanya, told our correspondent, “If any of us is ill, we don’t have a sick bay and the classrooms are not conducive. There is no place to rest or be treated.”A teacher, Mrs Mariam Amadasun, who joined the school in 2019, noted, “We have so many challenges in this school. Most of the time when we want to answer the call of nature, we have to station a female colleague to keep an eye on us because it’s unsafe. Sometimes, we get to school late because we have to wait for more than an hour before getting a vehicle.”Quality education impededA volunteer teacher who joined the school in 2021, Mrs Elizabeth Olasupo, toldSunday PUNCHthat the lack of science laboratories had negatively affected the quality of learning.Olasupo stated, “I joined the school when my husband relocated here and began working in the school as a volunteer.

""The situation is dire, and the extent of the human impact of the floods is rearing its ugly face. We are calling for the Somalis in the diaspora and the international community to urgently respond to the situation before it turns into bigger humanitarian catastrophe,"" the head of the National Disaster Management Agency, Mohamed Mo'alim Abdulle told VOA Somali on Thursday. He said the flooding has killed 29 people and forced more than 300,000 to flee their homes in the southern and central regions of Somalia. Worst-hit regions Somali authorities say the worst-hit areas are in the Southwest and Jubbaland states. In Baidoa, about 225 kilometers southwest of Mogadishu, residents continue to stay in the open as the flooding water left their homes completely under water. ""We have been spending [our time] outside in the open for a week. We have no shelter, food and all our belongings and our house are under water,"" Madey Osman, a father of seven, told VOA Somali. ""I have nowhere to go; there is no guarantee that I will receive aid if I run to another place. We have decided to wait our fate here,"" said Markabo Malaq, a single mother raising eight children. Abdulkadir Ali Mohamed, chairperson of the regional state agency for internally displaced people affairs, said the flooding has also affected IDP camps in the outskirts of the town, which was already hosting hundreds of people displaced by an Islamist insurgency and the worst drought in the country in four decades. ""We have seen traumatized families fleeing for a third time with no hope on the horizon,"" said Mohamed. Mohamed Hussien Hassan, former regional justice minister, is concerned the circumstances will lead to the spread of diseases or worse. ""When people have no shelters, and the drinking water and the entire environment is contaminated with human waste from the local poor sewage system and the latrines, you only expect the spread of diseases like cholera and malaria,"" said Hassan. ""When people cannot work or harvest, you only expect hunger and malnutrition which can eventually degenerate into famine,"" he added. ""We fear that this situation turns into shocking humanitarian disaster."" Baidoa was once nicknamed ""the City of Death."" It earned the title in 1992 when war and famine claimed the lives of more than 220,000 people, many left dying in the streets. The city is also known for the 1993 visit by former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who committed the U.S. military to a mission that saved thousands of innocents from death during Operation Restore Hope. Meanwhile, according to local officials, in the southern Somali state of Jubbaland, there is no access to tens of thousands of families trapped by flood waters. ""The flooding has destroyed bridges and roads and cut the entire access to more than 70,000 families. There is a big fear of [a] humanitarian catastrophe,"" the president of the state, Ahmed Mohamed Islam, better known as ""Madobe,"" warned. ""Several nights of heavy rainfall compounded major flooding in Bardhere and Luuq, towns in the Gedo region, leaving hundreds of thousands of people completely under water,"" said Gedo Deputy Governor Mohamed Hussein Al-Qadi. ""Most of the areas are only accessible with boats, and we have no capacity to airlift aid or carry out rescue mission[s], which means the needy, trapped families will remain helpless, until the land dries and they are able to move [on] their own,"" said Al-Qadi. Large parts of both the Southwest and Jubbaland states are under control of al-Shabab militants, which makes it difficult for the government and aid agencies to reach those in need. On Thursday, heavy floods swept the streets of the country's capital, Mogadishu. Photos and videos shared on social media showed women, children, old people, and even motorized three-wheeled rickshaws swept away by floodwaters. ""In more than 14 years, I have lived in Mogadishu and through history; I have never seen or heard of floods of such extent in Mogadishu,"" Osman Mohamud, one of the city's residents told VOA. The United Nations has described the flooding in Somalia and neighboring countries as a ""once-in-a-century event."" Around 1.6 million people in Somalia could be affected by the heavy seasonal downpours, which have worsened by the combined impact of two climate phenomena, El Niño and the Indian Ocean Dipole, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement late Thursday.","['somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'us', 'us']",us,True,False

The storm hit in the early hours of Monday and brought strong winds and heavy rain. Weather warnings were in place but have since been lifted by the Met Office. Warnings in the Republic of Ireland - including a rare red warning, the highest level - have also ended. In Northern Ireland, about 2,000 customers were without power, mainly in Craigavon, Newry and Downpatrick, according to electricity grid operator NIE Networks. Some areas were expected to experience up to 40mm (1.7in) of rainfall within a six-hour period. As of 09:00 GMT there had been 22mm (0.87in) at Glennane in County Armagh - the most in any single area. The fastest wind gust recorded in Northern Ireland by 09:00 was 73mph (113km/h) at Killowen in County Down. Some roads have been closed in Ballymena due to fallen trees and Stormont's Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said there were reports of a landslip on the A2 Coast Road in Glenarm, County Antrim. The A22 Killyleagh Road in Downpatrick was also closed at Quoile Bridge due to damage caused by the storm. The DfI said early examinations suggested a masonry parapet has been damaged by a vehicle and the road will remain closed until a full assessment is complete. Public transport provider Translink said there were delays on the bus and train network and the bus station in Lisburn had been closed. Some roads were flooded and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) shared a picture of a crash on the M1 near junction 14, adding that nobody had been injured. Newry, Mourne and Down District Council said many of its services were disrupted due to the amber warning in the area. Household bin collections are delayed and the district's five parks are closed until further notice. County Galway in the Republic of Ireland was one of the areas worst hit by Storm Debi, with severe flooding in some parts. Ronan Henningan, from Clarinbridge in the county, said that ""everything"" in the supermarket he owns would have to be replaced. He estimated that the cost of repairing the damage could be up to €1m (£871,9400). At 04:36 local time, a member of his staff rang him to say that water was getting into the shop. The employee called back six minutes later to say that the water was up to his chest. ""It moved everything - it moved ovens that are floor-to-ceiling ovens that had to be brought in on a big huge truck,"" Mr Henningan told the BBC's Evening Extra programme. ""It was so just so powerful it moved everything, it knocked down walls."" He said that his community was devastated and he called on the Irish government to offer financial help to those affected by the floods. Irish weather service Met Éireann said a gust of 115km/h (71mph) was recorded at a weather station in Athenry, County Galway, on Monday morning. Galway City Tribune editor Enda Cunningham said that while Galway city was calm by late-morning the clean-up would be extensive. ""There are 30 cars at Seapoint car park and Salthill car park and they're destroyed,"" he said. ""I have never heard the wind that woke me at 04:20 this morning - and I've lost count of how many storms I have covered."" About 34,000 homes and businesses in the Republic of Ireland are still without power after the strong winds. Network operator ESB said work to restore power would continue but some properties would remain without supply overnight. ""The main areas in which customers will remain without supply overnight include Athlone, Cavan, Drogheda, Dundalk, Longford, Mullingar and Tuam,"" said ESB. Irish postal service An Post said a postwoman in County Limerick was taken to hospital after being hit by flying debris due to the storm. ""Thankfully she was not seriously injured,"" said An Post. Some flights at in and out of Dublin Airport were cancelled or delayed and speed restrictions were placed on some Irish rail trains, although those have since been lifted.","['unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'ireland', 'ireland', 'ireland', 'ireland', 'ireland', 'ireland', 'ireland', 'ireland', 'ireland', 'ireland', 'ireland', 'not found']",gb,True,False

Maddy, 32, fell seriously ill after using an unlicensed version of semaglutide - the active ingredient in Ozempic - from Instagram. A BBC investigation found unregulated sellers offering semaglutide as a medicine, without prescription, online. It also found the drug being offered in beauty salons in Manchester and Liverpool. Doctors say drugs bought from unregulated sources are dangerous and could contain potentially toxic ingredients. Demand for Ozempic, a prescribed type 2 diabetes medication, spiralled last year after it hit the headlines for being Hollywood's secret weight loss drug - nicknamed the skinny jab. The drug works by lowering blood-sugar levels and slowing down food leaving the stomach. Its soaring popularity led to a rise in off-label prescriptions for weight loss, which triggered global supply issues and created a shortage for diabetes patients in the UK. As pharmacies across the UK struggled to get hold of the medication, an illicit black market selling semaglutide ""diet kits"" began to flourish online. Delivered by post, these usually contain needles and two vials - one containing a white powder and the other a liquid - which have to be mixed together before the drug can be injected. That's what came through Maddy's letterbox after she searched for a ""quick fix"" on Instagram to help her lose weight ahead of an event. ""I struggle in general with losing weight. I'm just not one of those people that can shift it easily,"" she says. Maddy came across The Lip King, a company run by Jordan Parke. The Lip King's Instagram feed was flooded with before-and-after transformation photos of women with newly slimmed physiques and screenshots of text messages from customers raving about his product. Maddy wanted in. After a brief message exchange with Mr Parke and a £200 bank transfer, Maddy was sold 10mg of semaglutide with no questions asked. She also received a video from him on WhatsApp instructing her how to mix and inject the drug, along with dangerous guidance advising her to take a higher dose than what health officials would recommend. After her first injection, Maddy was instantly ""extremely ill, bed-bound, vomiting"". She says Mr Parke told her over text that vomiting was normal and to take anti-sickness tablets. A few weeks later, when the nausea had passed, Maddy tried the drug again - this time before bed. ""I was woken up by the vomiting,"" Maddy says. ""It was bad. I was throwing up all night, to the point where I was throwing up stomach acid, blood, white foam."" She went to A&E the following afternoon, where she was put on a drip. ""I can be a bit of a drama queen, but I thought I was dying. I was literally crunched over, bawling my eyes out to my mum. I was so angry, as well, because I was like, no-one told me that this was going to be a side effect,"" she says. ""I did my own research, but I didn't see anywhere that anyone was suffering to this level."" The BBC made several attempts to contact Mr Parke, but he did not respond. Mr Parke is one of many illicit sellers peddling semaglutide through social media. To find out what is actually in the drugs, the BBC bought unlicensed semaglutide from several sellers and had them tested in the lab. The results showed inconsistencies in what was in each sample. Although most of the products contained semaglutide, vials from two different sellers had no semaglutide in them at all, and nearly all of them, including the one bought from the Lip King, did not contain the full dose that had been paid for. Ozempic is available on the NHS strictly for type 2 diabetes patients. Wegovy, another semaglutide drug prescribed specifically to treat obesity, will be offered on the NHS to those with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35, and exceptionally, some people with a BMI of 30 and a weight-related health problem. Under UK law, it is illegal to sell semaglutide as a medicine without a prescription. Drugs manufacturer Novo Nordisk is the only company approved to sell and market semaglutide, branded as Ozempic and Wegovy, in the UK, but it is now battling against knock-off online sales. The firm says it is working with a third party to ""proactively identify and remove websites, ads or social-media accounts selling counterfeit semaglutide"", and has been carrying out ""in-depth investigations into copyright infringement, criminal networks and sellers illegally diverting our products"". But the BBC has discovered sellers that are closed down one day usually return the next under a new name. Online sellers attempt to get around the law by placing ""not fit for human consumption"" or ""for research purposes only"" on their product. Gerard Hanratty, a public law expert, says: ""You can put lots of different things on a label. It doesn't mean to say that it is then legal and you are compliant with the regulations."" He says sellers would need to be able to prove they are supplying the product for research purposes and not for human use in order for the warnings to be valid. A BBC Three documentary The Skinny Jab Uncovered found the unapproved versions of the drug advertised in beauty salons on British high streets. Undercover investigators visited four salons in Manchester and Liverpool and received dangerous advice about mixing and dosages in some about how to use the drug. In one salon, a reporter was told: ""Well, if you have too much, you just wouldn't want to eat anything, and you might feel sick. It's not going to be dangerous."" The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it has received reports of people ending up in hospital after using fake Ozempic pens, which are also flooding the market, with more than 300 seized since January. Prof Barbara McGowan, a consultant endocrinologist who co-authored a Novo Nordisk-funded study which trialled semaglutide to treat obesity, says licensed medications - like Ozempic and Wegovy - go through ""very strict"" quality controls before they are approved for use. She warns that buyers using semaglutide sourced outside the legal supply chain ""could be injecting anything"". ""We don't know what the excipients are - that is the other ingredients, which come with the medication, which could be potentially toxic and harmful, [or] cause an anaphylactic reaction, allergies and I guess at worse, significant health problems and perhaps even death,"" she says. Prof McGowan says that drugs like semaglutide can cause ""significant side effects"", such as nausea, for some patients, which is why proper medical support is needed. ""The important thing to understand is not just about the prescription. It's about... all the wraparound care that one gets from senior health-care professionals,"" she adds. Dale Dennis, a personal trainer from East Yorkshire, sells 10mg vials of the unofficial drug and pre-mixed pens. Mr Dennis sells the unlicensed drug on social media, encouraging buyers to message him on WhatsApp to place an order. His company, Raw Peptides Limited, is listed as a business involved in the sale of ""new cars and light motor vehicles"". The BBC contacted Mr Dennis for comment, but after initially agreeing to speak to us, he cancelled our call and sent a text using an expletive, adding: ""I definitely make your yearly salary weekly"". Dr Simon Cork, senior lecturer in physiology at Anglia Ruskin University, stresses that semaglutide is not a short-term weight loss solution and is suitable only for people with obesity. ""That might be seen as being kind of selfish, because those people quite understandably want to lose some weight, but the drug is not tested or designed to help people in that position."" He says mixing and injecting weight loss drugs at home comes with ""huge risks"". ""The vast majority of the population are not qualified or trained to administer injectable drugs themselves. And the drugs you buy if you're prescribed Wegovy or Ozempic, or one of the licensed drugs, those come in predefined amounts,"" he says. ""So you press a button and you get the correct dose of the medication. You're not drawing up an amount into a needle that you're then injecting into yourself."" The vials of semaglutide sold illegally online do not have the safeguards the official medication comes with to prevent patients from overdosing. Tilly, 22, decided to stop using semaglutide she bought on TikTok after she accidentally injected double the amount she was supposed to. ""When it came, it didn't have any instructions, which completely confused me… I messaged the company after being like 'what am I meant to do with this?' And she was like, 'well, join a Facebook group',"" she says. ""It felt like the worst hangover ever. I felt like I had a really bad headache. I felt sick, and I felt stressed about the fact that I'd taken too much,"" she says. The medicines regulator says it will use its powers to protect the public by taking ""appropriate enforcement action, including, where necessary, prosecuting those who put your health at risk"". The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's chief safety officer, Dr Alison Cave, warns that buying semaglutide from illegal suppliers ""means there are no safeguards to ensure products meet our quality and safety standards, and taking such medicines may put your health at risk"". ""If you suspect you've had an adverse reaction to semaglutide or any other medicinal product, are worried about its safety or effectiveness, or suspect it is not a genuine product, please report it to our Yellow Card scheme,"" she says.

The storm hit in the early hours of Monday and brought strong winds and heavy rain. Weather warnings were in place but have since been lifted by the Met Office. Warnings in the Republic of Ireland - including a rare red warning, the highest level - have also ended. In Northern Ireland, about 2,000 customers were without power, mainly in Craigavon, Newry and Downpatrick, according to electricity grid operator NIE Networks. Some areas were expected to experience up to 40mm (1.7in) of rainfall within a six-hour period. As of 09:00 GMT there had been 22mm (0.87in) at Glennane in County Armagh - the most in any single area. The fastest wind gust recorded in Northern Ireland by 09:00 was 73mph (113km/h) at Killowen in County Down. Some roads have been closed in Ballymena due to fallen trees and Stormont's Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said there were reports of a landslip on the A2 Coast Road in Glenarm, County Antrim. The A22 Killyleagh Road in Downpatrick was also closed at Quoile Bridge due to damage caused by the storm. The DfI said early examinations suggested a masonry parapet has been damaged by a vehicle and the road will remain closed until a full assessment is complete. Public transport provider Translink said there were delays on the bus and train network and the bus station in Lisburn had been closed. Some roads were flooded and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) shared a picture of a crash on the M1 near junction 14, adding that nobody had been injured. Newry, Mourne and Down District Council said many of its services were disrupted due to the amber warning in the area. Household bin collections are delayed and the district's five parks are closed until further notice. County Galway in the Republic of Ireland was one of the areas worst hit by Storm Debi, with severe flooding in some parts. Ronan Henningan, from Clarinbridge in the county, said that ""everything"" in the supermarket he owns would have to be replaced. He estimated that the cost of repairing the damage could be up to €1m (£871,9400). At 04:36 local time, a member of his staff rang him to say that water was getting into the shop. The employee called back six minutes later to say that the water was up to his chest. ""It moved everything - it moved ovens that are floor-to-ceiling ovens that had to be brought in on a big huge truck,"" Mr Henningan told the BBC's Evening Extra programme. ""It was so just so powerful it moved everything, it knocked down walls."" He said that his community was devastated and he called on the Irish government to offer financial help to those affected by the floods. Irish weather service Met Éireann said a gust of 115km/h (71mph) was recorded at a weather station in Athenry, County Galway, on Monday morning. Galway City Tribune editor Enda Cunningham said that while Galway city was calm by late-morning the clean-up would be extensive. ""There are 30 cars at Seapoint car park and Salthill car park and they're destroyed,"" he said. ""I have never heard the wind that woke me at 04:20 this morning - and I've lost count of how many storms I have covered."" About 34,000 homes and businesses in the Republic of Ireland are still without power after the strong winds. Network operator ESB said work to restore power would continue but some properties would remain without supply overnight. ""The main areas in which customers will remain without supply overnight include Athlone, Cavan, Drogheda, Dundalk, Longford, Mullingar and Tuam,"" said ESB. Irish postal service An Post said a postwoman in County Limerick was taken to hospital after being hit by flying debris due to the storm. ""Thankfully she was not seriously injured,"" said An Post.

The Met Office has issued cautionary alerts for Northern Ireland , Wales , north-west England , and north-east Scotland , anticipating gusts reaching up to 80mph in exposed coastal areas and 65mph inland. This disturbing weather system has already resulted in power outages and disrupted travel in several areas, with specific regions bearing the brunt of its force. Northern Ireland experienced road closures and disruptions in public transport networks, leaving around 3,000 customers without power, predominantly in Craigavon, Newry, and Downpatrick. In Wales, gusts reaching up to 77mph pounded the coastal regions following a yellow weather warning issued across various areas. The storm's severity prompted an amber warning in Counties Armagh and Down in south-west Northern Ireland and continues in parts of north-west England, including Cumbria, Lancashire, and Merseyside, suggesting a potential risk to life and property. In addition, yellow weather warnings for wind include much of northern England and Wales, impacting cities like Manchester, Sheffield, Liverpool, Bangor, and St Davids. The storm's influence extends further with a yellow warning for rain in parts of north-east Scotland, previously battered by Storm Babet, causing evacuations from flooded homes. Origin of Storm Debi Storm Debi's origins trace back to the Republic of Ireland, where red weather warnings were initially in place, resulting in significant power loss in over 100,000 homes and businesses, with the number expected to rise. The stormy conditions are forecasted to heavily impact Irish Sea coasts, leading to potential damage to buildings and disruptions in travel, including ferry cancellations and delays. The Met Office emphasized the possibility of severe weather leading to flooding, causing danger to life and disruptions across various modes of transportation, including road, rail, air, and ferry services. The warnings also highlight potential risks such as mobile phone coverage disruptions, injuries from large waves and coastal material being thrown onto properties. Storm Debi is anticipated to move into the North Sea by Monday evening, following the wake of Storm Ciarán and Babet, which brought flooding and disruptions across the Channel Islands, southern England, and Lincolnshire. While experts note the likelihood of more intense rainfall and storms due to a warming atmosphere, the precise impact of climate change on these events remains a complex and ongoing analysis for scientists. The urgency for global emission reduction remains crucial to curbing further temperature rises and mitigating the frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events. FAQs How are storms created? Storms are created when a center of low pressure develops with a system of high pressure surrounding it. This combination of opposing forces can create winds and result in the formation of storm clouds such as cumulonimbus. Why was the UK storm called Debi? The storm was officially named by Met Eireann and this is the earliest in the season that a storm in alphabetical sequence beginning with the letter 'D' has ever hit the British Isles .

""I have got to the point now where I want my flat to flood because then they will have to put me in emergency accommodation and it will get me away from here. I'm not coming back,"" she said. ""I'm fed up, depressed, it's affecting my mental health really badly."" Another person living at the development, Stuart Bridge, said he ""felt so sorry"" for the worst-affected residents. ""I have heard of people having toilets backed up and problems with sewage and all sorts of things."" A spokesperson for property developer Beal Homes said the drainage system was ""working exactly as it was designed and approved to do"". They said this included enabling ""some rainwater to back up onto the site infrastructure in the event of extreme rainfall, such as recently"". Anglian Water said the developer had ensured all pipe connections where ""foul was incorrectly piped to the surface water have been resolved"". They said the management of surface water was ""working as intended"" and had been approved by North Kesteven District Council and Lincolnshire County Council at the planning application stage. ""Unfortunately, there will sometimes be weather conditions where rain is extremely heavy or sustained, when the attenuation isn't enough,"" they said. ""When this occurs, the road on Pitsford Close will flood. This flooding, whilst inconvenient, is by design. ""The threshold levels of the property are set substantially higher than the road for this reason."" Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

Also known as Annakut, it is celebrated with enthusiasm and devotion in various parts of India. In 2023, Govardhan Puja, the fourth day of Diwali celebrations, falls on November 13th. This auspicious day is observed on the first lunar day of the Kartik month, according to the Hindu calendar. The origins of Govardhan Puja are steeped in Hindu mythology, particularly in the Bhagavata Purana. The story revolves around Lord Krishna, who is considered an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. According to the legend, the people of Vrindavan used to worship Lord Indra, the god of rain, by offering elaborate rituals and sacrifices to ensure a good harvest. Lord Krishna, however, encouraged the people to worship the Govardhan Hill, a sacred and benevolent mountain. He emphasised that the hill, which provided grazing pastures and shelter for their cattle, deserved their gratitude and devotion. In a divine display of power, Lord Krishna lifted the colossal Govardhan Hill on his little finger to shield the residents of Vrindavan from the torrential rain and flooding unleashed by an angered Lord Indra. Krishna’s act of protecting the people and livestock from the wrath of Indra showcased the superiority of devotion to nature over extravagant rituals. Gratitude to Nature: Govardhan Puja underscores the importance of respecting and protecting the environment. It serves as a reminder to acknowledge the bounties of nature and express gratitude for the resources it provides. Community Bonding: The festival promotes unity and community bonding as people come together to build and decorate a replica of the Govardhan Hill from food items. This large offering, known as the Annakut, is then distributed as prasad (blessed food) to all. Simplicity and Devotion: Govardhan Puja teaches the valuable lesson that devotion and simplicity often hold more significance than grandiose rituals. It encourages individuals to cultivate a sense of humility and connect with the divine through heartfelt devotion. On Govardhan Puja, devotees construct a hillock made of food items like rice, fruits, and sweets, representing the Govardhan Hill. The Annakut is offered to Lord Krishna, acknowledging His divine protection and the sanctity of nature. Temples are beautifully decorated, and prayers and bhajans (devotional songs) fill the air. In many regions, Govardhan Puja coincides with the Gujarati New Year and is celebrated with traditional fervor. Processions, dances, and cultural programs are organized, creating a vibrant atmosphere. Govardhan Puja in 2023 is a day to remember the importance of nature, the significance of simplicity, and the power of devotion. It’s a celebration of unity, community, and the divine grace of Lord Krishna. As devotees build the symbolic Govardhan Hill from food, they are reminded of the need to protect and honor the environment, fostering a sense of responsibility towards the world around us. The timing of Govardhan Puja, following Diwali, has a profound meaning. It signifies that after the grandeur of Diwali, with its lights and festivities, comes the moment of humility and simplicity. It serves as a reminder that while celebrations are essential, they should be balanced with gratitude and respect for nature, just as Lord Krishna emphasized when He lifted the Govardhan Hill. 📣For more lifestyle news, follow us onInstagram|Twitter|Facebookand don’t miss out on the latest updates!","['india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india']",in,True,True

Apart from food, they supply ecosystem services such as flood and stormwater mitigation, cooling and climate regulation, carbon storage, waste treatment and recreation.It could be said that the conversion of peri-urban agricultural land for urban expansion unwittingly undermines the verylife support on which city dwellers depend.Ourresearchexplores possible solutions that allow food production and housing to co-exist within peri-urban zones.The housing-agriculture conundrumIn Aotearoa New Zealand, the competition for land for either housing or food production within the peri-urban zone is intense. Local and regional councils have to attempt to mediate between two recently gazetted national policy statements that seem at odds.The 2020National Policy Statement for Urban Developmentrequires councils to remove barriers to urban expansion, both up and out. The 2022National Policy Statement on Highly Productive Landrequires councils to avoid urban encroachment and protect highly productive land for agriculture.A recent Ministry for the Environmentreportstates:""The area of highly productive land that was unavailable for agriculture (because it had a house on it) increased by 54% from 2002 to 2019.""Urban resilience and food productionPeri-urban zones have an important role in supplying locally produced food. This helps reduce transport emissions to meet New Zealand'semissions reduction targets. But there is a growing disconnect between where New Zealand's food is produced and where the majority of New Zealanders live.The dominant approach tourban growthis through greenfield development (building on undeveloped land), and this ultimately compromises the productive land belt around many cities and settlements. This can result in the irreversible loss of some of our most fertile soils.Multiple factors affect where food can be produced within the peri-urban zone. This includes policy, land value, soil versatility, natural resources such as water and, increasingly, the level of ""reverse sensitivity""—a term used to describe, in this instance, the impacts of newer land uses (such as housing) on prior activities (agriculture) in mixed-use areas.Planning policy oftenfails to keep up with changesin housing markets, agricultural practice and lifestyle choices. This then results in reactive planning approaches, putting high-value soil and other land suitable for food production at continued risk of development and fragmentation.This is compounded by public and political pressures that can lead to tensions between food producers and their residential neighbors.Combined land useOur team has surveyed households and food producers living and operating within the peri-urban zone of Ōtautahi Christchurch to better understand the issues. We also wanted to explore opportunities arising from food production and housing co-existing within peri-urban zones.Based on the views of surveyed participants, we developed five land-use design concepts, which were then evaluated by participants during a public workshop.Of these five options, a multi-functional green belt (below) was most favored. This green belt is a publicly accessible buffer between urban areas andconventional farms, including public open spaces, community gardens, sports fields, walking tracks, native plantings, stormwater management zones and playgrounds.Other scenarios included different options of either separating or integrating urban and rural land uses.What did peri-urban residents and food producers say?Our research reveals that residents like having food-producing landscapes close to where they live. More than 60% of respondents felt ""extremely positive"" and 32% ""mostly positive"" towards these landscapes.One of our key findings suggests residents were mostly happy to accept the day-to-day nuisances of farm operations, but they wanted their household to benefit by being able to access food produced locally.Food producers expressed more neutral feelings towards operating in the peri-urban zone. For them, being close to their potential customers, as well as benefiting from urban infrastructure such as high-speed internet, was important.But our survey also highlights that peri-urban residents are concerned about possible negative impacts of nearby intensive farming, and producers fear facing complaints from their urban neighbors. Both groups called for greater agricultural literacy for urban New Zealanders.Integrating people and productionHow should we prioritize peri-urban food production alongside strategic urban expansion?The loss of agricultural land tourban development, the disconnect between local farms and their urban markets, and the recent drive to create more sustainable infrastructure within and around cities, have all engendered planning and urban design programs that aim to protect and reconnect cities with their food.Redesigning peri-urban land-use patterns to integrate housing with productive land uses has the potential to connect New Zealanders with the land while mitigating the current rural-urban dichotomy approach to planning.Embedding mana whenua values of connectedness with the environment offers significant opportunities to nourish both the land and communities that reside within. The reintegration of mahinga kai (food-gathering sites) and māra kai (food gardens) principles would support the health and resilience of both people and the land connected to cities.Accessible localfoodproduction is anessential component of long-term urban resilience. To achieve this, we argue that we need a new approach to peri-urban land-use planning for Aotearoa New Zealand in which landscapes for both people and production are integrated and mutually beneficial.","['newzealand', 'newzealand', 'not found']",gb,False,False

Even after pandemic restrictionshammered the hobby, signs point to its continued growth — the industry is on track to make well over$2 billionin the US this year. We've sampled some of the year's biggest tabletop games, from quick duels to sprawling cooperative campaigns. Here are our reviews: A grip of Sapphire and Amethyst Lorcana cards.Ravensburgerhide caption A grip of Sapphire and Amethyst Lorcana cards. I'm feeling good about my chances. I started the game with the Queen from Snow White, then later played the Beast to banish an opposing Megara. Victory's only a few quests away — and maybe my alternate-world Gaston (subtitled ""Intellectual Powerhouse"") can give me the cards and beef I need to secure the win. But despite my lead, I couldn't keep pace with my opponent's tide of characters, from the Duke of Weselton to Steamboat Willie. I'm a hardenedMagic: the GatheringandAndroid: Netrunnerveteran, yet Lorcana glory somehow evades my grasp. While I've lost out as a competitor, publisher Ravensburger scored financial success with this new trading card game for kids and Disney fanatics. Debut product The First Chapter quickly sold out this fall, while the expansion, Rise of the Floodborn, is releasing just in time for the holidays. I had the chance to playtest both. In two-player games that take less than half an hour, you'll take turns conjuring Disney characters, items, and actions. You win not by attacking your opponent, but by sending characters on quests to tick your Lore points from zero to twenty. Most cards serve dual roles: you can put one face down into your ""inkwell"" each turn, which you'll use to play out increasingly expensive and powerful cards. The premise embraces a multiverse of heroes and villains, each categorized into three types. You'll see the classic ""Storyborn"" as they appear in canonical movies, while ""Dreamborn"" are slightly off the factory mold. But ""Floodborn"" characters headline the newest set and inject a modicum of whimsy into Disney's tight brand standards. Here, you'll see Cinderella as an armored knight, Belle as a woodland archer, or Cruella de Vil as a runway fashionista. Much as I enjoyed Lorcana's inventive art and the amusing ironies of, say, Dr. Facilier teaming up with Rapunzel and singing ""Part of Your World"" — the game has not entirely enchanted me. While Rise of the Floodborn reaches deeper into Disney's catalog (it's got all Seven Dwarfs!), it doesn't clarify the game's muddled identity. Trading card games often break their cards into opposing factions with different game plans, but each of Lorcana's six ""ink colors"" feel roughly equivalent. Sure, Amber cards care more about Princesses and Sapphire cards let you draw more from your deck, for instance, but they also share plenty of mechanically identical characters. Heroes and Villains aren't wholly defined by specific colors either — Mulan and Mother Gothel both have Ruby and Emerald variants, for example. Still, such grievances won't slow sales for the families the game caters to. Now more than ever, you can fill your shelves with Disney board games from storied designers: Lorcana slides right next to Disney Dixit, Disney Codenames, Disney Villainous — the list goes on. I got glimmers of a deeper game while paddling in Lorcana's shallows, but it'd take a real transformation to make it truly dazzle. — James Mastromarino, gaming lead and Here & Now producer My first game of Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West felt like embarking into the unknown. While it's based on a classic, it literally changes the rules as you go in a long campaign designed by industry veteran Rob Daviau to play over 15-20 games. Between each, you'll open sealed boxes and envelopes to find new pieces and stickers to place on the board, depending on the outcomes of the previous game. The game starts like the original Ticket to Ride, but the first twist comes early with a new rule: now, each player gets two points every time they build a route matching their player color, which fundamentally altered our strategies. Instead of taking tickets that looked easy to complete, I searched the map for unclaimed blue routes and chose tickets that conveniently overlapped. After your first game, most players will earn a postcard that gives them a secret advantage. Most aren't useful immediately and hint at future mechanics that you'll now have a leg up in. It's such an intriguing tease. After our first game, I earned a postcard from treasure hunters headed to the Sierra Madre. That wasn't a location on our board yet, but I had a feeling that when it showed up, I would have some adventuresome allies waiting to give me a hand. As the campaign chugs forward, you'll push westward. The game avoids the ugliest realities of the railroads' expansion west (the displacement of Native Americans, the exploitation of laborers, including Chinese immigrants, etc.). Instead, the game makes its ultimate villain the owner of a rival monopolist train company, which seeks to squelch all the players' friendly competition. My friends and I couldn't put this game down. There were always new twists and new challenges to compete in. If you're a fan of the original game but eventually tired of it, you should book a ticket for Legends of the West. — Vanessa McGinnis, digital campaign manager Descent's giant boxes and the dozens of miniatures contained therein.Garry Butler/Asmodeehide caption Descent's giant boxes and the dozens of miniatures contained therein. Are you a TTRPG player struggling to find someone to run a campaign? Descent: Legends of the Dark, an app-driven board game for up to four players, promises to fill the gap (should you have the budget and space for it). The base game and new expansion, The Betrayer's War, would set you back over $300, and the boxes are HUGE (12""x12""x12"" and 12""x12""x8""), so they can store 3D terrain and scores of detailed plastic miniatures. But once we got everything set up, my family and I found it fun and fast-paced. The App is gorgeous and replaces a flesh-and-blood dungeon master (it's available on iOS, Android, Mac and PC). You can sync your progress between devices and start Act Two, The Betrayers War, with an existing campaign — or view a quick summary of the previous game to jump straight into the expansion. In Act One, your party must quest to save your homeland of Terrinoth from the demon-tainted Uthuk Y'llan barbarians and the undead servants of Waiqar the Undying. The leaders of Terrinoth are divided and fractious, unable to unite against these common threats. Act Two continues the struggle with the addition of the forces of Dragonlord Levirax. While the App does an excellent job guiding you through the first scenario and teaching the rules, you also get a helpful print reference copy of the rules for reference. As you explore the realm, you're guided to assemble each encounter using the physical terrain and where to place your foes as you discover them. A handy app instructs you how to build encounters room-by-room across a massive campaign.Garry Butler/Asmodeehide caption A handy app instructs you how to build encounters room-by-room across a massive campaign. During their turn, each hero may perform up to three actions in any order: one maneuver action and two additional actions of their choice — from attacks to spells. Though you quickly fall into a rhythm of combat, it doesn't get boring. The quality cutscenes drive the story along, and each scenario lasts two to four hours. At the end of a quest, you'll return to Frostgate, a city where you'll level up, go shopping, craft items, and visit the armory. While the combination of app interactions and physical dice proved engaging, it's also very fiddly. We had to use our best judgment when the app and print-outs failed to demystify rules. We also found it challenging to match the miniatures to on-screen foes due to their small size in the app. They aren't labeled either, so having a printed guide sheet for the minis and scenarios feels like an oversight. Taken together, Descent: Legends of the Dark and The Betrayer's War boast surprising depth and replayability, whether you're flying solo or with a group. It's a colossal toybox for those who love RPG figures and sprawling 3D terrain. Is it worth the staggering asking price? If you have the tablespace and patience, absolutely. — Garry Butler, PC support technician Arrange newspaper tiles to make a perfect frontpage in Fit to Print.Vanessa McGinnis/Flatout Gameshide caption Arrange newspaper tiles to make a perfect frontpage in Fit to Print. When I heard the Prairie Courier needed a new editor, I knew I was hooked. This cozy game may as well have been made special for me, from its newspaper theme to the beautiful art of Thistleville's animal citizens. Even better, it uses one of my favorite mechanics: tile laying. This light game for up to six players takes less than half an hour to play. Each of the game's three rounds takes three to five minutes — to the second, you have to use a timer to track it! You'll rush to gather story, picture, and ad tiles. Once you're happy with the options you've piled on your cardboard desk, announce ""Layout!"" to the group and begin arranging the tiles on your newspaper board. This was my favorite part of the game, speeding to beat my friends and fit all of my articles, pictures, and ads in my newspaper. You have to balance elements to get the best score, turning your front page into a puzzle. For instance, you can't put articles of the same type beside each other and you'll want to place pictures alongside articles that have the same topic. And don't forget about the integrity of your paper; if you publish too many happy or sad stories, you'll lose points for being biased! Fit to Print is a charming little game perfect for families. I can't wait to take it home for the holidays and race my little siblings to be the first paper off the press! — Vanessa McGinnis, digital campaign manager Save the world from Marvel villains in D.A.G.G.E.R (which stands for Defense Alliance for Global and Galactic Emergency Response, by the way).Vanessa McGinnis/Asmodeehide caption Save the world from Marvel villains in D.A.G.G.E.R (which stands for Defense Alliance for Global and Galactic Emergency Response, by the way). Every turn in the cooperative Marvel D.A.G.G.E.R. had me on the edge of my seat, unsure if my friends and I would make it to the next round. Over two hours, our superheroes sprinted around the world, throwing punches at minions and defying a villain's schemes in a race against the clock — and we didn't always succeed. In our first game, Loki unexpectedly teleported to and killed She-Hulk in New York. Unable to do anything to stop it, my fiancé sadly returned her to the box. Luckily, character death doesn't eliminate players, so the next turn, he pulled out Hulk and announced that She-Hulk's cousin Bruce was here to finish what she'd started! We ended up carrying the day, but not before I accidentally got Black Widow killed. This game for up to five players really shines when you're sharing ideas to use your turns as efficiently as possible. In one game, I had to split my actions between fighting Taskmaster as Black Panther Shuri and rushing back to New York to meet Spider-Man and Elektra for dinner at Aunt May's house so Spider-Man could get his upgrade card. If you're looking for a cooperative challenge with your friends, this globetrotting nail-biter is worth a try – just look out for Loki's illusions! — Vanessa McGinnis, digital campaign manager","['us', 'turkey', 'turkey', 'turkey', 'france', 'not found', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",us,True,True

For those closely observing the horrific developments unfolding day after day in that thin strip of land, some names have become far more than those belonging to bearers of “news” — Wael Al-Dahdouh, Plestia Alaqad, Motaz Azaiza. When 22-year-old Plestia’s Instagram handle — where she has regularly been posting her reportage and updates — went silent for three days because she had lost internet connectivity, panicked followers flooded her comment sections asking if she was alright, if she was still alive. Wael, Al Jazeera’s Gaza Chief of Bureau, was live on air when his wife, son, daughter and 18-month-old grandson were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Cameras were trained on him at the hospital when he saw and held their lifeless bodies. Less than 24 hours later, he was back on air, saying, “I saw that it was my duty, despite the pain and the bleeding wound, to return in front of the camera and communicate with you on social media as soon as possible.” In ways that they would have never wished for, they are as much subjects of their own reportage as the rest of Gaza. And as they bring to us image after image, update after update of death and despair, they don’t just want to inform us of the magnitude of suffering. They also hope that something in these images and updates will move something, will help halt the juggernaut of destruction so that their families and friends may live. These are not just facts for our information presented by professionals, these are also cries for help by civilians. There are no foreign journalists in Gaza. Their own phones, cameras and voices are all they have and they have been valiantly pushing against staggeringly difficult odds to push out their images and words. When they are so brave, who are the rest of us to feel cynical or dejected? But our social media feeds are flooded with images shot by them and the ordinary citizens of Gaza — bloodied pieces of bread, men comforting traumatised children, women kissing the bodies of their dead infants. We watch many of them, are deeply moved by some, scroll past many more. As a journalist, who has been consuming these images for more than a month now, I feel my faith in what our work is supposed to achieve is deeply shaken. Maybe not all journalists are motivated by a sense of justice but I am willing to believe that most of us believe in the importance of bearing witness. After everything else is stripped away, that is what lies at the heart of any kind of reporting. And a belief that this act of bearing witness makes some kind of difference. The brave journalists of Gaza bear witness very differently, in the hope that what they lay before the world will pierce through the fog and help save their home and people. And the world indeed is their witness, yet the equivocation and bombardment continue. At this peak of human tragedy, has any ideal of the power of testament crumpled? But they continue through grief, fear and the spectre of death to bear witness for a world that watches as everything they know is destroyed. Through this heartbreaking display of courage, the most moving image for me was when it wavered to lay bare what has been suppressed — when journalist Salman Al-Bashir pulled off his blue press helmet and jacket, breaking down while reporting on the killing of his colleague Mohammed Abu Hatab: “No one is seeing us or the size of this catastrophe and the crime we are experiencing in Gaza… We are victims, directly on live television. We are losing souls one after the other… We are martyred victims in a matter of time, we wait our turn, one after the other.” sukrita.baruah@expressindia.com","['palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories']",in,False,False

Govardhan Puja Pratahkala Muhurat - November 14, 2023. Significance Of Govardhan Puja According to the Bhagavata Purana , Lord Krishna once lifted the Govardhana Hill to protect the inhabitants of Vrindavan from torrential rains sent by Lord Indra, the rain deity. Shri Krishna is believed to have dissuaded the cowherds of Govardhan not to worship any other deities than the Purna Parmatma . This infuriated Indra and he sent heavy rains and hailstorms for seven to eight days. Krishna lifted the hill and shielded the people from the downpour. Rituals: On this day, many Krishna devotees pay a visit to Braj , a pilgrimage site in Mathura. They circumambulate the hill and offer food to the mountain. Some may perform dandavats or full-body prostrations in front of the hill.

""But we cannot continue overdrafting the region's most important source of fresh water.""To do so, he said, risks a potential takeover bystate officials. That's because state law requires that local agencies bring groundwater aquifers into balanced levels of pumping and recharge.The amount of water currently flowing into the valley's underground basin is 7,650 acre-feet a year. Annual usage is about 28,000 acre-feet. Eight wells have gone dry in the past year, and about 800 are at risk, officials said.But this is no classic stop-the-overdraft battle.The Indian Wells Valley aquifer lies under a point in the eastern Sierra Nevada range landscape where the corners of San Bernardino, Kern and Inyo counties meet.In 2019, the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, which generates $36 million in state and local taxes and represents a large portion of the local economy, said its top concerns include encroachment on groundwater, suggesting that shortages of its sole source of potable water could force it to shut down and move away.""Without the base, there's no Ridgecrest,"" Lemieux said. ""We have to have more water.""Draining the aquifer would also sink Ridgecrest's hopes of a bustling future of new homes, restaurants, and businesses for the 5,900 scientists, engineers and contractors employed at China Lake, which is undergoing about $4 billion worth of upgrades prompted by the 6.4. 5.4 and 7.1 magnitude quakes that rocked the area in 2019.""I don't see Ridgecrest turning into the next Las Vegas or Victorville, but it could benefit from some additional development,"" said Carol Thomas-Keefer, general manager of the groundwater authority.""More importantly,"" she said, ""the pipeline is a solution to a chronic problem: Wells are going dry because folks are tapping the aquifer's supply offresh waterfaster than it is being returned to the basin naturally by rain and snowmelt off the Eastern Sierra Nevada range.""That kind of talk has prompted Searles Valley Minerals, in the community of Trona, and Mojave Pistachios, a tree nut company on the west side of Ridgecrest, to rise up in a fury, declaring the proposed pipeline is part of a groundwater sustainability plan that forces them to bear an allegedly unfair and illegal economic burden that threatens their continued existence.""It's a pipe dream—one so bizarre it's almost laughable,"" said Amy M. Steinfeld, an attorney representing Mojave Pistachios, whose 210,000 trees materialized like a green oasis about a decade ago across 1,600 acres of scorched desert.""They've completely ignored numerous alternatives that would meet their goals while substantially decreasing the financial costs and environmental impacts,"" she said.Tensions have already flared over an aquifer ""replenishment fee"" of $2,130 per acre-foot imposed on a select few users by the groundwater authority in 2021. That increased the water costs for Mojave Pistachios and Searles Valley Minerals by as much as $6 million per year.The China Lake base, one of the largest users of water in the valley, has federal reserve water rights that make it exempt from the replenishment fee and pipeline costs passed on to ratepayers.""This fee is like saying everyone has a right to drive a Lamborghini—if they can afford one,"" gruffed Joshua Nugent, a spokesman for Mojave Pistachios.Claiming that it deprives them of their water rights and could put them out of business, both Mojave Pistachios and Searles Minerals are defying an order to pay the fees or cease pumping. The water district in Indian Wells Valley is also being charged but is making its payment under protest.Their cases, which are being heard in Orange County Superior Court to avoid claims of bias, have the potential to be landmark litigation as new groundwater regulators throughout the state consider how best to implement the state Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014.The battle has spawned a good bit of anxiety in Trona, a withering town of 1,500 residents in a wind-swept bowl hugged by three rugged mountain ranges that relies on groundwater supplied by Searles Valley Minerals.Searles officials say the authority's decision to single it out with the hefty replenishment fee, along with proposed rate increases related to the pipeline, could push the company out of business after more than 140 years of operation, putting its 700 employees out of work and turning Trona into a historical footnote.""With no Searles, there's no Trona,"" said Regina Troglin, 35, a resident and freelance architectural designer.""Just because Ridgecrest wants to grow doesn't mean it has the right to kill off Trona,"" she said. ""If the authority and Ridgecrest were serious about sustaining groundwater, they'd be pushing for storm water recovery, greywater recycling systems, and lawn removals.""The pipeline plan has also sparked challenges from environmentalists and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.That's because it would cut a zigzag path from a starting point at the Antelope Valley-East Kern Water Agency feeder pipeline in California City through historical habitat for wildlife including mountain lions, state and federally threatened desert tortoises and state threatened Mojave ground squirrels, chubby rodents with big eyes that advocates like to say resemble ""happy little Buddhas.""A particular concern is hybridization with round-tailed squirrels, which use disturbed areas as population expansion opportunities and have been moving westward from the Barstow area.High on a bluff overlooking Indian Wells Valley, Ileene Anderson, a senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, gazed out over the bone-dry desert valley born of seismic upheavals, flash floods, drought and heat.""It'll be a tough fight, but we're not going away—there are a lot of unanswered questions regarding the pipeline's impacts on wildlife and plants,"" she said. ""We're not convinced that importation of water over long distances is even sustainable over the long term under climate change scenarios for California.""That debate took a surprising turn in August when tropical storm Hilary triggeredflash floodsthat washed out county roads in the proposed site of three booster pump stations necessary to pushwaterin the pipeline over the El Paso Mountains.But backers of the pipeline said flood risks go with the territory, especially in arid mountainous regions, and could be resolved through mitigation.""We'll just put the pipeline a little deeper in the ground,"" said Don Strand, Ridgecrest city manager.A more pressing question, he said, is whether proponents can secure funding for the controversial proposal.""If we can't afford the pipeline, we have a big problem,"" he said.2023 Los Angeles Times.

Heres what you … [+6412 chars]",Mexico,"Later this week, SpaceX is poised for a highly anticipated, and undoubtedly exciting, second test flight of its Starship megarocket—provided it receives the final regulatory approvals. Here’s what you need to know about this critically important test. The Elon Musk-led company is targeting Friday, November 17 for the second test flight of its Starship megarocket—pending the final go-ahead from regulatory bodies. The upcoming flight follows the first test on April 20, which ended with the rocket’s destruction over the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, SpaceX has undertaken 63 corrective actions as mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Standing 400 feet (122 meters) tall, Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built. The megarocket is crucial for SpaceX as it’s central to the company’s goals for more ambitious space missions, including potential trips to Mars. For NASA’s Artemis Moon program and the broader spaceflight community, Starship promises a revolutionary leap, as the rocket will allow for more flexible and cost-effective missions to space. The first test flight revealed many key areas for improvement; the rocket needed “well over a thousand” changes prior to the second mission, Musk said in June. First and foremost, the lack of protective infrastructure at the Boca Chica launch mount proved to be a significant oversight. The force of the 33 Raptor engines, along with an achingly long 8-second firing sequence, shredded the area beneath the launch mount, sending debris and dust into the surrounding areas. In response, SpaceX constructed a water-cooled steel flame deflector to prevent a recurrence. The newly implemented water deluge system is being scrutinized by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and the FAA for potential environmental impacts; this represents the final regulatory hurdle for SpaceX. The fact that SpaceX has chosen November 17 as the tentative launch date implies that the company expects to receive the necessary launch license soon. Or it could be a way to pressure the regulators into issuing the license. Another area of focus is the rocket’s self-destruct mechanism. During the first test, the rocket failed to respond immediately to the self-destruct command, leading to a dangerous delay. SpaceX has since refined this system to ensure a more rapid response. A crucial technical advancement for the upcoming flight is the implementation of a hot-stage separation system. This system involves igniting the Starship upper stage prior to the separation from the lower stage, ensuring a smoother transition during ascent (stage separation did not go as planned during the inaugural flight, contributing to the rocket entering into a fatal tumble). Additionally, a new electronic Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system has been implemented for the Super Heavy Raptor engines. The process of loading the propellants—liquid oxygen and liquid methane—will commence 1 hour and 37 minutes prior to launch. As the countdown progresses at the south Texas Starbase facility, the Raptor engines on both the Super Heavy booster and Starship will undergo a pre-launch procedure known as an engine chill, commencing at T-minus 19 minutes and 40 seconds. This process is crucial for conditioning the engines to handle the super-cold propellants during ignition and flight. The flame deflector will kick in at T-minus 10 seconds, with the Raptor ignition sequence beginning at T-minus 3 seconds—a modification from the previous T-minus 8 seconds. This change aims to minimize potential damage to the launch infrastructure caused by the engines’ intense power. Two seconds after the mission begins, the rocket will lift off the pad, marking the start of its ascent. Max Q, the point of maximum aerodynamic pressure, is expected to occur 52 seconds into the mission. This phase challenges the structural integrity of the rocket as it travels through the atmosphere at increasing speeds. At 2 minutes and 30 seconds into the flight, an event termed MECO, or Most Engines Cut Off, will occur. This is a variation of the traditional Main Engine Cut Off, signifying the point when, presumably, a majority of the Raptor engines will shut down. Following this, at 2 minutes and 53 seconds, the booster will initiate its boostback burn startup. This maneuver involves a flip of the booster, setting it up for a rapid descent back to Earth. As part of this test flight, the booster will simulate a landing in the Gulf of Mexico, which is expected to happen around the seven-minute mark. This procedure is a precursor to future tests in which the booster will return to the Boca Chica site for vertical landings. The two-stage Starship is meant to be a fully reusable rocket. Meanwhile, the Starship upper stage will continue along its journey, performing an engine cut-off at 8 minutes and 33 seconds into the mission. Its path will take it over the Caribbean, southern Africa, the Indian Ocean, and New Guinea, before making a planned splashdown in the Pacific near Hawaii. A critical phase of this journey will be the reentry maneuver at 1 hour and 17 minutes, followed by a simulated ocean landing at the 90-minute mark. It’s important to note that Starship will not complete a full orbit of Earth during this mission. The success of each of these phases and stages, especially the hot staging and the reentry maneuvers, will be closely monitored, as they are crucial for the overall objectives of the test flight. Key questions include whether the 16 million pounds of thrust produced by the Raptor engines will damage the launch mount despite the water deluge system, if all 33 Raptor engines will ignite successfully, whether SpaceX will achieve hot staging on its first attempt, and if Starship can survive reentry. SpaceX will take whatever happens with its second mission, learn from it, and use those lessons to improve the third. The idea that problems will arise is practically a certainty, given the company’s devotion to “rapid iterative development,” an approach that’s “been the basis for all of SpaceX’s major innovative advancements, including Falcon, Dragon, and Starlink,” according to the company. The second Starship mission may or may not succeed, but one thing is for certain: It will not be a dull affair, for better or worse. Want to know more about Elon Musk’s space venture?

The storm's winds have now increased to near 145… [+1594 chars]",Mexico,"Hurricane Otis has made landfall on the coast of southern Mexico, bringing wind speeds of up to 165mph (270km/h). It touched down near the popular Acapulco resort just after midnight on Wednesday (06:25 GMT), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Authorities have warned of a life-threatening storm surge and the possibility of landslides as heavy rain pelts the area. The storm has already begun to weaken as it moves inland. David Hall arrived at the Princess Mundo Imperial resort in Acapulco for a work conference hours before Otis made landfall. He told the BBC that the building had been damaged by the wind and rain. He said the hotel room windows buckled from the force of the winds and smashed, sucking items out of the room. Mr Hall, who is from the Mexican city of Colima, roughly 600km (372 miles) from Acapulco, said the building ""shivered"" as if an earthquake was happening. He and hundreds of other guests at the hotel have been hunkering down together while the worst of the hurricane passes. ""A lot of people are scared,"" said Mr Hall. A hurricane warning is in effect for a 350km-long stretch of coastline between the coastal towns of Zihuatanejo and Punta Maldonado in the state of Guerrero. Power outages have already been reported in Guerrero, according to Mexico's civil protection body. School classes across the state were cancelled in preparation for the storm's arrival. Unverified videos posted online show damage to a hospital in Acapulco and flooding outside the Copacabana hotel. Mexico's national water agency said that waves of up to 10 metres high (32ft) were expected on the coasts of Guerrero and in western Oaxaca state. Possible mudslides have also been forecast. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said there was ""material damage and blocked roads"" and that there were landslides on the highway to Acapulco. He said there were no reports of deaths but cautioned that authorities were struggling to get updates. ""The hurricane is still affecting the area and communications are completely down,"" he said. Officials said that it was difficult to gauge the extent of the damage in Acapulco, which has a population of around 780,000, given poor communications. The NHC also said that Otis was expected to produce up to 20in (51cm) of rainfall on Friday across Guerrero and western coastal areas of the neighbouring Oaxaca state. Scientists said the speed with which Otis intensified from a tropical storm into a category five hurricane - the highest level of storm - on Tuesday was rare. It broke the record for the fastest intensification rate over a 12-hour period in the Eastern Pacific, gaining 80mph in that time, according to meteorologist Philip Klotzbach. Parts of Mexico's Pacific coastline have already seen significant flooding earlier this month after Tropical Storm Max hit. Local media reported two deaths as a result of the storm in Guerrero. A few days later, one man was reported killed after powerful Hurricane Lidia made landfall in the state of Nayarit, north-west of Guerrero.","['mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'brazil']",gb,False,False

Hurricane Lidia hit Mexico as a Category 4 storm, bringing wind speeds of up to 140mph (220km/h). But the storm has weakened after moving inland, with the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) downgrading it to Category 2 status. Authorities in the state of Nayarit said a man was killed when a tree fell on the van he was driving. Lidia made landfall by the small beach town of Las Penitas just before 18:00 local time (00:00 GMT). It hit as a Category 4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which goes up to five. By 21:00 (03:00 GMT), the NHC said Lidia was blowing maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) as it passed near the inland town of Mascota in Jalisco state. The centre said Lidia was moving east-northeast at 17 mph (28 km/h) and should weaken quickly as it moves over elevated terrain in west-central Mexico. ""Life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected along the path of the storm overnight,"" the NHC added, warning of dangerous water levels, flash flooding and swells on the Pacific coast. Ahead of the storm, Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced that 6,000 members of the armed forces had been deployed to help residents. ""I urge people living between Nayarit and Jalisco, especially in Bahia de Banderas, Puerto Vallarta and Tomatlan, to take precautions,"" he said on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, recommending people stay away from low-lying areas, rivers and slopes. In the seaside resort of Puerto Vallarta, residents took shelter from the storm, with shopkeepers boarding up windows and piling up sandbags in case of flooding. Earlier, the city's airport announced it was closing from 16:00 local time (22:00 GMT) until 08:00 on Wednesday. Parts of Mexico's Pacific coastline have already seen significant flooding this week after Tropical Storm Max hit. Local media reports that two people died as a result of the storm in the state of Guerrero. Hurricanes hit Mexico every year on both its Pacific and Atlantic coasts. The country's official hurricane season runs from May to November, with most storms developing between July and October. The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but scientists say that increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.","['mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico']",gb,False,False

Tens of thousands of residents in damaged homes without electricity awaited help more than a day after Otis roared ashore in Acapulco. Federal Security Secretary Rosa Icela Rodríguez said there were 27 confirmed deaths and four disappearances. Rodríguez's comments at President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s morning news briefing were echoed minutes later by Guerrero state Gov. Evelyn Salgado. López Obrador said the destruction was so complete that not a single power line pole remained standing in the impact zone. Small farmers had their corn crops devastated by Otis' wind and pounding rain, he said. Restoring power to the area was a top priority, he said. “We regret the 27 dead,” López Obrador said. The president said Wednesday night he had been told the toll was 18, but it rose early Thursday. “That's what hurts the most,” he said of the deaths, noting material losses could be replaced. López Obrador shared details of only one death: He said one soldier was among the dead after a wall of his home collapsed on him. The early images and accounts were of extensive devastation, toppled trees and power lines lying in brown floodwaters that in some areas extended for miles. The resulting destruction delayed a comprehensive response by the government, which was still assessing the damage along the coast, and made residents desperate. Many of the once sleek beachfront hotels in Acapulco looked like toothless, shattered hulks after the Category 5 storm blew out hundreds — and possibly thousands — of windows. There seemed to be a widespread frustration with authorities. While some 10,000 military troops were deployed to the area, they lacked the tools to clean tons of mud and fallen trees from the streets. Hundreds of trucks from the government electricity company arrived in Acapulco early Wednesday, but seemed at a loss as to how to restore power, with downed electricity lines lying in feet of mud and water. Jakob Sauczuk was staying with a group of friends at a beachfront hotel when Otis hit. “We laid down on the floor, and some between beds,” Sauczuk said. “We prayed a lot.” One of his friends showed reporters photos of the windowless, shattered rooms in the hotel. It looked as if someone had put clothes, beds and furniture in a blender, leaving a shredded mass. Sauczuk complained that his group was given no warning, nor were offered safer shelter, by the hotel.

She viewed what she took as a chance to help her family after she lost the tin roof of her home and her family’s important documents in the hurricane. “When is the government ever going to look after the common people?” she said. Inside one store, National Guard officers allowed looters to take perishable items like food, but made futile efforts to prevent people from taking appliances, even as people outside loaded refrigerators on top of taxis. It took nearly all day Wednesday for authorities to partially reopen the main highway connecting Acapulco to the state capital Chilpancingo andMexico City. The vital ground link allowed dozens of emergency vehicles, personnel and trucks carrying supplies to reach the battered port. Acapulco’s commercial and military airports were still too badly damaged to resume flights. Acapulco's Diamond Zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, looked to be mostly underwater in drone footage that Foro TV posted online Wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water.

While little is known about possible deaths or the full extent of the damage — Acapulco was still mostly inaccessible by road as of late Wednesday — experts are calling Otis the strongest storm in history to make landfall along the Eastern Pacific Coast. Many of the once sleek beachfront hotels looked like toothless shattered hulks, after Hurricane Otis blew out hundreds — and possibly thousands — of hotel windows. Choked with mud and debris, with no electricity or internet service, the Pacific coast resort descended into chaos after the storm, as thousands engaged in massive looting. The hurricane had dissipated over the mountains by Wednesday afternoon, but left devastation in its wake. Jakob Sauczuk was staying with a group of friends at a beachfront hotel when Otis hit. “We laid down on the floor and some between beds,” Sauczuk said. “We prayed a lot.” One of his friends showed reporters photos of the windowless, shattered rooms in the hotel. It looked as if someone had put clothes, beds and furniture in a blender, leaving a shredded mess. He complained that his group was given no warning, nor were offered safer shelter, by the hotel. Pablo Navarro, an auto parts worker who was lodged in temporary accommodations at a beachfront hotel, thought he might die in his 13th story hotel room. “I took shelter in the bathroom, and thankfully the door held,” said Navarro. “But there were some rooms where the wind blew out the windows and the doors.” Navarro said authorities seemed to have been blindsided by the hurricane's rapid intensification. He stood Wednesday outside a discount grocery and household goods store near the hotel zone, as hundreds of people wrestled everything from packs of hot dogs and toilet paper to flat screen TVs out of the muddy store, struggling to push loaded metal shopping carts onto the mud-choked streets outside. “This is out of control, “ he said.

However, Galindo had yet to hear from her boyfriend, who was attending the same conference but staying in a different hotel. “Everybody is trying to find something out ... but no one knows anything,"" she said anxiously. The main highway into Acapulco was blocked by landslides for most of Wednesday, complicating efforts to reach people and effectively cutting off the city from essential resources. By late Wednesday, the roadway had been cleared only for emergency vehicles, authorities announced. Flor Campos trudged for more than an hour through mud along a highway outside Acapulco on Wednesday morning before she peeled off her shoes, worried she'd lose them in the muck. The domestic worker from a small town in Guerrero was among dozens of families, women and children who clambered over tree trunks and other debris left by landslides in the mountainous terrain. It was a daunting escape, but people were desperate to get out. “We had been waiting since 3 in the morning to get out, so we decided to walk. It was more dangerous to stay.” Campos said. On Tuesday, Otis took many by surprise when it rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 as it tore along the coast. Researchers tracking the storm told The Associated Press that the storm broke records for how quickly it intensified, at a time when climate change has exacerbated devastating weather events like this one. “It’s one thing to have a Category 5 hurricane make landfall somewhere when you’re expecting it or expecting a strong hurricane, but to have it happen when you’re not expecting anything to happen is truly a nightmare,” said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. Acapulco, Tecpan and other towns along the Costa Grande in Guerrero were hit hard, said Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. He said conditions were so bad that communication with the area had been “completely lost."" Acapulco is a city of nearly 1 million people at the foot of steep mountains. Luxury homes and slums alike cover the city’s hillsides with views of the glistening Pacific. Once drawing Hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, Acapulco has in more recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving many international tourists to the Caribbean waters of Cancun and the Riviera Maya or beaches farther down the Pacific coast in the state of Oaxaca. Damage to the local military airport made it hard for authorities to access the region, López Obrador said. Mexico’s Secretary of National Defense told the AP on Wednesday that 7,000 military personnel had been deployed to the area, and that over 1,200 more were on their way. Officials also said they were working to restore power and phone service. López Obrador noted that Otis was a stronger hurricane than Pauline, which hit Acapulco in 1997, destroying swaths of the city and killing more than 300 people. ___ Follow AP’s climate coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment ___ Associated Press writers María Verza in Mexico City and Seth Borenstein in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.","['mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'india', 'guatemala', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",us,True,False

At least 27 people have been killed after Hurricane Otis, one of the most powerful storms to ever hit Mexico, struck the Pacific beach resort of Acapulco. Otis, with winds of 270 kilometres per hour (165 miles per hour), ripped roofs from homes and hotels, tore trees from the ground, and largely cut off communications and road links with the region. Some hospitals were forced to evacuate patients amid flooding that inundated streets and left cars submerged in a trail of wreckage across the city of nearly 900,000 people. “What Acapulco suffered was really disastrous,” President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told a press conference in Mexico City on Thursday. Many of those killed were swept away in overflowing rivers, according to authorities. Four people remain missing. The government has not said how many were injured but has declared a state of emergency in the region. In a matter of hours, Otis intensified from a tropical storm to the most powerful category of the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale before hitting land, taking authorities by surprise. “It’s unprecedented in the country in recent times, not only because of the way it strengthened so quickly but also the magnitude of the hurricane,” Lopez Obrador said. The World Meteorological Organization described the hurricane as “one of the most rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones on record”. People in Acapulco recounted a terrifying ordeal as Otis made landfall overnight early on Wednesday. “The building shook as if there was an earthquake,” Citlali Portillo, a tourist accommodation manager, told the television channel Televisa, saying she had taken shelter in a bathtub. Erik Lozoya, a professional magician, said he endured “three hours of terror” with his wife and two baby daughters in an Acapulco hotel room as the hurricane smashed through the windows and swept through the building with deafening intensity. “It literally felt as though our ears were going to explode,” said the 26-year-old, who barricaded himself in a bathroom with his family and four others. “We saw mattresses, water tanks flying. The ceiling began to cave in.” Some residents slogged for hours through mud and debris in an attempt to find food and shelter. “Acapulco is a total disaster. It is not what it was before,” said 24-year-old Eric Hernandez. “The shops had all been looted, people were fighting for things. So we decided to walk as there wasn’t anything left there,” he said. Lopez Obrador travelled to Acapulco late on Wednesday by road, changing his vehicle more than once because of landslides and floods caused by the storm. One social media post showed him sitting in a military jeep stuck in mud. On Thursday afternoon, the government said the air traffic control tower of Acapulco’s international airport was up and running again and that an air bridge enabling tourists to reach Mexico City would be operating from Friday. Mexican authorities said Otis was the most powerful storm ever to strike Mexico’s Pacific coast. The defence ministry said nearly 8,400 members of Mexico’s army, air force and national guard had been deployed in and around Acapulco to assist in the cleanup. Acapulco is the biggest city in the southern state of Guerrero, one of the poorest in Mexico. The local economy depends heavily on tourism, and Otis caused extensive damage to some of the most famous hotels on the city’s coast. Calling the storm “totally devastating”, Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado said 80 percent of the city’s hotels had been hit by the storm and that authorities were working to restore electricity and reactivate drinking water pumps.

Both storms were Category 1hurricanes when they hit. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Norma, once a Category 4 hurricane, moved ashore with winds of 80 mph (130 kph) near el Pozo de Cota, west-northwest of Cabo San Lucas. Norma later weakened to a tropical storm with 70 mph (110 kph) winds as it crossed the Baja California Peninsula and by late Saturday it was nearing the Sea of Cortez, also known as the Gulf of California. Businesses in Cabo San Lucas had nailed plywood over their windows, and government personnel hung banners warning people not to try to cross gullies and stream beds after Norma regained strength and again became a major storm Friday. Norma was centered about 45 miles (70 kilometers) north-northeast of Cabo San Lucas late Saturday, the National Hurricane Center said. It was moving north-northeast at 6 mph (9 kph), but was expected to take a harder turn toward the east Sunday. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said via the platform X that there had so been no reported loss of life from the storm. “Hurricane Norma already passed Los Cabos and there are only torrential rains in La Paz, but without loss of life.” In Cabo San Lucas, curious tourists began to pick their way along debris-strewn beaches after the storm passed. The effects of the storm were still being felt after night fell, and authorities urged people to stay at home. There were still families in shelters in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo, though officials did not say how many. Around 200 people were in shelters in La Paz. Its languid pace raised the possibility of severe flooding. Norma was expected to dump six to 12 inches of rain, with a maximum of 18 inches in places across southern Baja California and much of Sinaloa state. John Cangialosi, a senior specialist at the National Hurricane Center, said the area is vulnerable to rain because it is a dry region generally. ""Six to 12 inches of rain is what is generally forecast, but there could be pockets of up to 18 inches of rain and we do think that will be the most significant impact that could result in flash and urban flooding and mudslides,” he said. Baja California Sur Gov. Victor Castro said via the platform X that “because it's moving slowly, greater damages are anticipated.” But little damage was initially reported. Some trees and power poles were down, but there were no reports of injuries. Police in San Jose del Cabo rescued two people from their truck when a surging stream swept it away early Saturday. Some informal settlements, away from the hotels that serve tourists, were isolated by rising water. Some neighborhoods lost electricity and internet service. The federal government posted 500 marines to the resort to help with storm preparations. By late morning, the area's streets were littered with palm fronds and other debris, and essentially deserted except for occasional military patrols. Strong winds whipped traffic signs, trees and power lines. Hotels in Los Cabos, which are largely frequented by foreign tourists, remained about three-quarters full and visitors made no major moves to leave en masse, officials said. The local hotel association estimated about 30,000 tourists were in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo on Friday. Airports were closed. San Jose del Cabo airport director Francisco Villaseñor said he expected flights to resume by midday Sunday. National Hurricane Center said Tammy came ashore Saturday night with 85 mph (140 kph) winds. The hurricane was moving north-northwest at 10 mph (17 kph) and by late Saturday was centered 15 miles (25 kilometers) north-northwest of Barbuda. Hurricane warnings remained in effect for the islands of Barbuda, Anguilla, St. Martin and St. Barthelmy. The warning was lifted for Antigua. The hurricane center said that “heavy rainfall and flooding (are) likely over much of the Lesser Antilles.” Tammy hit two weeks after Tropical Storm Phillippe swept by Antigua and Barbuda dumping six to eight inches of rain and plunging both islands into darkness. The slow-moving system was forecast to bring up to 12 inches over a twin island nation, where the devastation of Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Philippe's recent wind damage and flooding were still fresh memories. “This means therefore, that the earth is still somewhat saturated and with additional rainfall, the potential for flooding is elevated,” Prime Minister Gaston Browne said in a nationwide broadcast Friday. He urged residents to take all necessary steps to secure life and property. Government offices, banks and most non-retail businesses closed early on Friday to allow staff to prepare. Residents’ rushed to stock up on necessities, causing gridlock throughout St John’s and near popular shopping centers and supermarkets. Local disaster management officials announced plans to open about 40 shelters in communities throughout the country. ___ Associated Press writer Anika Kentish in St. John's, Antigua, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s climate coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment","['mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'bolivia', 'bolivia', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'hungary', 'antiguaandbarbuda', 'anguilla', 'france', 'spain', 'canada']",us,True,False

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said it was the largest federal investment ever in grid infrastructure, supporting projects that will harden electric systems and improve energy reliability and affordability. The federal spending, combined with money promised by private partners, could result in up to $8 billion in investments nationally to upgrade the grid, Granholm said. “The grid, as it currently sits, is not is not equipped to handle all the new demand” and withstand natural disasters and extreme weather worsened byclimate change, Granholm said at a news conference Wednesday. “We need it to be bigger, we need it to be stronger, we need it to be smarter” to bring a range of renewable energy projects online and meet the Biden administration’s goal of reaching 100% clean electricity by 2035, she said. Projects funded by the federalGrid Resilience and Innovation Partnershipsprogram will increase the flexibility, efficiency and reliability of electric power systems, with a particular focus on spurring solar, wind, and other renewable energy, Granholm said. The projects also are aimed at fixing problems that may contribute to wildfires and other disasters and will improve reliability by deploying innovative approaches to electricity transmission, storage and distribution, she and other officials said. Projects to be funded include $249 million each for rural areas in Georgia and Louisiana and $250 million for a Native American tribe in Oregon. The largest grant, $464 million, will go to improve five transmission projects across seven Midwestern states, from Iowa to North Dakota. The money includes $95 million previously announced for Hawaii in the wake of devastating wildfires this summer, and $150 million to PacifiCorp to upgrade the grid in California, Oregon, Utah and other states. “Our outdated grid has been in need of an update for a long, long time,″ said Mitch Landrieu, a White House senior adviser who coordinates implementation of the2021 infrastructure lawsigned by President Joe Biden. The grid “is especially vulnerable to the increasing impacts of the climate crisis,” Landrieu added. “Older equipment can overload during extreme heat and cold when power is needed most. And it’s more likely to fail when communities are washed out by historic floods and decimated by stronger storms.'' The nation's existing power grids are not built to handle the growing energy demand, a fact that is complicated by the intermittent nature of renewables, since energy isn’t generated when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind isn’t blowing. “As we sadly saw in California, aging electricity infrastructure can cause catastrophic loss of life, property, natural areas and forest fires,” said Jonathan Foley, executive director of Project Drawdown, a San Francisco-based group that publicizes climate solutions. The projects announced Wednesday are “exactly the kind of thing that we should be doing: promoting renewables, better storage and better electrical grids for a better, greener, more resilient future,” Foley said. In Georgia, the state's environmental finance authority and companies that supports Georgia's electric cooperatives will team up on a project to upgrade the grid, including investments in battery storage, local microgrids, grid reliability and new transmission lines. The project will focus on remote, historically underinvested communities, Granholm said, including rural Locust Grove, Georgia, where she visited Wednesday as part of the grant rollout. In Louisiana, two projects will focus on helping disadvantaged communities withstand extreme weather and develop microgrids to work with local utilities and back up existing assets. Entergy New Orleans also will enhance the local grid’s resilience to severe weather, including hardening existing transmission lines and distribution systems to reduce outage frequency and duration. CPS Energy in San Antonio will receive $30 million for a resiliency program, and Minnesota-based Xcel Energy will receive $100 million for projects in Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Minnesota and Wisconsin to improve wildfire risk mitigation, including thousands of fire-resistant poles, tree clearing and wind strength testing. Texas has faced repeated challenges, from sweltering heat this summer to a winter blackout in 2021 that knocked out power to millions of customers for days and resulted in hundreds of deaths. In Michigan, DTE Energy will deploy adaptive microgrids in the Detroit area to enhance reliability and reduce outages. In southeastern Pennsylvania, PECO Energy Co. will increase grid reliability and resilience through substation flood mitigation and replacing aging infrastructure. In Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs Reservation will work with Portland General Electric to upgrade transmission capacity and improve service east of the Cascade Mountains, including the reservation. ___ Associated Press writer Isabella O'Malley in New York contributed to this story.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'finland', 'finland', 'georgia', 'georgia', 'georgia', 'georgia']",us,True,True

President Lopez Obrador reported that communications were interrupted in the city, power lines were down affecting almost a million people, infrastructure is severely damaged and the roads to the port present important damages. (Photo by Luis Gutierrez/Norte Photo/Getty Images) My mouth dropped when I saw that a potential Category 5 hurricane was going to make landfall near Acapulco, Mexico. It is rare to see a hurricane of such extreme intensity directly impact a city with such a large population, and the outcome unfortunately was as expected. Nahel Belgherze posted on the platform X, “Acapulco, Mexico might have just become the first city of over a million inhabitants in the world to experience the eyewall of a Category 5 storm.” Images of the damage suggest that it will take years for the region to recover. Was it a forecast bust and what can we learn? There is no doubt that from an intensity perspective, Hurricane Otis far exceeded expectations. It exhibited rapid intensification, which is at least a gain of 35 mph of wind speed in less than 24 hours. In fact, Otis went from a Tropical Storm to a Category 5 hurricane in half of that time. This pace is what I have called hyper-intensification in recent storms. The models were way off so let’s go ahead and call it a bust. Even with such hyper-intensification, National Hurricane Center forecasters certainly had some perspective that explosive development was possible. Let’s review their forecast discussion from Tuesday, October 24th. Senior hurricane specialist Richard Pasch wrote, “Sea surface temperatures are very warm, around 30 deg C, and the low-to mid-level humidities are fairly high.” He also went on to note that there was only weak to moderate wind shear over the system, which is also a favorable condition for intensification. Pasch continued, “Steady strengthening seems likely until Otis makes landfall within the next day or so. Based on the current trends, the official intensity forecast is above most of the model guidance. The SHIPS Rapid Intensification (RI) indices show a greater than normal probability of RI, so some further upward adjustments to the intensity forecast are possible later today.” I have actually been impressed with how confidently NHC forecasters have been in mentioning rapid intesification. They certainly have plenty of practice in recent years. VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) sensor on the NOAA-20 satellite shows Hurricane ... [+] Otis at 08:30 Universal Time (2:30 a.m. in Acapulco) on October 24, 2023. After the storm, my former colleague and NASA research meteorologist Scott Braun said, “Conditions were present for rapid intensification, but it is hard to say at this time why the rate and magnitude of intensification were so great.” In the research community, Otis will be study for years to come. The models did not capture the level of intensification. Brian McNoldy is a hurricane expert at the University of Miami. His post below on the platform X is revealing. Hurricane specialist Eric Blake echoed this thought on the same thread. He wrote, “Every operational model missed it before the RI occurred and the EC was the best of the sad bunch, which is saying something because usually it has no intensity skill.” Though gains have been made, it has long been known that skill with hurricane track forecasts have outpaced intensity forecasts. I have written on this very topic previously in Forbes. Hurricane track is governed by larger scale atmospheric processes that can be sufficiently resolved in the models. Intensity changes are related to smaller scale features of the ocean heat content, wind shear, and energy exchanges within the eyewall structure. Many of these processes are often difficult to resolve in our models. A 2022 NOAA report argued, “Improving NOAA's hurricane intensity forecasts will require closing gaps in ocean and air-sea observations, as these data are key to better understanding the interaction processes that lead to the formation and intensification of storm systems.” Speaking of track, the forecasts certainly indicated that Acapulco would be dealing with some type of storm albeit a much weaker system. Forecasters knew that a tropical storm, at a minimul, would likely impact the region but as weather expert Tomer Burg remarks, it was certainly unexpected be a Category 5. We just do not expect this level of intensity in East Pacific hurricanes near the coast of Mexico. The damage was extensive but was primarily wind-related. The region is not accustomed to Category 5 storms, but this could be a harbinger of things to come. It is also a reminder that infrastructure of the future will have to be adapted to our new hurricane realities. Ironically, many people have asked why there was not more storm surge damage. Dr. Jeff Masters explains that the elevation and deep water profile offshore were not conducive for the level of storm surge one might expect from a Category 5 storm. Ultimately, I think the lesson from Otis may be to prepare for the worst if a tropical storm or hurricane is headed your way. The looming challenge of rapid (and hyper) intensification will be with us. Resist normaly or recency biases. They do not prepare you for a storm that you have not experienced before.","['mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'mexico', 'austria', 'unitedstates', 'not found']",us,True,False

By RFA Burmese 2023.10.09 -- Flooding in Myanmar has caused chaos across five regions, according to junta authorities, with 13,000 people in Bago region alone being relocated due to heavy rain. The Bago River overflowed, flooding 12 neighborhoods and seven villages across the region's capital, according to Lay Swe Zin Oo, the director of the Department of Disaster Management and the military-run Ministry of Relief and Resettlement. ""More than 13,000 people from over 3,000 households are moving to camps. There are about 34 camps in total,"" she told RFA. Residents were warned to evacuate early Sunday morning when the Bago River quickly rose more than one foot (30 cm) above critical level, according to the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology. By 6:30 a.m. Monday, the water had risen more than four feet above the critical level. By Monday afternoon, the water level had risen up Bago's clock tower and had submerged ground-floor apartments in some neighborhoods. Residents were trapped inside their homes, and some mobile phone services were disabled, Lay Swe Zin Oo later told RFA. People trapped in Bago city have been asking for help via Facebook. One city resident said he was using a boat to helping trapped friends who were trapped by boat. ""They can't go outside because the area is severely flooded,"" he said. The Bago River is still rising, said an official from the Metta San Yae Social Assistance Association, a local organization relocating residents affected by the floods. Bago residents said relief camps have been opened at the intersections of flooded neighborhoods, and some people have taken refuge in monasteries. Hundreds of passenger cars and trucks are stranded along portions of the old Yangon-Bago Highway and the new Yangon-Mandalay Expressway, a person on the road told RFA. According to a press release from the junta's Ministry of Information on Sunday, vans, buses and cargo trucks to and from the city would be paused until the water receded. Two train lines to Yangon from Mandalay region and Mon state were flooded, leaving more than 800 passengers stranded at the entrance of Bago city. Aid was being delivered to the passengers, who were being transferred to Yangon by car, the press release said, adding that four other train lines through Bago have been canceled this week. Bago region in central Myanmar has faced a challenging rainy season. In August, more than 18,000 residents were forced to move when more than a week of heavy rain flooded 13 neighborhoods. Other areas around the country have also been impacted by flooding, including Yangon and Mandalay regions, Mon and Shan states. Residents said Sunday that more than a hundred vehicles were stuck in places between Pyinoolwin township in Mandalay region and Nawnghkio township in Shan state. Despite the rainy season wrapping up, monsoons like this can occur at the very end of the season, said Hla Tun, director of the junta's Department of Weather and Hydrology. ""Monsoon season is not over in Bago, Yangon and the delta region of Ayeyarwady. It usually rains when the season is on its way out,"" he said.

Of all the things he’s found in the blue Mediterranean waters of Derna, the many bodies of children with vacant eye sockets and protruding bones haunt Bashir Saqr El-Hassi the most. The 42-year-old Libyan coastguard diver is solemn as he describes the experience of pulling out bodies that are still in the sea in the aftermath of thedevastating dam rupturenear Derna in early September. “I can’t help but think of my own children when I’m retrieving children who drowned. I’ve been away from my family for days,” El-Hassi said, his eyes gazing away. Overhearing him, one of his teammates steps in, recalling a sight that still haunts him. “One of the bodies was stuck under the rubble of a building and the fish were eating it. It was a tragic sight that I cannot describe,” he said. The pair are local divers, El-Hassi from the nearby city of Sousa, part of a squadron left to find missing bodies after international relief teams have largely left Libya, including navy divers from Egypt, Turkey, Malta and other countries. The eerily quiet divers pile onto boats to jump into the sea whenever the weather and waves permit, trying to salvage the bodies still in the waters. The storm burst two dams above Derna, causing floods that washed through the city, wiping out the landscape, sweeping away buildings and obliterating whole neighbourhoods. The death toll isestimated at thousands, with thousands more reported missing. “It’s a city down there. More so in the earlier days, as it was populated with bodies. But there’s still a city down there,” said one of the divers. El-Hassi has been in Derna since the first days of the catastrophe. “The mission was easier at the beginning because the bodies were intact. Now they’re very decomposed,” he said, adding it’s a race against time to retrieve as many bodies as possible before they fully disintegrate. The experienced diver has been on search missions before, but nothing prepared him for what he saw after the flood. “Of all my experience in diving missions retrieving the bodies of asylum seekers who drowned at sea, this by far has been the most difficult,” he said. The divers support each other before their daily missions. What they have seen is part of their collective memory, their toughest experiences together, encountering death on a daily basis, away from their families. Before each dive, El-Hassi makes sure to talk to his wife and children, whom he doesn’t see for days at a time. “I feel fear and anxiety. This experience has affected me deeply. I keep thinking about my family and what if they were the ones to have met this horrible fate,” he said, looking numb. It’s another day and El-Hassi and his team are preparing to look for more victims of the floods. He makes sure his oxygen tank is full to allow him the longest time underwater. Some divers will take the plunge without oxygen tanks for more speed and mobility, he said. He and the team captain then go over diving locations where they will search for more bodies. They have marked seven submerged vehicles to check during this dive. They were washed into the sea and have not yet been searched for drowned passengers. Before they know it, the grim day has passed and another search is complete. El-Hassi and the divers make their way back to Derna’s Mina Port after the gruelling mission. Though this is, without a doubt, his most difficult mission, it is one that El-Hassi believes in wholeheartedly, driven by his sense of humanity. The whole team feels the weight of the task entrusted to them: to help the families finally get closure and lay their loved ones to rest. “The cars we inspected today were empty,” El-Hassi said. “Tomorrow, if the waves and weather allow, we’ll check another spot.” This story has been published in collaboration withEgab.

State television MRTV reported Monday evening that the number of displaced people in Bago township, about 68 kilometers (42 miles) northeast of Yangon, the country's biggest city, had climbed to that figure, and they were taking shelter in 36 relief camps. It said almost 1,000 more people in Mon state's township, just east of Bago, were sheltering in three relief camps, and there some evacuations in a northern part of Yangon. A senior official at the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, Lay Shwe Zin Oo, said that constant rainfall in the Bago region that began last week caused the flooding in the low-lying areas of its capital, Bago township. She said there were no casualties reported so far. Bago township recorded 7.87 inches (200 millimeters) of rainfall, its highest level in 59 years, Myanmar’s Meteorological Department said Sunday. Rain or thundershowers was forecast for across the country until noon on Tuesday. One of the leaders of an emergency rescue team in Bago told The Associated Press that the flooding was up to about eight feet (2.3 meters) deep in low-lying areas and four feet (1.2 meters) downtown. “Almost the whole area of the town was flooded,” Thant Zin Maung, chairman of the Mizzima Thukha Charity Foundation said by phone on Monday. “It is the third flood in the town this year and the worst in many years. All the monasteries in the town have opened relief camps. Charity organizations are evacuating people from low-lying areas as much as they can.” A 55-year-old resident of Bago’s Pan Hlaing ward interviewed by phone said the floodwaters were as much as six feet (1.8 meters) deep in her neighborhood, and her family members were living on the second and third floors of their house. The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because Myanmar's military government prefers to tightly control the release of information, said the water was still rising steadily in her neighborhood, which had never flooded badly before. Social Welfare Ministry official Lay Shwe Zin Oo said Bago evacuees were sheltering in relief camps, schools and Buddhist monasteries, while the authorities were providing food, drinking water and other essential assistance. Reports in the state-run Myanmar Alinn newspaper on Monday said that trains that departed from Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city in central Myanmar, and from southern Mawlamyine township were halted en route. Scheduled departures from Yangon, the biggest city in the country, were canceled after rail lines were flooded by the rapid flow of water from mountain torrents and the spillage from dams in the Bago region. MRTV said almost 1,000 people in Mon state’s Kyaikto township, just east of Bago, were sheltering in three relief camps, and there some evacuations as well in a northern part of Yangon. Myanmar experiences extreme weather virtually every year during the monsoon season. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis killed more than 138,000 people. In July and August this year, floods in Mon, Kayin and Rakhine states and the regions of Bago and Magway killed five people and displaced about 60,000.","['myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'belgium']",us,False,False

By RFA Burmese 2023.10.14 -- Residents of Bago city in central Myanmar have begun cleaning up waterlogged streets, apartment buildings and stores following floods from heavy rain on Sunday. But as they strive to return to normalcy, many are struggling with related health issues, including diarrhea and colds. Flooding in Myanmar caused chaos across five regions, prompting 13,000 people in Bago region alone to relocate to relief camps or Buddhist monasteries for shelter. About 20 centimeters (8 inches) of rain fell in Myanmar over 24 hours â€” the highest level in nearly 60 years, according to the country's Department of Meteorology and Hydrology. A dozen neighborhoods and seven villages across the region's capital, Bago city, were inundated with water when the Bago River overflowed. Local charitable organizations have set up more than 30 relief camps to assist those affected. A city resident who sought temporary shelter at a flood relief center told Radio Free Asia that he is cleaning up the upper floor of his house so his family can return home, even though water remains on the lower level. Meanwhile, sections of the Yangon-Bago highway and several villages remain submerged as of Friday. About 40 miles from Bago, villagers living in communities along the highway are grappling with flooded fields. Farmers have reported that tens of thousands of acres of nearly ripe paddy fields in the region are submerged due to the flooding. Flooding caused by torrential monsoon rains also inundated the Mandalay and Yangon regions, displacing residents and disrupting traffic. Translated by RFA Burmese.

RFA Burmese 2023.10.13 -- More than 30,000 residents were forced to leave their homes and belongings behind in central Myanmar's Mandalay region after their villages were unexpectedly flooded, locals and relief workers said Friday. While parts of Madaya township, just north of Mandalay city, face yearly flooding from the nearby Ayeyarwady River, residents told Radio Free Asia that this year's quickly rising water levels came as a surprise. After continuous rain that began on Tuesday, local officials released excess water from Se Taw Gyi dam without alerting residents. ""The villages that are flooded every year are now facing severe flooding from both the river and the dam. Even the villages where water does not normally reach are flooded now,"" said a relief worker from Myanmar Rescue Madaya who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. ""We are helping from village to village and anti-regime defense forces are also helping. But relief is weak."" Residents evacuated on Thursday night into Friday morning, a local of Tha Pyay Chaung village told RFA. Locals and relief workers estimated that a total of 30,000 people had to move. ""There are many villages that are flooded. Villages that were not normally flooded [before] are flooded now. In the past, they [officials] used to inform the people by letter when they were about to release water from the dam,"" said the local. ""People are facing trouble now because they were not informed. The water went up to five feet (1.5 meters) in the house last night and we had to leave behind our belongings that we could not take."" The affected villages also include Inn Ta Khar, Waw Su, Wun Su, Oke Taik, Oke Set, Pan Kan Su and Ah Htet Taung Kaing villages. The resident said victims' livestock are also being relocated to higher ground. In flooded rural areas where antivenom can be scarce, he added that displaced victims were particularly concerned about being bitten by poisonous snakes common in the country's dry zone. RFA called Thein Htay, Mandalay region's economic minister and junta council spokesman, seeking comment on flooding in Madaya township, but he did not respond on Friday. Madaya township faced similar flooding in 2017 from Se Taw Gyi dam. Floods from heavy rain have also been affecting areas of Bago division, northern Shan and Mon states due to rising water levels in rivers since the second week of October. Translated by RFA Burmese.

State television MRTV reported Monday evening that the number of displaced people in Bago township, about 68 kilometers (42 miles) northeast of Yangon, the country's biggest city, had climbed to that figure, and they were taking shelter in 36 relief camps. It said almost 1,000 more people in Mon state's township, just east of Bago, were sheltering in three relief camps, and there some evacuations in a northern part of Yangon. A senior official at the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, Lay Shwe Zin Oo, said that constant rainfall in the Bago region that began last week caused the flooding in the low-lying areas of its capital, Bago township. She said there were no casualties reported so far. Bago township recorded 7.87 inches (200 millimeters) of rainfall, its highest level in 59 years, Myanmar’s Meteorological Department said Sunday. Rain or thundershowers was forecast for across the country until noon on Tuesday. One of the leaders of an emergency rescue team in Bago told The Associated Press that the flooding was up to about eight feet (2.3 meters) deep in low-lying areas and four feet (1.2 meters) downtown. “Almost the whole area of the town was flooded,” Thant Zin Maung, chairman of the Mizzima Thukha Charity Foundation said by phone on Monday. “It is the third flood in the town this year and the worst in many years. All the monasteries in the town have opened relief camps. Charity organizations are evacuating people from low-lying areas as much as they can.” A 55-year-old resident of Bago’s Pan Hlaing ward interviewed by phone said the floodwaters were as much as six feet (1.8 meters) deep in her neighborhood, and her family members were living on the second and third floors of their house. The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because Myanmar's military government prefers to tightly control the release of information, said the water was still rising steadily in her neighborhood, which had never flooded badly before. Social Welfare Ministry official Lay Shwe Zin Oo said Bago evacuees were sheltering in relief camps, schools and Buddhist monasteries, while the authorities were providingfood, drinking water and other essential assistance. Reports in the state-run Myanmar Alinn newspaper on Monday said that trains that departed from Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city in central Myanmar, and from southern Mawlamyine township were halted en route. Scheduled departures from Yangon, the biggest city in the country, were canceled after rail lines were flooded by the rapid flow of water from mountain torrents and the spillage from dams in the Bago region. MRTV said almost 1,000 people in Mon state’s Kyaikto township, just east of Bago, were sheltering in three relief camps, and there some evacuations as well in a northern part of Yangon. Myanmar experiences extreme weather virtually every year during the monsoon season. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis killed more than 138,000 people. In July and August this year, floods in Mon, Kayin and Rakhine states and the regions of Bago and Magway killed five people and displaced about 60,000.","['myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'belgium']",us,False,False

Abdoulaye Bathily, who is also UN Special Representative, said that plans floated by different institutions and leaders for reconstruction, run the risk of deepening the existing rift between the internationally recognized Government and rival administration in the east. He added that rebuilding could be impeded without an agreed plan going forward, and that failure to unify was ""at odds with the outpouring of solidarity, support and national unity shown by Libyan people from all corners of the country in response to the crisis."" ""UNSMIL calls on all relevant Libyan national and local authorities and Libya's international partners to facilitate agreement on a unified and coordinated Libyan national mechanism to direct the recovery and reconstruction efforts and to ensure transparency and accountability"", the UNSMIL chief said. Oil rich Libya has been in turmoil since the overthrow of former dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, which gave rise to rival power centres across the country and crises on multiple fronts, which have sucked in other regional powers to the simmering conflicts. Urging Libya's leaders ""to rise above divisions and come together to agree on a unified response to the reconstruction needs"", the UN Special Representative said the disaster caused by Storm Daniel - which has killed thousands and destroyed swathes of the northeast - ""also underscores the imperative to expedite negotiations on breaking the political stalemate."" Myanmar: humanitarian needs, landmine threats surge: OCHA In Myanmar, conflict and monsoon floods continue to cause new displacement, civilian casualties and destruction of civilian properties, worsening the already dire humanitarian situation there, the UN said on Monday. According to the UN's humanitarian affairs coordination office (OCHA), nearly two million people are internally displaced ""in precarious conditions"" and require lifesaving assistance. More than 63,000 people remain displaced across borders into neighbouring countries since the 2021 military takeover. OCHA said that the threat to civilians from explosive ordnance is spreading and that for the first time, anti-personnel landmine casualties have now been recorded in every state and region, except the capital Nay Pyi Taw. At least 1.8 million people have been reached with aid in the first half of the year, but OCHA warned that access and administrative restrictions are causing ""prolonged delays or postponements of scheduled relief efforts"", adding to the suffering of affected and displaced communities. To date, the humanitarian response plan and the flash appeal launched following May's deadly Cyclone Mocha, for a combined amount of $887 million, remain ""critically underfunded"" at only 28 per cent, OCHA said. Over 6,000 schools still closed in Burkina Faso: UNICEF UNICEF on Monday alerted that with the new school year starting, more than 6,000 schools remain closed because of violence and insecurity in parts of the country. That means that one in four schools in Burkina Faso are closed, impacting some one million children. In addition to this, at least 230 schools also currently serve as temporary shelters for more than 52,000 displaced people. UNICEF said that more than 3.8 million girls and boys are still managing to attend school, including in regions impacted by conflict. ""Our colleagues are working with the Ministry of Education and have helped over 760,000 children through formal education, accelerated schooling strategies, vocational training and education by radio"", said UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric. Around 5.5 million men, women and children need humanitarian assistance in Burkina Faso - 3.2 million of them children.","['libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'myanmar', 'myanmar']",us,False,False

""Children Displaced in a Changing Climate"", a joint report by UNICEF and the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center in partnership with the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, is a first-of-its-kind data analysis that shows 43 million children were forced to leave their homes in the past six years (2016-2022) — the equivalent of about 20,000 children every day — mainly due to floods and storms, but also droughts and wildfires. In Legazpi city, Albay province, the Philippines, on Nov. 11, 2020, families sheltered inside a school as Typhoon Vamco (known locally as Ulysses) bore down. yphoon Gona (Rolly) had devastated the area the week before. The island nation's location and geography make it prone to storms and floods. More than half of all child displacements from 2016 to 2022 happened in the Philippines, India and China. UNICEF report includes the first data set to focus on children Up until now, with previous data on displacement rarely distinguishing by age, these children have been statistically invisible. In places where there are other issues, like rapid urbanization, conflict and insecurity, the report notes, children on the move are even more likely to slip through the cracks. Researchers used data modeling to quantify past displacements and to project where children are likely to be displaced next. The risks of climate-related displacement are highest for children and families in countries like Mozambique, where there are limited capacities for coping with the fallout of storms and floods. Above, Francelina Antonio holding one of her two small children, took shelter at a school after the family's home was destroyed by strong winds and flooding caused by Cyclone Freddy. The report also identifies countries where a high risk of weather-related child displacement is compounded by factors such ashigh rates of poverty, conflict and other hazards — and where efforts toward risk mitigation and disaster preparedness work will be most critical. Children and communities are especially vulnerable in countries like Haiti and Mozambique, where the risk of weather disasters is high but capacities for coping with them are limited. Pakistan continues to suffer the effects of catastrophic flooding caused by record rainfall during the 2022 monsoons. Many families remain in temporary settlements, and many damaged schools remain closed. Above, a UNICEF-supported temporary learning center next to the floodwater in village Allah Dina Channa, Lasbela district, Baluchistan province. The many ways children who are displaced can suffer Displacement – whether short-lived or protracted, reactive or preemptive – can multiply climate-related risks for children and their families. In the aftermath of a disaster, children may become separated from their parents or caregivers, amplifying risks of exploitation, child trafficking and abuse. Displacement can also disrupt access to safe water, sanitation and health care, including essential vaccines, magnifying children's risk of disease. Schooling is often disrupted as well, jeopardizing children's futures. And displaced children and families don't necessarily end up in areas that are any less vulnerable to climate shocks. A young boy pulls a load of timber through a flooded field in Bentiu, Unity State, South Sudan, on Feb. 27, 2023. South Sudan and Somalia were the two countries with the greatest number of children displaced by flooding. Where in the world is this happening the most? In relative terms, Small Island Developing States and countries in the Horn of Africa are the most affected. Dominica, Saint Maarten, Northern Mariana Islands, Saint Martin, Cuba and Vanuatu recorded the most child displacements from storms, according to the report. South Sudan and Somalia experienced the greatest number of child displacements from floods — and both implement and record far fewer preemptive evacuations, suggesting children living in these hotspot locations are even more vulnerable. Hamza, 5, lives with his family in Lusharbak village, in Gulran district, western Afghanistan, an area affected by severe drought since 2020. Drought triggered more than 1.3 million internal displacements of children across 15 countries between 2016 and 2021. More than half — 730,000 — were recorded in Somalia, another 340,000 in Ethiopia and 190,000 in Afghanistan. Researchers caution that these numbers are likely to be radically underreported, due to the slow onset nature of the situation and poor reporting and monitoring mechanisms. Over the next 30 years, they project, tens of millions more children will be displaced by river flooding than cyclone winds or storm surges. Regions at highest risk are South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Read the full report. UNICEF’s call to climate action: protect, prepare and prioritize children Climate change factors into everything UNICEF does for children. The urgent need for communities and countries to adapt to and mitigate climate impacts and build resilience touches virtually every UNICEF program, from water and sanitation to health, nutrition, education and protection. Climate considerations are an integral part of UNICEF's emergency response and recovery work. With the release of the ""Children Displaced"" report, UNICEF repeated its call for global community to take action to better protect children and young people, and to better prepare them to live in a climate-changed world. Khadijo Mohamed Aden, a mother of four and farmer from Dinsoor, a town in the Bay region of Somalia, sits with her daughter Sabirin, 2, outside their makeshift home at the Gurman camp for internally displaced persons outside Mogadishu. Drought forced the family to leave home in search of food and water. Sabirin was treated for severe acute malnutrition at a UNICEF-supported health center. To improve outcomes for children and young people at risk of future displacement, UNICEF urges governments, donors, development partners and the private sector to ensure that child-critical services — education, health, social protection, child protection — are shock-responsive, portable and inclusive. Policies and solutions must prioritize their needs. And children and young people must be given opportunities to participate in climate action. UNICEF works with governments in regions and countries that are most at risk of climate-related displacements and other impacts to better prepare for and minimize those risks, develop and implement child-sensitive climate adaptation strategies, and design resilient and portable services to reach the most vulnerable children before, during and after disaster strikes. A young student inside a UNICEF-supported temporary learning center set up in Saleh Shah, Sindh province, Pakistan, for children impacted by the 2022 floods. Climate-induced flooding also hit Bangladesh, northern India and Afghanistan that year. Children suffer the most in climate-related crises — with those in the poorest communities bearing the biggest burden. UNICEF works with partners to keep children's needs at the forefront of climate action. Support UNICEF.

A tropical storm that's churning in the North Atlantic ocean is expected to begin moving West, strengthening as it makes landfall across a string of Caribbean islands in the coming days. Forecasters say the storm system, which is being called Tammy, could gradually strengthen into a hurricane in the next 48 hours, bringing heavy rain and storm surge to the region. Here's a look at what we know. The storm currently has sustained winds of 60 mph and is moving quickly to the west towards the Lesser Antilles, according to a Thursday morning advisory fromthe National Hurricane Center(NHC). Tammy is forecast to rake across many of the smaller island countries in the eastern Caribbean, with the center of the storm passing over the Leeward Islands on Friday and Saturday. Rainfall of up to 10 inches could produce flash flooding and mudslides. Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 feet. Tropical storm watches are in effect for Barbados, Dominica, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla, St. Barthelemy, St. Martin, Saba and St. Eustatius. Meteorologists say additional watches or warnings will likely be required on Thursday and Friday. Heavy rainfall of up to 4 inches is also expected to spread across the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this weekend. By Monday, the storm is expected to swing out to sea and no longer be a threat. So far this year, the NHC has tracked18 hurricanes and tropical storms, according to the last updated count, released Oct. 1. Only about a third of those made landfall, including Idalia, which left homes and businessesunderwater as it battered the Florida coast. This year's early storm activity prompted forecasters to update their2023 season outlook, changing their ""near-normal"" projection made in May to ""above-normal"" in August. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted 14 to 21 storms, with about half of those being full-blown hurricanes. The main reason scientists expected higher levels of hurricane activity is that ocean water in areas of the Atlantic Ocean is abnormally warm this year, part of a global trend of rising ocean temperatures. Federal officials have warned peoplewho live in hurricane-prone regions not to focus on the overall number of storms, as just one storm can cause significant damage. Some of the island nations in Tammy's paths arestill recovering from Hurricane Maria, a category 5 storm that nearly wiped out places like Dominica when it made landfall six years ago. Forecasters are tracking a second storm system,Hurricane Norma, as it travels towards Baja California, Mexico. A hurricane watch is in effect for the peninsula, stretching from Todos Santos to Los Barriles. The category 3 storm is expected to weaken as it approaches land on Saturday, but could still bring rainfall totaling 15 inches over the weekend.

News and Media Division . New York 5 October 2023 The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General. Alright, good afternoon. **Noon Briefing Guest As soon as you are done with me, we will be joined by our good friend, Imran Riza, who is the UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Lebanon. He will be here to brief you on the challenges facing Lebanon currently. **Ukraine We will start off with astatementon the latest developments in Ukraine: The Secretary-General strongly condemns today's attack which reportedly killed at least 49 people and injured several others in the Kupiansk district of Kharkiv region of Ukraine. Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law and they must stop immediately. The Secretary-General extends his condolences to the families of the victims and wishes a prompt recovery to all those injured. Also, our Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, Denise Brown, also issued a statement condemning the attack. In her statement, she called the images arriving from the site of the attack, absolutely horrifying. Our colleagues tell us that humanitarian workers in the country are mobilizing assistance to civilians harmed in the attack. **Autonomous Weapons Systems Also, I want to flag that this morning, the Secretary-General and the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric, issued ajoint appealto establish new international rules on autonomous weapon systems. They say that specific prohibitions and restrictions are needed to shield present and future generations from the consequences of their use. Autonomous weapon systems, which are generally understood as weapon systems that select targets and apply force without human intervention, pose serious humanitarian, legal, ethical and security concerns. In the current security landscape, setting clear international red lines will benefit all States, the Secretary-General and Ms. Spoljaric said. The autonomous targeting of humans by machines is a moral line which we must not cross. Machines with the power and discretion to take lives without human involvement should be prohibited under international law. That was shared with you. **Armenia Just a quick update from our UN team in Armenia, led by acting Resident Coordinator Natia Natsvlishvili, [which] is boosting support to national authorities as they address the needs of more than 100,000 refugees, who recently arrived. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) is continuing the distribution of locally procured core relief items requested by local municipalities, and these include foldable beds, bedding sets and blankets, near the border in Goris and Vayk municipalities, and near the capital, Yerevan. For its part, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) also continues its distribution of dignity kits and is working with local service providers to prevent gender-based violence. UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) trained social workers in child protection in emergency settings and has also established the first of two support centres in the main refugee recipient town of Goris, with the Armenian Red Cross, helping reconnect families with separated children. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), for its part, is purchasing equipment to address the rising needs of refugees and host communities, and these equipments include solar panels and water heaters, along with bio-toilets. **Libya Turning to Libya, our humanitarian colleagues tell us that survivors of catastrophic flooding in the north-east of the country urgently need shelter, protection, health care — including mental health care — as well as water, sanitation and hygiene supplies. That's according to a new assessment that was carried out in areas impacted by Storm Daniel. Buildings were severely damaged by the floods in more than a third of the locations assessed by an inter-agency team. Some 42,000 people are still displaced, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Many need cash to cover rent and support shelter repairs. Though water supplies are available, they are not always safe and not always affordable. Nearly two-thirds of health facilities are either out of service or only partially functioning, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and more than 100 health workers were killed during the floods. Meanwhile, UNICEF says that nearly 100 damaged schools remain closed. We and our partners have reached 125,000 people with relief items and protection services, but to continue these efforts, we need reliable funding. To date, our Flash Appeal for more than $70 million to help flood survivors is only one-third funded. **Sudan The Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for the UN in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, warned today that the country's population is ""balancing on a knife's edge"" as Sudan is gradually consumed by the ongoing conflict. With some 5.4 million men, women and children having fled their homes, Sudan has become the fastest-growing displacement crisis in the world, with half of the country's population — that is 24.7 million human beings — now requiring humanitarian aid. Ms. Nkweta-Salami also warned that the conflict could reach areas like Jazirah State, the country's breadbasket. On the health front, 70 per cent of all hospitals are no longer functioning. She expressed concern about battling cholera outbreaks in war zone areas, as the current heavy rains and floods could lead to more outbreaks of water-borne diseases. We and our partners have reached at least 3.6 million people working with and through Sudanese humanitarian workers, civil society organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The $2.6 billion Humanitarian Response Plan for Sudan is only 32.8 per cent funded. We need more resources to help more people. **South Sudan Moving south, to South Sudan, Nicholas Haysom, the Secretary-General's Special Representative in that country and Head of our Peacekeeping Mission there, addressed the thirty-second plenary of the Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission. He did that in the capital Juba today. He said that a sense of urgency is required to progress the implementation of the Roadmap. With just 14 months until scheduled elections, Mr. Haysom noted the need to reconstitute and resource key electoral institutions like the National Constitutional Review Commission, National Elections Commission, and the Political Parties Council. He warned that in the absence of a functioning Political Parties Council, no party has been able to register lawfully, thereby creating a strong perception of a lack of a level playing field amongst the various political parties. **Mauritius And in Mauritius, our UN team there has welcomed the Mauritius Supreme Court's landmark decision, which was taken yesterday, to decriminalize consensual same-sex relations. Resident Coordinator Lisa Singh said that the Court's decision to overturn an obsolete colonial law demonstrates a commitment to non-discrimination and to leaving no one behind. She added that the UN team and regional and international partners welcome Mauritius' decision to join the growing list of African countries protecting the human rights of everyone, including LGBTQI+ people. **Special Political Missions And at 1:15 p.m., if you have no plans for lunch, I encourage you to head down to the ECOSOC (Economic and Social Council) Chamber, where there will be a special event to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Special Political Missions. As you may know, the first Special Political Mission was deployed in May 1948 after the General Assembly mandated a UN Mediator to Palestine and the subsequent appointment of Folke Bernadotte as the UN mediator. The event is jointly organized by the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and the Permanent Missions of Finland and Mexico. Speakers include our Chef de Cabinet, Courtenay Rattray; the Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, Rosemary DiCarlo, as well as the Secretary-General's envoys for Colombia, Yemen and the Horn of Africa. And as I said, you're all invited. **World Teachers' Day Today is an International Day we can all learn from. Today is [World] Teachers' Day. Forty-four million additional teachers are still needed worldwide to achieve quality education for everyone, everywhere. In a post on the Twitter platform, the Secretary-General invites everyone to celebrate the value of teaching and commit to reverse the current teacher shortage. And I would not be here without some great teachers. So, Edie? **Questions and Answers Question: Thank you, Steph. The Copernicus Climate Group data released today said September was the hottest September ever by a very significant amount. Does the Secretary-General have any comment? Spokesman: Well, I think, sadly, this is no surprise. We've been living in the hottest summer on record. I think it's just one more piece of scientific data that we hope will motivate people around the world, and especially political leaders, to take bold action and make bold decisions to help us fight climate change. Question: And on a completely different subject. Are there any talks going on anywhere regarding the Black Sea Grain Initiative? Spokesman: Anything? Nothing that I'm able to share with you at this point. Michelle? Correspondent: That wasn't a total denial. Spokesman: A question is asked and... okay. Question: Okay. You can't give us any detail of what talks might be happening? Spokesman: Not at this point. Not at this point. Question: But talks are happening? Spokesman: But I think the Secretary-General has been very clear in his determination in regard to ensuring that Russian and Ukrainian grain and fertilizer are fully out to market in a predictable manner. And both Rebeca Grynspan and Martin Griffiths are working in that direction. Spokesman: That's as many words as you'll get out of me right now today. Just on the attack that you mentioned in Ukraine, does the UN have any assessment on who might be responsible for that attack? Spokesman: You know, I think I would refer you to what Denise Brown said. She condemned this Russian attack. Madam? Question: Damilola Banjo, Dag fellow. I have two questions on the Kenya-led mission to Haiti. So, there hasn't been parliamentary approval for this mission in Kenya itself. Shouldn't this have been the first step, even before it's presented to the Security Council? Still on that, are there mechanisms in place to ensure that the Kenya-led mission to Haiti abides by international law, given Kenyan's police reputation for human right abuses? Are there strict guidelines that they must follow? Thank you. Spokesman: Sure. On the first part, it's not for me to comment on internal Kenyan political processes, right? That's a question you need to ask the Kenyan mission, the Kenyan authorities. On the issue of human rights, I think the Secretary-General has stressed that it is important on preventing any misconduct by any police that will be deployed by any country within the context of Haiti. And he had advocated for some very robust prevention and response frameworks in that regard. It is important that anyone who is deployed to Haiti from any country be deployed and act under a framework of protecting people's human rights. Yeah? Correspondent: Yeah. And before I ask my question, I'm no longer withHürriyetanymore. I am withSozcuTV and newspaper. Which is....Sozcumeans Spokesman in Turkish, so I am the Spokesman. Spokesman: Maybe that's my next project. Yeah. Question: Yeah. Anyway, my question is, now, do you have any statement about the latest development in northern Syria? You know, today, there are reports that Turkish drone shot down by United States aircraft. And, you know, it's getting serious there. Spokesman: I think we're very concerned about the latest rounds of violence that we're seeing. And again, it creates the situation where civilians pay a very high price. Question: It's kind of follow up. What efforts has the UN made to reduce the conflict in north-east Syria? As you know, like, even this morning, the Turkish drones killed six Kurdish people in north-east Syria. Spokesman: Well, our efforts have always been focused on finding a political solution, right? And I think Geir Pedersen was here not long ago. He spoke to you outside of the Security Council. There is a framework set up by the Security Council. It is important that all concerned work towards the implementation of that framework and support the work of Mr. Pedersen. Evelyn? Question: It's on Sudan. You asked for quite a large contribution for aid. How is it being distributed? Are there UN workers in Sudan that can distribute... Spokesman: I think what I just said is that we have international UN staff, mostly folk in Port Sudan. We are working with Sudanese NGO, Sudanese humanitarian workers, and our Sudanese partners in sending out the aid that is necessary. Question: And they can distribute it? Spokesman: Well, they're on the front lines of this conflict. Can they distribute it? They have to work around checkpoints and conflict and work in very difficult situations. Yes, Margaret? Question: Steph, speaking on Sudan, any progress in replacing Mr. [Volker] Perthes as Head of the Mission? Spokesman: Progress will be announced from here when progress has been achieved. Question: Any names on the shortlist you care to share? Spokesman: Is this your first rodeo? Correspondent: Hope springs eternal. Spokesman: Yeah. Hope springs eternal. I do want to share, though, a more detailed reaction to the events in Syria, which is that the Secretary-General is deeply concerned about the drone attack on a military academy graduation in Homs, which reportedly resulted in dozens of casualties, including civilians and numerous injuries. The Secretary-General is also deeply concerned about the retaliatory shelling by pro-government forces on multiple locations in north-western Syria and emerging reports of casualties. A nationwide ceasefire is essential for a meaningful political process to implement Security Council resolution 2254. The Secretary-General strongly condemns all violence in Syria and urges all parties to respect their obligations under international law. He also recalls that civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected in accordance with international humanitarian law at all times. Okay. Stefano, and then we'll go to our guest. Question: Thank you, Stéphane. The European Union apparently reached a deal on how to handle the migrants and also political... well, we can call it the refugees and so on. Do you have any reaction? And do you think that they will... I mean, are you looking for something that is in this agreement? Spokesman: I would refer you to both IOM and UNHCR at this point for an immediate reaction. Sorry, we'll go to Benno and then we'll go to the guest. Question: Thank you, Steph. That was not clear enough. You just told us that the Russian attack in Ukraine is against our international humanitarian law. Can a country that violates international humanitarian law be part of the UN Human Rights Council? The elections are next week; Russia's running for a seat. Spokesman: It is up to Member States to vote and to decide who will sit on the Council. That's it. Alright. Let me get Imran and I'll be right back.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'lebanon', 'lebanon', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'not found', 'not found', 'armenia', 'georgia', 'georgia', 'libya', 'libya', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'southsudan', 'southsudan', 'palestinianterritories', 'mexico', 'colombia', 'yemen', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'haiti', 'haiti', 'haiti', 'haiti', 'syria', 'syria', 'syria', 'syria', 'syria', 'syria', 'syria', 'malaysia', 'malaysia', 'russia', 'turkey']",us,True,False

Excavators have begun drilling with heavy machinery to fix a wide steel pipe that will help pull out almost 40 Indianworkers trapped insidea collapsed Himalayan highway tunnel that caved in two days ago in the north Indian state of Uttarakhand. The 4.5km (2.7-mile) tunnel, which was being built on a national highway as part of a Hindu pilgrimage route,caved inat about 5:30am on Sunday (24:00 GMT on Saturday). “We have been supplying food, water and oxygen to the trapped labourers and the officials are in continuous touch with all of them,” Devendra Singh Patwal, a disaster management official, said on Tuesday. More than 100 rescue workers are using heavy machinery to drive a steel pipe with a width of 90cm (nearly three feet), wide enough for the trapped men to squeeze through the rubble, the government’s highway and infrastructure company said. Patwal said it was not easy to ascertain the time required to pull out the workers. A team of geologists from the state government and educational institutions had arrived to determine the cause of the accident, he added. “Our biggest breakthrough is that we have established contact and there is a supply of oxygen and food,” Uttarkashi district’s top civil servant Abhishek Ruhela told AFP news agency on Tuesday. “Whatever is necessary for their survival is being done.” Oxygen was being pumped into the tunnel and small food items like dry fruit were being provided to the workers, he added. Photographs released by government rescue teams soon after the collapse showed huge piles of rubble blocking the wide tunnel, with twisted metal bars from its roof poking down in front of slabs of concrete. The region is prone to landslides, earthquakes and floods and the incident follows events of land subsidence in the state that geologists, residents and officials have blamed on rapid construction in the mountains. The work on the tunnel stretch commenced in 2018 and was initially intended to be completed by July 2022, which has now been delayed to May 2024, an Indian government statement said. The Char Dham pilgrimage route is one of the most ambitious projects of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government. It aims to connect four important Hindu pilgrimage sites of north India through 889km (551 miles) of a two-lane road being built for $1.5bn. But some work has been halted by local authorities after hundreds of houses weredamaged by subsidencealong the routes, including in ecologically fragile Uttarakhand. Accidents on large infrastructure projects are common in India. In 2021, at least 200 people, most of them construction workers, were killed after part of a Himalayan glacier broke away, causing flash floods in Uttarakhand in a disaster that experts partly blamed on excessive development.

Together with collaborators from five other institutions, Torres helped show that high rates of carbon breakdown persist from mountaintop to floodplain, as the carbon bound in rock that was once prehistoric ocean floor gets released into the atmosphere through erosion and weathering.According toa studypublished inProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers used rhenium—a silvery-gray, heavy transition metal—as a proxy for carbon. Understanding the Earth's natural, pre-anthropogenic carbon cycle offers valuable insights into the planet's history and its response to current climate challenges.""The purpose of this research was to quantify the rate at which Earth naturally releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and find out whether this process varies across different geographic locations,"" Torres said.Traditionally, understanding this process has been challenging as it involves complex chemical reactions that transform rocks into gases likecarbon dioxide, making it difficult to quantify.""This research used a newly developed technique pioneered by Robert Hilton and Mathieu Dellinger that relies on a trace element—rhenium—that's incorporated in fossil organic matter,"" Torres said. ""As plankton die and sink to the bottom of the ocean, that dead carbon becomes chemically reactive in a way that adds rhenium to it.""Over vast periods of time,geological processescan cause the rock on the ocean floor to be thrust to the Earth's surface asmountain rangesand the ancient carbon locked in the rock gets slowly released in the atmosphere. As this happens, rhenium is left behind, which can be measured in water.Unlike other elements in fossil carbon—such as nitrogen or phosphorus—which are taken up by plants or become part of other chemical orbiological processes, rhenium is relatively inert, making it a good tool for gauging how much carbon gets released into the atmosphere from the Earth's crust.""Organisms don't care about it—it's not a nutrient,"" Torres said. ""It just passively gets incorporated into rivers, where we can measure it. A good proxy is one that only responds to the process you're trying to study.""You have to know a lot about rhenium as an element and its chemistry and the environment to be able to interpret it in this way. There is a lot of interpretive work that has had to come before these measurements that allows us to say that the only host for this element is the fossil carbon evaporated into the atmosphere.""The Rio Madre de Dios basin was an ideal location for studying this question because it provided a natural gradient from the heights of one of the tallest mountain ranges down to the floodplains of the world's largest river by volume. Moreover, the rock types exposed at this site are carbon-rich shales, which Torres says is exactly what you would want to study in this case.The Rio Madre de Dios basin is rife with carbon-rich shales, the ideal rock type to study for the purposes of the project. Credit: Mark Torres/Rice University""I'm very excited about this tool,"" Torres said. ""Rice students have deployed this same method in our lab here, so now we can make this kind of measurement and apply it at other sites. In fact, as part of current research funded by the National Science Foundation, we are applying this technique in Southern California to learn how tectonics and climate influence the breakdown of fossil carbon.""By grasping the slow processes that govern our planet's carbon cycle, scientists can build more accurate climate models and work toward more effective strategies of mitigating the impact of anthropogeniccarbonemissions.Torres is an assistant professor of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Rice.

Here, a Louisiana home damaged by a hurricane sits waiting for unaffordable repairs.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption Climate change is expensive, deadly and preventable, according to the new National Climate Assessment, the most sweeping, sophisticated federal analysis of climate change compiled to date. Released every five years, the National Climate Assessment is a congressionally mandated evaluation of the effects of climate change on American life. This new fifth edition paints a picture of a nation simultaneously beset by climate-driven disasters and capable of dramatically reducing emissions of planet-warming gasses in the near future. This is the first time the assessment includes standalone chapters about climate change's toll on the American economy, as well as the complex social factors driving climate change and the nation's responses. And, unlike past installments, the new assessment draws heavily from social science, including history, sociology, philosophy and Indigenous studies. The new approach adds context and relevance to the assessment's robust scientific findings, and underscores the disproportionate danger that climate change poses to poor people, marginalized communities, older Americans and those who work outdoors. ""Climate change affects us all, but it doesn't affect us all equally,"" says climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, one of the authors of the assessment. But threaded throughout the report are case studies and research summaries highlighting ways ""climate action can create a more resilient and just country,"" she says. This is also the first time the National Climate Assessment will be translated into Spanish, although the Spanish-language version won't be available until the spring, according to the White House. The National Climate Assessment is extremely influential in legal and policy circles, and affects everything from court cases about who should foot the bill for wildfire damage, to local decisions about how tall to build coastal flood barriers. ""It really shapes the way that people understand, and therefore act, in relation to climate change,"" says Michael Burger, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. Hundreds of scientists from universities, industry, and federal agencies contributed to the report. They reviewed cutting-edge research published since the last report and contextualized it in decades of foundational climate research. The fifth edition of the assessment arrives as millions of Americans are struggling with the effects of a hotter Earth. Dramatic and deadly wildfires, floods and heat waves killed hundreds of people in the United States in 2023. And, while federal spending on renewable energy and disaster preparedness has increased, the U.S. is alsoinvesting in new fossil fuel infrastructurethat is not compatible with avoiding catastrophic warming later this century. Here are the three big takeaways from theFifth National Climate Assessment. More information about the specific effects of climate change in your area can be found in the assessment'sregional chapters. Windmills near Whitewater, Calif., in 2020. Reducing fossil fuel use and investing more in renewable energy sources such as wind will help the U.S. avoid billions of dollars of economic costs and help Americans live longer, healthier lives according to the Fifth National Climate Assessment.Ringo H.W. Chiu/APhide caption Windmills near Whitewater, Calif., in 2020. avoid billions of dollars of economic costs and help Americans live longer, healthier lives according to the Fifth National Climate Assessment. Food, housing, labor – it all gets pricier as the Earth heats up, according to the National Climate Assessment. Climate-driven weather disasters, like heat waves, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, are particularly expensive. They destroy homes and businesses, wreck crops and create supply shortages by delaying trucks, ships and trains. Such disasters make it more likely that families will go bankrupt, and that municipal governments will run deficits, the authors note. Weather-related disasters in the U.S. cause about $150 billion each year in direct losses, according to the report. That's a lot of money – roughly equal to the annual budget for the Energy Department – and it's only expected to go up as the Earth gets hotter. Loading... And that's all before factoring in the less obvious or tangible costs of climate change. For example, healthcare bills for people who are sicker because of extreme heat, or have respiratory illness brought on by breathing in mold after a flood. Exposure to wildfire smoke alone costs billions of dollars a year in lost earnings, the assessment notes – a burden that falls disproportionately on poor people who work outdoors. ""The research indicates that people who are lower income have more trouble adapting [to climate change], because adaptation comes at a cost,"" says Solomon Hsiang, a climate economist at the University of California, Berkeley and a lead author of the assessment. For example, one of the simplest ways to adapt to severe heat waves is to run your air conditioner more. But ""if people can't pay for it, then [they] can't protect themselves,"" explains Hsiang. And the hotter it gets, the more profound the economic harm, assessment warns. Twice as much planetary warming leads to more than twice as much economic harm, the assessment warns. A roadside memorial to those who died in the wildfire that swept through the town of Lahaina, Hawaii in August. The latest National Climate Assessment underscores the many ways that climate change is already making Americans sick, and even killing them.Claire Harbage/NPRhide caption A roadside memorial to those who died in the wildfire that swept through the town of Lahaina, Hawaii in August. The latest National Climate Assessment underscores the many ways that climate change is already making Americans sick, and even killing them. Since the previous NCA was released five years ago, the health costs of climate change have gone from theoretical to personal for many Americans. The most obvious risk? Extreme weather, particularly heat, says Mary Hayden, the lead author of the chapter examining human health. Heat waves have become hotter, longer, and more dangerous, and they're hitting areas that aren't ready for them–like the ""record-shattering"" heat dome that descended on the Pacific Northwest in 2021 and caused hundreds of deaths. But it's not just heat. Wildfire smoke can send people thousands of miles from the fires to hospitals with respiratory problems and heart disease complications. Hurricanes can disrupt people's access to healthcare: when a clinic is flooded or people are displaced, for example,kidney patients can't get dialysis treatment. In most cases, the people who bear the brunt of the disasters are those already at risk: poor communities, communities of color, women, people with disabilities, and other marginalized groups. Temperatures in formerly redlined neighborhoods in cities across the country cansoar nearly 15 degrees Fahrenheit hotterthan wealthier areas just blocks away, putting residents at much higher risk of heat exposure. The assessment also homes in on research tracking less-obvious health impacts. Living through climate disasters, for example, can leave lasting emotional scars. ""We're not just talking about [people's] physical health–we're talking about their mental health. We're talking about their spiritual health. We're talking about the health and well-being of communities which are being affected by this,"" Hayden says. That means recognizing the long-term effects on communities like Paradise, California, where people still deal withdeep emotional traumafive years after their town burned in the 2018 Camp Fire. The report also flags the growing emotional toll on children and young people, for whom anxiety about the future of the planet is bleeding into all parts of their lives. A lobsterman paddles out to his boat in a harbor in Maine. Climate change is disrupting ways of living with, and from, the ocean.Ryan Kellmanhide caption The places, cultural practices, and traditions that anchor many communities are also in flux because of climate change. Fishing communities are seeing their livelihoods shift or collapse. The Northeast's iconic lobster fishery, the single most economically valuable in the country, haswithered as marine heatwaves sweep through the regional seas. Shrinking snowpack and too-warm temperatures are interrupting opportunities for beloved recreational activities,like skiing or ice fishing. Indigenous communities are being forced to adjust to new climate realities, which are disrupting traditional food-gathering traditions. In Palau, a monthly tradition of catching fish at a particularly low tide has been upset by sea level rise, which keeps water levels too high to trap fish in thehistorically-used places. Sea level rise is also forcing coastal communities tore-think their very existence,pulling apart the social fabric that has developed over generations. But many communities – Indigenous people, farmers and fishers, groups that have lived tightly connected to their environments for a long time – have deep stores of resilience from which to draw, says Elizabeth Marino, a sociologist and the lead author of the chapter on social transformations. ""There is quite a lot of wisdom in place to adapt to and even mitigate climate change,"" she says. ""It allows people to come up with solutions that fit the lives that they lead, and that's also a place of hope."" The fifth assessment lays out a stark picture of the climate challenges the U.S. faces. Keeping planetary warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the goal of the international Paris Agreement, will require immediate, enormous cuts to fossil fuel emissions in the U.S and beyond. Keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), an ambitious target written into the Agreement, will be even harder, the report says. But it also points out many successful efforts underway to adapt to the new reality and to prevent worse outcomes. ""It's not the message that if we don't hit 1.5 degrees, we're all going to die,"" says Hayhoe. ""It's the message that everything we do matters. Every 10th of a degree of warming we avoid, there's a benefit to that."" Addressing fossil fuel-driven climate change can also help people live healthier lives, stresses J. Jason West, the lead author on a chapter on air quality. Dialing back fossil fuel emissions would help prevent further climate change and also lessen the kinds of air pollution most harmful to human health."" There really is a lot of opportunity to take action that would resolve both of those problems at the same time,"" West says. There's been a subtle shift in the report's perspective since the last one, says Candis Callison, a sociologist and author of the report. There's now a clear acknowledgement, developed through years of rigorous research, that the fossil fuel-powered society the U.S. built over generations was profoundly unjust. Many pollution-producing coal or gas power plants weresited in communities of colorrather than white communities, affecting people's health outcomes for generations. And decisions about land and water use for energy extractionoften excluded tribal communities, with consequences still playing out today. The transition forward can look different, she says. ""Climate change actually provides us with an opportunity to address some of those inequities and injustices–and to respond to these impacts,"" Callison says. ""That's really a powerful thing.""","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'germany', 'palau']",us,True,True

The report issues a stark warning that extreme events and harmful impacts of climate change that Americans are already experiencing, such as heat waves, wildfires, and extreme rainfall, will worsen as temperatures continue to rise. The Fifth National Climate Assessment, issued every five years, is a definitive breakdown of the latest in climate science coming from 14 different federal agencies, including NOAA, NASA, the EPA, and the National Science Foundation. This year's report is more comprehensive than in previous because climate modeling has improved, and the authors took a more holistic look at physical and social impacts of climate change. ""We also have a much more comprehensive understanding of how climate change disproportionately affects those who've done the least to cause the problem,"" Katherine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and co-author of the report, said in a briefing with reporters. Some communities are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, the report says, warning that Black, Hispanic, and indigenous communities are more likely to face challenges accessing water as droughts become more intense. Climate change also creates more health risks for marginalized communities, according to the report, which says that “systemic racism and discrimination exacerbate” the impacts. The report lays out how every part of the US is being impacted by climate change and that some areas are facing multiple worsening impacts at the same time. For example, western states saw heat waves and wildfires during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which strained resources and added to the risk of severe illness. In the same year, back-to-back storms during the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season are some examples of climate-driven compounding events that caused unprecedented demand on federal emergency response resources. The report detailed some impacts of climate change that are being felt across the U.S., including increased risk of extreme heat and rainfall, among other weather-related events. Other impacts cited werecoastal erosionand threats to coastal communities from flooding; damage to land including wildfires anddamage to forests;warming oceans and damage to ecosystems likecoral reefs;risks from extreme events like fires; heatwaves and flooding, and increased inequality for minority orlow-income communities. Some areas of the U.S. are also seeing more specific impacts, such as more intense droughts in the Southwest. The assessment also notes changes in storm trends as a result of climate change. Heavy snowfall is becoming more common in the Northeast and hurricane trends are changing, with increases in North Atlantic hurricane activity and the intensification of tropical cyclones. 2023 was a record setting year forbillion-dollar climate disastersin the United States, officials noted in a White House briefing last week. The report also highlights some areas of success, saying more action has been taken across the board to reduce emissions and address climate change since the last report in 2018. Greenhouse gas emissions generated by the U.S. have been steadily decreasing since their peak in 2007, even as the energy demand goes up -- mainly due to a vast reduction in the use of coal, according to the report. Efforts to adapt to and respond to climate change need to be more ""transformative,"" the report found. This includes reducing the use of coal, building more wind turbines and electrifying buildings and making more efforts to protect people from the impacts of climate change. Individuals and government leaders should look at the report as a way to help communities across the country mitigate, adapt and become more resilient to the effects of climate change, White House Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi said. The assessment demonstrates ""both a real and profound environmental risk, but also a real and profound economic opportunity,"" Zaidi said. The administration has also noted that adding clean energy jobs is a top priority. The last time the National Climate Assessment was released, then-President Donald Trump said hedid not believe the findings. The 2018 report found that climate change could lead to massive economic loss, especially by vulnerable communities. In addition to theFifth National Climate Assessment, which is U.S.-focused, two global climate reports were also released on Tuesday, analyzing the current state of climate change policy action around the world. UN Climate Changereleased a progress report on climate action ahead of the COP28 conference set to kick off in Dubai on November 30th. The report highlights that progress on global climate action is moving too slow to keep up with the effects of global warming. ""The Global Stocktake report released by UN Climate Change this year clearly shows where progress is too slow. But it also lays out the vast array of tools and solutions put forward by countries. Billions of people expect to see their governments pick up this toolbox and put it to work,"" Simon Stiell, Executive-Secretary of UN Climate Change said. The 2023 State of Climate Actionreportwas also released on Tuesday, highlighting similar concerns that global climate action is not moving fast enough. ""In a year where climate change has been wreaking havoc across the world, it’s clear global efforts to curb emissions are falling short.""

TheNational Climate Assessment, which comes out every four to five years, was released Tuesday with details that bring climate change's impacts down to a local level. Overall, it paints a picture of a country warming about 60% faster than the world as a whole, one that regularly gets smacked with costly weather disasters and faces even bigger problems in the future. Since 1970, the Lower 48 states have warmed by 2.5 degrees (1.4 degrees Celsius) and Alaska has heated up by 4.2 degrees (2.3 degrees Celsius), compared to the global average of 1.7 degrees (0.9 degrees Celsius), the report said. But what people really feel is not the averages, but when weather is extreme. With heat waves, drought, wildfire and heavy downpours, “we are seeing an acceleration of the impacts of climate change in the United States,” said study co-author Zeke Hausfather of the tech company Stripe and Berkeley Earth. And that's not healthy. Climate change is ""harming physical, mental, spiritual, and community health and well-being through the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events, increasing cases of infectious and vector-borne diseases, and declines in food and water quality and security,"" the report said. Compared to earlier national assessments, this year’s uses far stronger language and “unequivocally” blames the burning of coal, oil and gas for climate change. Read more:How Psychology Can Help Fight Climate Change—And Climate Anxiety The 37-chapter assessment includes an interactive atlas that zooms down to the county level. It finds that climate change is affecting people’s security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority and Native American communities often disproportionately at risk. In Alaska, which is warming two to three times faster than the global average, reduced snowpack, shrinking glaciers, thawing permafrost, acidifying oceans and disappearing sea ice have affected everything from the state’s growing season, to hunting and fishing, with projections raising questions about whether some Indigenous communities should be relocated. The Southwest is experiencing more drought and extreme heat – including 31 consecutive days this summer whenPhoenix’s daily high temperaturesreached or exceeded 110 degrees – reducing water supplies and increasing wildfire risk. Northeastern cities are seeing more extreme heat, flooding and poor air quality, as well as risks to infrastructure, while drought and floods exacerbated by climate change threaten farming and ecosystems in rural areas. In the Midwest, both extreme drought and flooding threaten crops and animal production, which can affect the global food supply. In the northern Great Plains, weather extremes like drought and flooding, as well as declining water resources, threaten an economy dependent largely on crops, cattle, energy production and recreation. Meanwhile, water shortages in parts of the southern Great Plains are projected to worsen, while high temperatures are expected to break records in all three states by midcentury. In the Southeast, minority and Native American communities -- who may live in areas with higher exposures to extreme heat, pollution and flooding — have fewer resources to prepare for or to escape the effects of climate change. In the Northwest, hotter days and nights that don't cool down much have resulted in drier streams and less snowpack, leading to increased risk of drought and wildfires. The climate disturbance has also brought damaging extreme rain. Hawaii and other Pacific islands, as well as the U.S. Caribbean, are increasingly vulnerable to the extremes of drought and heavy rain as well as sea level rise and natural disaster as temperatures warm. Brown University climate scientist Kim Cobb, who wasn't part of the assessment team, said, “at the center of the report are people — across every region of the country - who have escalating risks associated with climate change as well as clear opportunities for win-win climate action.” The United States will warm in the future about 40% more than the world as a total, the assessment said. The AP calculated, usingothers'global projections, that would slate America to get about 3.8 degrees (2.1 degrees Celsius) hotter by the end of the century. Hotter average temperatures means weather that is even more extreme. “The news is not good, but it is also not surprising,” said University of Colorado's Waleed Abdalati, a former NASA chief scientist who was not part of this report. “What we are seeing is a manifestation of changes that were anticipated over the last few decades.” The 2,200-page report comes after five straight months when the globe set monthly and daily heat records. It comes as the U.S.has set a record with 25 different weatherdisasters this year that caused at least $1 billion in damage. “Climate change is finally moving from an abstract future issue to a present, concrete, relevant issue. It’s happening right now,” said report lead author Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy and a professor at Texas Tech University. Five years ago, when the last assessment was issued, fewer people were experiencing climate change firsthand. Surveys this year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research show that. In September, about 9 in 10 Americans (87%) said they'd experienced at least one extreme weather event in the past five years — drought, extreme heat, severe storms, wildfires or flooding. That was up from 79% who said that in April. Hayhoe said there's also a new emphasis in the assessment on marginalized communities. “It is less a matter ... of what hits where, but more what hits whom and how well those people can manage the impacts,” said University of Colorado's Abdalati, whose saw much of his neighborhood destroyed in the 2021 Marshall wildfire. Biden administration officials emphasize that all is not lost and the report details actions to reduce emissions and adapt to what's coming. Americans on every level of government are “stepping up to meet this moment,” said White House science adviser Arati Prabhakar. “All of these actions, taken together, give us hope because they tell us that we can do big things at the scale that’s required, at the scale that the climate actually notices.” By cleaning up industry, how electricity is made and how transport is powered, climate change can be dramatically reduced. Hausfather said when emissions stops, warming stops, ""so we can stop this acceleration if we as a society get our act together.” But some scientists said parts of the assessment are too optimistic. “The report's rosy graphics and outlook obscure the dangers approaching,” Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson said. “We are not prepared for what's coming.”","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'not found']",us,True,True

The double burden of dwindling availability - and inadequate water for drinking and sanitation services - is compounding the challenge, putting children at even greater risk. The Climate Changed Child - released ahead of the COP28 UN climate change summit later this month in Dubai - throws a spotlight on the threat facing vulnerable children. It provides an analysis of the impacts of three tiers of water security - water scarcity, water vulnerability, and what's termed ""water stress"" (where demand outstrips surface and groundwater supply) It also outlines the myriad ways in which children bear the brunt of the impacts of the climate crisis, including disease, air pollution, and extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. From the moment of conception, child development is impacted by environmental stress factors, the agency said. 'Uniquely vulnerable' For example, children are more likely to suffer from air pollution than adults. ""The consequences of climate change are devastating for children,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. ""Their bodies and minds are uniquely vulnerable to polluted air, poor nutrition and extreme heat. ""Not only is their world changing - with water sources drying up and terrifying weather events becoming stronger and more frequent - so too is their well-being as climate change affects their mental and physical health. Children are demanding change, but their needs are far too often relegated to the sidelines."" According to the report, the largest number of youngsters are exposed in the Middle East and North Africa and South Asia regions - meaning they live in places with limited water resources and high levels of seasonal and interannual variability, ground water decline or drought risk. East Africa: grim outlook for millions going hungry, warns WFP In East Africa, conflict, high food prices and climate shocks continue to leave millions of people not knowing where their next meal will come from, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) warned on Monday. The agency said that as of the end of September 62.6 million in the region were food insecure, with Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan among the ""most severe"" global food crises. All four countries have been experiencing either open conflict or heightened violence, pushing people to flee their homes. Over 18 million people in the region are displaced - including12 million within their countries and five million who have crossed international borders. Inflation over 13% High costs of food and of living persist in East Africa with inflation averaging 13.2 per cent. WFP said that while official inflation rates for war-torn Sudan have not been issued since February, ""they are expected to exceed 300 per cent by the end of the year"". The UN agency stressed that the dire situation is likely to continue through early 2024. The El Niño climate pattern is expected to bring above-normal rainfall through January, which can be a boon for farming; however, WFP warned that severe flooding in low-lying areas of Somalia, Ethiopia and Uganda may threaten crops and livestock, drive further displacement and fuel infectious disease outbreaks. Iraq: UN migration agency welcomes new Yazidi Genocide Memorial In Iraq, the UN migration agency IOM has hailed a new memorial in Sinjar province at a site where scores of Yazidi women were killed by terror group ISIL in 2014 as a ""first step towards recovery"". Built at the request of survivors by Nadia's Initiative - an organization spearheaded by survivor and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Nadia Murad, together with IOM - the memorial pays homage to the resilience and courage of the Yazidis. Over 3,000 were executed and buried in mass graves by ISIL, also known as Daesh, in what the UN has declared a genocide. Ms. Murad, whose own mother was killed at the site, had donated part of her prize to purchase the land that the memorial stands on. 'Survivors law' IOM's chief of mission in Iraq, Giorgi Gigauri, said that a crucial part of the recovery process was timely individual reparations and other transitional justice measures as outlined in the ""Yazidi Survivors Law"" adopted by the Iraqi parliament in 2021. The UN agency worked closely with the Iraqi authorities to develop the law and has been supporting the application process for reparations. Over 1,140 applications have already been processed and nearly 900 verified survivors have begun receiving monthly salaries under the legislation.","['unitedarabemirates', 'spain', 'sweden', 'sweden', 'sweden', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'southsudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'uganda', 'iraq', 'iraq', 'iraq', 'syria', 'india', 'france', 'not found', 'georgia']",us,False,False

The assessment, produced about every four years, lays out the toll climate change is taking across every region in the United States. This is the fifth one — but for the first time, this year’s report includes chapters dedicated to economic impact and social inequities. As floods, fires, heatwaves, and other calamities tied to climate change intensify, households pay the price with higher costs and worsening environmental injustices. As floods, fires, heatwaves, and other calamities tied to climate change intensify, households pay the price with higher costs and worsening environmental injustices Climate change has created circumstances that the planet hasn’t seen for thousands of years, the report says. Global temperatures have risen faster over the past half-century than they have in at least 2,000 years. That’s led to all sorts of new threats, like the 2021 heatwave that killed more than 1,400 people in the typically temperate Pacific Northwest. And old problems get much bigger, like droughts sucking the Southwest dry. Drought in the Western US is currently more severe than it’s ever been in at least 1,200 years. Since 1980, drought and heatwaves alone have caused more than $320 billion in damages. Extreme weather disasters make up some of the most devastating displays of climate change and are becoming way more common — and more costly. Back in the 1980s, a billion-dollar disaster hit the US once every four months on average (a figure that’s adjusted for inflation). Now, the US has to cope with one every three weeks. Those extreme events come with $150 billion in losses every year, according to the assessment. That’s a “conservative estimate that does not account for loss of life, healthcare-related costs, or damages to ecosystem services,” the report says. Related We only get one planet Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm on cleaning up ‘clean’ energy There are also more insidious ways climate change takes a bite out of the US economy. Consumers have to shell out more money for food and other goods as prices reflect damages caused by climate change. In the Midwest, pests, diseases, and whiplash between wet and dry conditions linked to climate change threaten corn and apple harvests. And climate change has already supercharged 18 major fishery disasters in Alaska “that were especially damaging for coastal Indigenous Peoples, subsistence fishers, and rural communities,” according to the report. None of these challenges are happening in a vacuum. Like pollution, climate disasters disproportionately affect Americans of color, low-income households, and other groups that have been historically marginalized. While 20 to 40 percent of small businesses that shutter after a natural disaster never open their doors again, those owned by women, people of color, and veterans are even more likely to close for good. Flood losses are expected to balloon much faster in communities with a higher proportion of Black residents Flood losses are expected to balloon much faster in communities with a higher proportion of Black residents. Census tracts where at least 20 percent of the population is Black are projected to see average annual losses from floods rise at a rate twice as fast as other census tracks where less than 1 percent of the population is Black. It’s partly a symptom of racist housing policies like redlining that have left certain communities without the infrastructure and resources to cope with hazards brought on by climate change. Formerly redlined neighborhoods can also be around 12 degrees hotter than surrounding areas because of fewer green spaces and more paved surfaces that trap heat. All of these risks grow as long as the US, the world’s biggest oil and gas producer, and other countries keep running on fossil fuels. The world has warmed by a little more than 1 degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution, and the report says 2 degrees of warming would more than double the economic toll from climate change. The US isn’t taking action fast enough to stop that outcome, the report shows. Planet-heating pollution in the US has only fallen by an average of about 1 percent annually since 2005. It needs to drop by more than 6 percent per year to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which commits countries to keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.

As a result, we are facing many of the same challenges as other staffing firms, especially in the area of light industrial. At the same time, workers compensation costs and a weaker permanent placement/direct hire market have contributed to softer margins,” said Brendan Flood, Chairman, CEO and President. “We are continuing to carefully monitor the markets in which we operate so that we are well prepared as the economy recovers,” concluded Flood.

Derna, Libya– About a month after floods devastated Libya’s eastern city of Derna, Dr Khaled al-Shaari was discovered by his neighbours. He had taken his own life near his flood-ravaged home. His death was not an isolated event. In the weeks following the catastrophe, 25 other Derna residents have died by suicide. Al-Shaari, 38, had been suffering psychological trauma after losing both his family and home after the two dams in Derna broke on September 10, explained his neighbour, Mohammed Rifaeira. “He couldn’t bear the shock he faced and found no mental support even a month after the catastrophe,” Rifaei told Al Jazeera. Other neighbours had seen al-Shaari sitting by the door of his ruined home, waiting for news about relatives swept away by the floods. Once a busy urban hub, Derna and its streets now carry the scars of the overwhelming damage that 30 million cubic metres of rushing water can inflict: buildings crumbled, windows shattered, walls discoloured. Homes and all sense of place were destroyed in the flood, which claimed as many as 11,300 lives. Muddy handprints of the rescue and relief workers are still visible on bare walls. The damage extends beyond structures. The faces of the survivors, etched with trauma, are bitter testaments to the horror of what they experienced. And help is hard to find. Before the flood, 31-year-old Layla Eljerbi was an art teacher. She lived with her family in a small apartment, its walls decorated with her and her students’ artwork, close to the heart of the city. Her flat was among the first to be hit. “Within moments, it was like my entire life washed away in front of me. The artworks, the photographs, the memories – all gone,” she recalled. Her struggle continues. “Each night is a battle with sleep; each raindrop is a reminder of the deluge that washed away my life and artwork. Even though I escaped the flood, I’m drowning every day in my mind,” Layla said. Since the flood, Layla has had acute anxiety. Her hands tremble when the sky darkens and she avoids passing by rivers or any significant stretch of water. Her diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one shared by countless others who were impacted by the catastrophic floods. However, with mental health services in short supply, Layla has struggled to find help. She attends group therapy sessions organised by volunteers but admits it is a far cry from the specialised care she needs. In Derna, medical clinics focus more on physical injuries and diseases, rather than mental health. “The government needs to realise that the catastrophe is far from over. In many ways, it’s just beginning,” Layla said. As winter approaches, the potential for further rains and floods leads to fear and anxiety. Abdulaziz al-Huni is a member of the Libyan Goodness Team which offers free psychological support to flood survivors. He admits to feeling overwhelmed. “We’re doing our best, but the scale of the need is overwhelming and resources are thin,” he said. There are nearly 600 displaced families now living in the eastern city of Tobruk, about 67km (42 miles) to the southeast. About 285 families are in the capital, Tripoli, which is 1345km (836 miles) away. These households all rely upon aid provided by local merchants. The mental health of displaced people is one of the main factors overlooked by authorities in the wake of any crisis, psychiatrists say. Integrating into new locations can be socially and psychologically challenging. This can exacerbate existing trauma and lead to mental illness or even suicide. Children’s mental health has also been affected. Dr Marwa al-Saadawi, a psychiatrist at Tobruk Hospital, recalls a young child who came to the hospital struggling to breathe. There was no physical explanation for his symptoms, she explained, “but he mentioned waking up from a dream where he was drowning, causing him distress”. There is a “huge need for psychological treatment … but we are in a crisis and are prioritising those most affected,” al-Saadawi acknowledges. “Sometimes, [travelling to] affected people is a challenge, but volunteer teams are doing their best,” she said. Still, no matter how hard her teams work, they cannot address the overwhelming need for support. With Libya splintered between two rival parliaments, funding for Derna’s reconstruction is equally fractured. The eastern House of Representatives has allocated 10 billion dinars ($2bn), and the western Government of National Unity has made a smaller contribution. But how these funds will be disbursed and utilised has not been confirmed. Residents who have returned to a devastated Derna say their governments have abandoned them; weeks after the flood, conditions in the area are still dire. Social affairs journalist Iman al-Sweihli, who has been covering the fallout from the floods, said neither government has tackled the issue and called for them to “address it courageously” before it turns into a “disaster”. Several attempts have been made to communicate the conditions of the displaced families to both governments, explained Faraj Abu al-Khattabiya, the mayor of Tobruk, over the phone. However, there has been no response to calls for help. Many of the displaced families suffer from acute anxiety, fear and an inability to process the trauma they experienced, according to al-Khattabiya.

Stalin, who took stock of the situation and visited the Emergency Operations Centre at Ezhilagam inChennaion Tuesday, interacted with the district collectors and asked them to be prepared with all requisite measures like ensuring civic amenities at relief camps established to accommodate people in case of any inundation. The ministers have been asked to visit coastal areas like Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, and Mayiladuthurai districts to carry out necessary measures. With few districts along the coastal areas and others including Tiruvallur having declared holiday for both schools and colleges on Wednesday due to rainfall, only schools were shut in Chennai. The district collector of Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram announced educational institutions will continue to run as usual.

Now 48, Adachi still cares deeply for his birds, drawing them out of their baskets each morning and stroking their long necks to confirm their health and maintain a bond. “For me, cormorants are my partners,” he said. Adachi is the 18th generation of his family to be a master cormorant fisherman and one of about 50 people in Japan carrying on the 1,300-year tradition of using trained birds to dive for fish. It is considered the ideal way to catch the sweet ayu river fish, and his family has a hereditary mandate to supply the delicacy to the Japanese imperial household. The method, known as ukai, was once common in Japan and a version of it has also been practised in China. But today it is largely supported by tourists, who watch the fishermen and their birds bringing in the catch. Now, environmental changes are making the fish ever more scarce and small, endangering the lifeline of the fisherman, known as usho, and their flocks. “I go to the river every day so I can feel the changes,” Adachi said, drawing upon nearly four decades of working on the Nagara River in Oze, a town in central Gifu prefecture. Come sundown between May and October, he boards a boat along with an assistant, a steersman, and about 10 cormorants leashed at the neck and body. A basket of flames swings out over the dark river, waking the ayu from resting spots among the stones below. The cormorants catch them as they dart away, but the leash keeps the larger fish from going down the birds’ gullets. The birds are coaxed to release the fish into a bucket. And from a nearby observation boat, tourists take in the spectacle of splashing feathers and dancing fire. As is common these days, the haul is tiny. Guests at a traditional ryokan inn run by the Adachi family are fed salted, grilled ayu, but it is supplied by a local fishmonger. Adachi ascribes the dearth of fish to the weather, which he says has become more unpredictable, with heavier rains and flooding on the once calm river. And construction of flood barriers has led to smaller rocks and sand filling the river bottom, obstructing the larger rocks that form the ayu’s habitat. “In the past, there were only big boulders, but now they’re small,” he said. “The sand and gravel has increased, and along with that the ayu have gotten smaller too.” Environmental studies have confirmed his concerns. Temperatures in the Nagara River have risen to a high of 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), delaying the spawning period of the ayu by a month, said Gifu University associate professor Morihiro Harada. The fish like to eat algae that grow on large stones, Harada said, but those rocks have become less common after repeated anti-flooding works carried out by river management authorities. Down river from Oze, the usho of Gifu City has a larger, more tourism-oriented operation. Fleets of boats allow visitors to eat and drink as they watch the fishermen and birds. The same environmental shifts also affect this business, with rough waters sometimes pushing the tourist boats off course or leading to cancellations. To contend with the growing number of lost business days, an economic development body known as ORGAN set up an elevated riverside viewing deck on a trial basis, attempting to recreate the boat experience in evenings hosted by apprentice geishas and other traditional performers. “We wanted to offer a more refined, higher-quality experience,” said ORGAN leader Yusuke Kaba. Facing an uncertain future, Adachi can only honour the past and tend to the present. In his home, he prays before shrines dedicated to his usho ancestors. And in the yard, he tends to his 16 birds, one by one. His son Toichiro helps out on the boat and is training to become the next master fisherman. Toichiro wants to carry on the tradition. But for now, the 22-year-old spends his days working with a computer at a maker of high-precision machine tools, the type of industry that transformed Japan’s economy and society in the post-war period. “I want my son to inherit my job, but it’s tough to make a living,” Adachi said. “If we cannot catch fish any more, our motivation is gone and there’s no meaning in what we do.” Follow Al Jazeera English:","['japan', 'japan', 'japan', 'japan', 'japan', 'japan', 'japan', 'japan', 'japan', 'china']",us,False,False

The end of over two years of drought that pushed the country to the brink of famine has brought little relief for families. Floods - by some estimates the worst in decades - have driven close to half a million people from their homes and crippled families' attempts to rebuild their drought-ravaged livelihoods. ""The most vulnerable people in Somalia have been hit once again by climate change. With these floods following right after the drought, it feels like a relentless bombardment of climate shocks for struggling families,"" said Laura Turner, WFP Somalia Deputy Country Director. ""Humanitarian aid brought people back from the brink of starvation in 2022, but Somalia is still facing the highest levels of hunger it has suffered in over a decade. We need to provide communities with the tools and knowledge to weather these extremes to break the crisis-driven cycle of hunger that has afflicted Somalia for too long."" In October, as ominous weather forecasts predicted heavy rain and floods exacerbated by El Niño weather pattern, WFP activated a flood anticipatory action programme - its first in Africa - in coordination with the Government of Somalia. WFP delivered pre-emptive cash transfers and warning messages in districts projected to suffer heavy flooding, reaching over 200,000 people so far. The total disbursement under the programme will be US$4.1 million. WFP also pre-positioned boats in key locations to support food delivery when the floods hit. ""We heard the message that the floods were coming. We heard it several times while we stayed in the flood zones,"" Meymuna Ali, a resident of a flood zone in Beletweyne on the Shabelle River, told WFP last week. ""The message helped us [prepare to] evacuate. God willing, we will move."" The floods hit along the Juba river in early November, in areas such as Luuq and Baardheere,where a key bridge was swept away. Areas along the Shabelle River, including Beletweyne, were inundated over the weekend leaving communities battling to save their homes, livestock, and crops. The anticipatory action programmes in these areas meant that families had the information and means to protect their homes or move before the floods hit, leaving fewer people now in need of emergency assistance. But with a quarter of Somalia's population - 4.3 million people - forecast to face crisis-level hunger or worse (IPC3+) by the end of the year, the support of the humanitarian community remains a lifeline. The floods have exacerbated Somalia's hunger crisis, at a time when significant funding shortfalls mean that WFP is only able to provide food assistance to less than half of the people most in need. Without additional funding, WFP will struggle to scale anticipatory action programmes or make longer-term investments to build resilience, enable Somalia to adapt to these increasingly severe climate shocks and break the cycle of crisis-driven dependence on humanitarian aid. WFP's funding gap in Somalia is US$ 378 million from November 2023 to April 2024. # # # The United Nations World Food Programme is the world's largest humanitarian organization saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.","['somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'southsudan']",us,False,False

Ambassadors met for their annual briefing with the heads of UN Police Components serving at field missions. Approximately 9,000 police officers - men and women - from 94 countries are deployed at UN peace operations, mainly in formed police units (FPUs) comprised of 140 members. Unique responses required Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, opened the meeting by highlighting the importance of continuously enhancing and adapting peacekeeping to match changing conditions. ""Many challenges to global peace, security and development today - such as, a global decline in respect for the rule of law, corruption, disregard for international law, transnational organized crime, attacks on human rights, and the shrinking of the civic space - all call for unique and specific policing responses,"" he said. Mr. Lacroix recalled that the latest report on the overall performance of UN peacekeeping operations highlights a gap between their mandates and what they can actually deliver. For some missions, the gap has become ""quite significant"", he added. In response, the UN will continue to strengthen effectiveness through its Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) agenda, particularly the A4P+ strategy. Priorities include ensuring coherence behind political strategies, and greater strategic and operational integration. Council support critical However, ""there is only so much that UN Peacekeeping operations can achieve alone,"" he cautioned. ""Violent conflict is increasing in many parts of the world. And the number, intensity and length of conflicts worldwide is at its highest level since before the end of the Cold War. This is all amidst heightened geopolitical tensions, including in this Council,"" he said. As a result, UN operations can only achieve what he called the ""immediate goals"" of peacekeeping, such as preserving ceasefires, protecting civilians, mediating local conflicts and strengthening institutions, where possible. ""These are very important goals of course, but the ultimate objective of UN Peacekeeping is to achieve durable political solutions to conflict,"" he said. ""Without the unified political support of Member States and particularly the Security Council for political solutions where our missions are deployed, we can only serve to mitigate rather than resolve conflicts."" Action in the CAR The annual meeting provides an opportunity to reaffirm the vital role that UN Police (UNPOL) play across what he called ""the conflict prevention spectrum"", spanning from peacekeeping to peacebuilding. Commissioner Christophe Bizimungu showcased the achievements of UNPOL serving with the UN Mission in the Central African Republic, MINUSCA, who have been strengthening the capacities of the internal security forces (ISF), comprising the local police and gendarmerie. Officers have been working in three specific areas: training and technical assistance, infrastructure and equipment support, and institutional support. Their impact has been significant, he said. For example, ISF were largely absent across the country five years ago and unable to provide basic services to the population. Today, they are present and operational in the capital, Bangui, and in large swathes of the territory. ""We have noted real improvement of public order and in terms of controlling crime within the country,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter. Gender in focus The Police Commissioner at the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) stressed the need for gender-responsive policing during conflict and in the face of new and emerging threats. ""Amidst a challenging global geopolitical environment, threats such as gender discrimination, adverse climate events such as flooding and droughts, climate-related conflict, and food insecurity have become more entrenched and disproportionately affect women and girls,"" Christine Fossen told the Council. She gave examples from the field, such as the situation in Bentiu where four years of incessant rain, flooding and the resultant limited access to firewood and livelihood support for women coincided with a spike in reports of sexual and gender-based violence. ""As we continue to experience clear linkages between extreme weather patterns and gender it is apparent that we must enhance our understanding of these new dimensions as well as the nature of our policing response, including training, sensitization, and trust-building,"" she said. What UN Police needs UNPOL have continued to improve the lives of the people in the countries where they are deployed but achieving their goals requires greater support from the Security Council, UN Police Adviser Faisal Shakhar said in his briefing. He stressed the critical need for officers with expertise in countering organized crime, including environmental crime and terrorism; forensics; crime analysis; community-oriented policing; sexual and gender-based violence; gender mainstreaming; and improvised explosive device risk awareness and mitigation. FPUs require more French-speaking officers and mixed-gender units, available for rapid deployment and equipped with state-of-the-art capabilities including SWAT (special weapons and tactics), rapid reaction, canine and riverine elements. Police teams specializing in community-oriented policing, environmental crimes, public order management, border policing and forensics, are also wanted. ""To further the digital transformation of peacekeeping, we will require social media monitoring and analysis tools for use as early warning mechanisms; aerostat and live high resolution video feed capabilities; and personnel who are proficient in data analytics and management, cybercrime investigations and cyber security,"" he added. Shakhar concluded his remarks by underscoring that ""sustained leadership and continued political engagement of Member States are indispensable for the success of the United Nations policing.""","['not found', 'centralafricanrepublic', 'southsudan']",us,False,False

Since 2018, cities in every region have ramped up their efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change.Still, the effects of climate change that are being experienced already today—more damaging storms, deadly heat waves and floods—are ""likely unprecedented over thousands of years."" They are touching everything, fromeconomic securitytohuman health, with underserved communities often harmed the most. And while no part of the country has been unscathed, few are as vulnerable to the worsening effects as the Southeast.Those are among the main findings from the Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5), a sweeping federalreportthat provides a comprehensive look at how the country is being affected by climate change and what it is doing to respond.Katherine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and one of the authors of the assessment, said ""too many people still think of climate change as an issue that's distant from us in space or time or relevance.""""[The report] shows us how—if we live in the U.S.—the risks matter, and so to do our choices,"" Hayhoe added.More than 500 authors and 260 contributors worked on this edition, including several from Georgia. The last report was released in 2018 during the Trump administration, but much has changed since then.In 2021, under President Joe Biden's administration, the U.S. re-entered the Paris Climate Agreement, the international pact that seeks to limit global warming. With the votes of Democrats in Congress, Biden also passed his signature climate and health care law—the Inflation Reduction Act—which offers billions in tax credits and incentives to help the U.S. transition toclean energy, plus funding to help communities adapt.Here's what the report says about how Georgia is faring as the planet heats up.Dangerous heat on the riseAtlanta now sees around eight more extreme heat days that it did 1961, according to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which oversaw the assessment. The city's ""heat wave season"" has also lengthened by more than 80 days.And while scientists have long known that emissions of greenhouse gases are increasing the intensity and frequency of heat waves, the report finds the Southeast is among the most vulnerable regions to these events.Underlying health issues like diabetes and heart disease are known to increase vulnerability to heat illness, and the assessment notes Southerners consistently rank among the most unhealthy in the country, with shorter-than-average life expectancies. The Southeast is also home to more Black residents than any other region of the country who ""shoulder a disproportionate level of health risk associated with climate change.""While the region has not seen a jump in days over 95 degrees like other parts of the country, it has seen an increase in nighttime temperatures. On average, the Southeast now sees almost eight more days with overnight temperatures above 70 degrees than it did between 1901 and 1960, the report found.High overnight temperatures rob the body of the cooling-off period it needs to stay safe during the day, with those living in poorly insulated homes or unhoused facing the greatest risk. Adding to the problem in heavily paved cities like Atlanta areurban heat islands, which can be as much as 12 degrees warmer than surrounding areas in a heat wave, the authors write.Evan Mallen, a senior analyst at Georgia Tech's Urban Climate Lab and a technical contributor to the assessment, said the report makes clear that heat does not affect everyone equally.""I think that when it comes to both the city and the state, we should be thinking about how we address these challenges in a way that is equitable,"" he said.More flooding on the coast—and inlandAs Earth's glaciers and ice sheets melt, the report findssea level riseis accelerating on Georgia's 100-mile-long coast and elsewhere in the Southeast.Though exact amounts vary by location, tide gauges along the Southeast coast show sea levels rose by roughly six inches between 1970 and 2020, the report finds, with a significant uptick in just the last three decades. Parts of the Southeast could face sea levels that are 16 to 23 inches higher than they were in 2000 by 2050, less than 30 years from now.As a result, the report says high-tide flooding events could become five to 10 times more common than they are today, threatening to coastal communities.Areas farther inland face a growing flood risk, too.Heavy deluges are occurring more frequently and becoming more intense, the assessment found. In the Southeast, the heaviest 1% of precipitation events now dump 37% more rain than they did in the middle of the 20th century. Only the Northeast and Midwest have seen larger increases.Those events can quickly overwhelm urban stormwater systems, just as one did in Atlanta in September, causing damaging flooding in parts of downtown.Warmer winters, failing cropsFarming is the lifeblood of many rural communities and an economic driver in Georgia, worth an estimated $74 billion of total economic impact each year.But farmers in Georgia are already having trouble bringing their crops to harvest. An exceptionally warm winter followed by a March freeze wiped out nearly all of the state's peach crop this year, and blueberry farmers have endured similar losses. Then, just over two months ago, Hurricane Idalia downed tens of thousands of pecan trees in South Georgia.Those problems—and others—are likely to grow as the planet warms, the assessment found.The report says higher temperatures, especially overnight, are already reducing farmers' yields, with impacts set to worsen as the heat increases. Long-term droughts are expected to grow more intense, and warmer conditions will allow pests to invade new areas.Pam Knox, an agricultural climatologist at UGA and one of the authors of the Southeast chapter of the report, said there is reason for hope that farmers can adjust to the changes. Modern techniques like precision farming—data-driven technologies that help farmers to use resources, like water and fertilizer, as efficiently as possible—are catching on and growing cheaper.""The more we know, the more we can figure out ways to adapt and change our management style to deal with a challenge,"" Knox said.'Hope and possibilities' existThe report does not mince words: There is not a pocket of the U.S. that has been left untouched by climate change, and the effects are likely to get worse. But how much worse depends on the actions we take today, the authors write.There are promising signs that the country and the rest of the world are making progress in the fight to reduce emissions.The price of solar panels has dropped 90% since 2010, while other clean energy technologies—from batteries to wind turbines—have gotten cheaper, too. Local efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt toclimate changeare taking place in every part of the country and have increased substantially since the last national assessment in 2018.Plus, the technologies needed to decarbonize the economy—fromelectric vehiclesandsolar powerto energy-efficient appliances and techniques to reduce food waste—already exist. With EV, battery and solar plants coming online in Georgia, the state is set to play a major role in providing those technologies to the U.S. and global markets.""The takeaway from this assessment—the takeaway from all of our collective work onclimate—should not be doom and despair,"" said Ali Zaidi, the White House's National Climate Advisor.

In a statement issued by his Spokesperson, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was ""deeply disturbed by the horrible situation and dramatic loss of life"" reported in Gaza's medical facilities.""In the name of humanity, the Secretary-General calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", the statement reiterated. Suffering exacerbated ""Rain will just add further to the suffering"" of people in the Strip, WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris told reporters earlier in Geneva, at a time when disruptions in sewage pumping and water shortages have caused a spike in waterborne diseases and bacterial infections. The World Health Organization warned last week that since mid-October, over 33,500 cases of diarrhoea have been reported, mostly among children under five, some 16 times the monthly average. Facilities run by the UN agency for Palestine refugees, UNRWA, where over 580,000 displaced people in southern Gaza had sought shelter due to Israel's offensive in retaliation for Hamas' deadly 7 October attacks, are more than nine times over capacity and the overcrowding is posing further health risks. ""We are begging for a ceasefire to happen now,"" Dr. Harris insisted. Hostages' families in Geneva Meanwhile in Geneva, the families of some of the 238 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza since 7 October were due to continue their advocacy for the release of their loved ones on Tuesday. A meeting was announced between hostages' families and Mirjana Spoljaric, President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a UN humanitarian partner organisation. In a statement, the ICRC said that Ms. Spoljaric would also meet with the Israeli authorities and that the organisation has been ""persistently advocating on behalf of the hostages held in Gaza, including directly with Hamas and with actors who may have influence on the parties"". Health workers 'doing whatever they can' WHO's Dr. Harris described in detail the dire situation at Al-Shifa hospital, which is a focus of operations by the Israeli Defense Forces which claim that Hamas had established a command centre under the hospital - an allegation denied by medical staff. Speaking of the ""heroic"" health workers, Dr. Harris said that they are ""doing whatever they can to keep going"" while the facility has been without power since 11 November and there was not enough food and clean water. Some 700 patients were still present at the site and more than 400 health staff, in addition to around 3,000 displaced persons who had sought refuge there. Dr. Harris said that 20 patient deaths have been reported in the last 48 hours. As many as six premature babies had reportedly died at Al-Shifa over the past three days as their incubators were unable to function owing to the lack of electricity. Evacuation 'very difficult' Asked about the possibility of evacuating patients, Dr. Harris explained that all of those remaining at Al-Shifa required critical support to stay alive. Moving them ""would be a very difficult thing to ask in the best circumstances"", Dr. Harris said, let alone amid bombing, armed clashes and a lack of fuel for ambulances. ""The best way would be to stop the hostilities right now and focus on saving lives, not taking lives,"" she insisted. Record number of attacks on healthcare Some 135 attacks on health facilities have been documented in Gaza over the course of the past month, and WHO's Dr. Harris said that this was the highest number recorded in such a short amount of time. ""I hope this is the worst we ever see,"" she said. The WHO spokesperson pointed to an ""increasing trend"" of attacks on health care, also seen in other ongoing conflicts in Sudan and in Ukraine. ""It seems that somehow the understanding that a hospital must a safe haven, a place where people come to be treated when they are in need, has been forgotten,"" she told journalists.","['turkmenistan', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'switzerland', 'switzerland', 'switzerland', 'israel', 'sudan', 'ukraine']",us,False,False

But … [+3489 chars]",Food,"The number of extra homes to be protected from flooding in England has been cut by almost half. The government had committed to better protecting 336,000 more properties between 2021 and 2027. But a report by the National Audit Office (NAO) says this was reduced to 200,000, a cut of 40%, with inflation cited as the major reason. The government says it is delivering record investment in flood protection. The reduction of the pledge, made in 2020, comes despite inflation falling to its lowest rate in two years, and recent storms that have caused widespread damage and flooding across the UK. Storm Debi brought heavy rain and strong winds to several regions this week, and earlier this month Storm Ciarán lashed the UK and parts of the British Isles, causing flooding, severe damage to properties, and travel disruption. Storm Ciarán came hot on the heels of Storm Babet in October, which killed three people in the UK amid widespread flooding and disruption. The UK's public spending watchdog also said the Environment Agency had removed 500 of the 2,000 new flood defence projects originally included in the government's six-year flood and coastal erosion programme - despite the government doubling capital funding for the programme to £5.2bn. Meanwhile 203,000 properties that already have flood protection face an increased risk because of a £34m shortfall in the Environment Agency's maintenance funding for 2022-23, the report said. There was also an underspend of £310m when it came to investing in new projects during the first two years of the capital programme. The NAO warned that due to underspending in the first two years, an average of almost £1bn will need to be spent each year over the remaining four years to spend the full £5.2bn. It said this creates a risk for projects to be accelerated or new projects to be introduced too quickly, leading to delays or cost overruns, as the agency strives to meet this level of investment. The NAO recommended The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), the Environment Agency and the Treasury work together to ensure that decisions on the capital programme are focused on maximising value for money. The government has not set a target for the level of flood resilience it expects to achieve and has not mapped out any solid plans beyond 2026 to bridge the gap between its shorter-term actions and long-term objectives, the report noted. Tom Lancaster, land analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said recent storms have brought flooding to the top of the political agenda, and that the NAO's report revealed England is ""well off the pace in using the power of nature to protect homes and communities"". ""Restoring sponge-like peatlands can keep water in the hills and out of living rooms, and new woodlands and wetlands will slow the flow and absorb carbon, mitigating as well as adapting to climate change,"" he said. A Defra spokesperson said the government's priority is to make the difficult but necessary long-term decisions for the country. ""As has already been set out in the Environment Agency's annual report, inflationary pressures and delays brought about by the pandemic mean we must look again at the targets set out in our £5.2bn programme,"" they said. ""We will consider the National Audit Office's recommendations as we continue to deliver our record investment to protect hundreds of thousands of homes from floods.""","['unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'unitedstates', 'not found']",gb,True,False

The gruesome sight has haunted residents like Ayaan Mohamed, who lives near the graveyard. ""Seven families including mine have fled the neighbourhood,"" she told the BBC. With houses partially submerged and human remains floating nearby, they fear an outbreak of disease, she says. Some of the bodies were recognisable, further traumatising people - and as the water has subsided unearthed bones have also been found. ""The floods revealed the remains of a highly esteemed Muslim cleric. He was laid to rest 18 years ago,"" Ms Mohamed said. ""His students and other clerics attempted to gather the remains,"" she said, but they were unable to do so. These are scenes the city has never witnessed before. At least 32 people have been killed across the country and the UN warns that more than 1.6 million people could be affected in the devastating floods which follow years of drought. The situation in Galkayo is not as a severe as in the Gedo region of southern Somalia, where the River Juba has burst its banks and swept away a key bridge in the city of Bardere. It was overwhelmed by floodwaters and collapsed on Saturday. Mohamed Abdirahin says almost all the city's residents have been forced to move to the outskirts. The 70-year-old was a prosperous merchant and farmer until last week. ""I left everything behind,"" he told the BBC. ""I salvaged what I could with my bare hands from my shop - the rest was swept away by the water. It's like my life ended like that,"" Mr Abdirahin says. He is finding it hard to come to terms with how swiftly his life was transformed as floodwaters first inundated his shop, then brought down his home. Mr Abdirahin also had a farm just outside the city, where he went to check on his mature fruit trees after his family were forced to leave their compound in the city. He had been hoping for a bountiful harvest at the end of January, but that dream has been swept away along with the fruit. ""The 10m- (32ft-) high mango trees had almost sunk when we were leaving, I couldn't see anything standing on my land,"" Mr Abdirahin said. One part of the city, which is on higher ground, has been spared, but it has become inaccessible by road without the bridge. It is a vital lifeline for all those that have lost their homes as the district has food stores and a health care centre. People have to use small boats to reach there. ""We wait more than four hours for those boats to go and get for us something to eat,"" Mr Abdirahin said. Somalia's fragile, UN-backed government has been trying to provide emergency relief, but it says it cannot cover all the affected areas. ""For the last five days, we have supplied many materials for those in need - the current situation has overwhelmed the government capabilities,"" Somalia's Deputy Prime Minister Salah Jama told the BBC. Another problem is that some areas are not in the hands of the government and are controlled by the al-Qaeda-linked group al-Shabab. The Somali Disaster Management Agency (Sodma) says it has been receiving regular calls from people living in al-Shabab territory, but it is not able to help as it would be too dangerous for officials to venture there. In some cities people whose houses are still standing have been told to take in those who have been made homeless - and some communities have been clubbing together to cook meals for one another. When the long-awaited rainy season arrives in Somalia - it is usually a time for celebration, symbolising prosperity to come, especially when the country has been increasingly experiencing droughts. People often venture outdoors to explore the ponds and watering holes that fill up and sometimes even go swimming. The niece and daughter of Anab Deerow, who lives in El-Wak west of Bardere on the border with Kenya, went out to have fun after a heavy downpour. Ms Deerow said the two girls had been so excited as they had just finished their exams and it was the first day of their holidays before starting senior school next year. The cousins had been playing outside for a few hours, taking selfies and had just clambered down to see a pool in a small valley outside the town when a torrent of water swept them away. Ms Deerow's eight-year-old daughter witnessed it and came screaming home to tell her. The girls' lifeless bodies were found later following a long search after the water had subsided. ""They had returned from school a day before they died. I'm at a loss for words. It seems the angel of death called them out,"" Ms Deerow told the BBC. The heavy rainfall and floods are expected to continue until the end of November, according to Sodma. As well as those who have had to leave their homes, 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million acres) of farmland could potentially be destroyed, the UN warns. The thought of more rain falling is terrifying for many people already struggling to find food and clean water. Mr Abdirahin and his family of 12 now find themselves sleeping in the dense bush land outside Bardere, where they have been for more than a week. ""We are totally lost in the bushes,"" he said, becoming overwhelmed with emotion. ""We are just alive for no reason. We are terrified. Just waiting for help from God.""

Suffering exacerbated ""Rain will just add further to the suffering"" of people in the Strip, WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris told reporters earlier in Geneva, at a time when disruptions in sewage pumping and water shortages have caused a spike in waterborne diseases and bacterial infections. The World Health Organization warned last week that since mid-October, over 33,500 cases of diarrhoea have been reported, mostly among children under five, some 16 times the monthly average. Facilities run by the UN agency for Palestine refugees, UNRWA, where over 580,000 displaced people in southern Gaza had sought shelter due to Israel's offensive in retaliation for Hamas' deadly 7 October attacks, are more than nine times over capacity and the overcrowding is posing further health risks. ""We are begging for a ceasefire to happen now,"" Dr. Harris insisted. Fuel depot 'now empty' In a statement late on Monday, the UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini, said that the humanitarian response was ""gradually coming to an end because no fuel has been allowed into the Gaza Strip since 7 October."" Since the seige of Gaza began UNRWA has heavily rationed the use of fuel and accessed pre-existing, limited amounts stored in a depot inside the Gaza Strip, through close coordination with Israeli Authorities. ""The depot is now empty"", the UNRWA chief said. ""It is very simple. Without fuel, the humanitarian operation in Gaza is coming to an end. Many more people will suffer and will likely die. It is unbelievable that humanitarian agencies have to beg for fuel and operate on life support"", he added. ""Since the beginning of the war, fuel has been used as a weapon of war and this should stop immediately."" Hostages' families in Geneva Meanwhile in Geneva, the families of some of the 238 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza since 7 October were due to continue their advocacy for the release of their loved ones on Tuesday. A meeting was announced between hostages' families and Mirjana Spoljaric, President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a UN humanitarian partner organisation. In a statement, the ICRC said that Ms. Spoljaric would also meet with the Israeli authorities and that the organisation has been ""persistently advocating on behalf of the hostages held in Gaza, including directly with Hamas and with actors who may have influence on the parties"". Health workers 'doing whatever they can' WHO's Dr. Harris described in detail the dire situation at Al-Shifa hospital, which is a focus of operations by the Israeli Defense Forces which claim that Hamas had established a command centre under the hospital - an allegation denied by medical staff. Speaking of the ""heroic"" health workers, Dr. Harris said that they are ""doing whatever they can to keep going"" while the facility has been without power since 11 November and there was not enough food and clean water. Some 700 patients were still present at the site and more than 400 health staff, in addition to around 3,000 displaced persons who had sought refuge there. Dr. Harris said that 20 patient deaths have been reported in the last 48 hours. As many as six premature babies had reportedly died at Al-Shifa over the past three days as their incubators were unable to function owing to the lack of electricity. Evacuation 'very difficult' Asked about the possibility of evacuating patients, Dr. Harris explained that all of those remaining at Al-Shifa required critical support to stay alive. Moving them ""would be a very difficult thing to ask in the best circumstances"", Dr. Harris said, let alone amid bombing, armed clashes and a lack of fuel for ambulances. ""The best way would be to stop the hostilities right now and focus on saving lives, not taking lives,"" she insisted. Record number of attacks on healthcare Some 135 attacks on health facilities have been documented in Gaza over the course of the past month, and WHO's Dr. Harris said that this was the highest number recorded in such a short amount of time. ""I hope this is the worst we ever see,"" she said. The WHO spokesperson pointed to an ""increasing trend"" of attacks on health care, also seen in other ongoing conflicts in Sudan and in Ukraine. ""It seems that somehow the understanding that a hospital must a safe haven, a place where people come to be treated when they are in need, has been forgotten,"" she told journalists.","['turkmenistan', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'switzerland', 'switzerland', 'switzerland', 'israel', 'sudan', 'ukraine']",us,False,False

Excavators have been removing debris since Sunday morning from the site of the collapse in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand to create an escape tunnel for the workers, some of whom have fallen sick. But rescue efforts have been slowed by debris continuing to fall as workers laboured to clear the tunnel, with progress stalled after an earth-boring drill developed problems. The air force flew in a second drilling machine on a C-130 Hercules military plane on Wednesday, with the giant drill bit stretching much the length of the aircraft's cargo hold. ""Drilling is starting soon,"" rescue leader Deepak Patil said Thursday. Engineers are trying to drive a steel pipe about 90 centimetres (nearly three feet) wide through the debris, wide enough for the trapped men to squeeze through. India has sought advice from the Thai company that rescued children from a flooded cave in 2018 as it races to save the men, as well as from engineering experts in soil and rock mechanics at the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute. Rescuers can communicate with the trapped men using radios. Food, water and oxygen have also been sent to the trapped workers via a pipe -- too narrow for people to escape through -- as well as medicine. No details have been given about the condition of the men or how many of them were sick. Dozens of colleagues of the trapped workers protested outside the tunnel on Wednesday, blaming authorities for ""slow rescue work"", one of the protesters told AFP. The 4.5-kilometre (2.7-mile) tunnel was being constructed between the towns of Silkyara and Dandalgaon to connect Uttarkashi and Yamunotri, two of the holiest Hindu shrines. The tunnel is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's road project aimed at improving travel conditions between some of the most popular Hindu shrines in the country as well as in areas bordering China. Experts have warned about the impact of extensive construction in Uttarakhand, where large parts of the state are prone to landslides. Accidents on big infrastructure projects are common in India. In January, at least 200 people were killed in flash floods in ecologically fragile Uttarakhand in a disaster that experts partly blamed on excessive development.","['india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'china']",us,False,False

Her comments came amid reports on Wednesday morning of an ongoing Israeli Defense Forces raid inside Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital, where patients including premature babies have died over the course of the past days after incubators and other life-saving equipment lost power. ""Hospitals are not battlegrounds,"" UN relief chief Martin Griffiths wrote on social platform X, insisting that ""the protection of newborns, patients, medical staff and all civilians must override all other concerns"". 'Grave violations' Ms. Russell condemned the ""grave violations"" against children committed by the parties to the conflict and said that she was in Gaza ""to do whatever I can to advocate for the protection of children"". ""Inside the Strip, there is nowhere safe for Gaza's one million children to turn,"" she said, highlighting that more than 4,600 children have reportedly been killed and nearly 9,000 injured. Many children are believed buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings, ""the tragic result of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas"", she said. Ceasefire now The UNICEF chief described hearing harrowing stories from her agency's staff on the ground and stressed the high risk to humanitarian actors operating inside Gaza. Since 7 October 102 staff members of the UN agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) have been killed in the enclave. Ms. Russell reiterated calls for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", the release of all abducted and detained children, and for ""safe, sustained and unimpeded access"" for humanitarians to people in need. 'Horrific situation' Mr. Griffiths, the UN's top aid official, told UN News that from a humanitarian perspective and outside of any military considerations, ""our problem is protecting the people of Gaza"". He stressed that Gazans are in a ""horrific situation in which they have no escape and are being asked to move in conditions of danger"". Over 1.5 million people in Gaza are estimated to be internally displaced, including about 787,000 who are staying in some 154 UNRWA shelters, where massive overcrowding is leading to the spread of disease. The UN humanitarian affairs coordination office OCHA headed by Mr. Griffiths reported on Wednesday that displaced people staying in makeshift tents outside the shelters in southern Gaza for lack of room are now suffering from the onset of heavy rains and flooding. Aid trucks at a standstill Regarding the lack of fuel, which has not been allowed into the Strip since the start of the crisis, Mr. Griffiths said that ""we need at least a couple hundred thousand litres to get us moving again"". UNRWA said on Tuesday night that its trucks inside Gaza were not able to pick up aid coming in through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt that day because they don't have fuel. According to media reports late on Tuesday night, Israel gave approval for 24,000 litres of diesel fuel to be used solely by trucks for UN operations but it was not clear when and how the fuel would be delivered. 'Ready to go' Mr. Griffiths explained that a ceasefire was also necessary to let the private sector operate and allow depleted shops to restock. ""That's just as important as our operations, if not more,"" he said. ""We are right there, sitting in front of those people, at the borders of Gaza, in Rafah, ready to go"" and to ""try to reach people where they are"", he insisted in his plea for access.

These impacts are unequal, disproportionately affecting the most frontline populations in the United States.""Climate change will manifest through profound changes to the movement, amounts, and timing of water,"" said CU Boulder's Liz Payton, a water resources specialist in the CIRES-based Western Water Assessment, and lead author of the water chapter. ""The water chapter offers a big-picture understanding of the magnitude of these changes and the challenges ahead.""Payton worked closely with a team of 11 authors from around the country who brought expertise inclimate science, hydrology, groundwater,water management, water quality, and Tribal water issues.The NCA is a Congressionally mandated report released every four years by the U.S. Global Change Research Program. It synthesizes scientific knowledge about current and projected trends inglobal change, both human-induced and natural, for the recent past and the next 25 to 100 years.The water chapter, one of 32 chapters in the NCA5, explores the nexus of climate change and water, such as how increasingly heavy rainfall events threaten people and infrastructure in U.S. cities andrural communities.Overall,climate change impactson water are dire; but the authors explained that science advances are increasingly helping to shape decisions. For example, the report cites international collaboration among two Canadian provinces, eight U.S. states, and several sovereign Tribes and First Nations to manage the water in the Great Lakes collaboratively and equitably, addressing both flooding and coastal wetland health.By contrast, there has been little to no progress in many areas, the chapter notes, for example, in managing the country's agingwater infrastructure. ""More than 1,000 community water systems—primarily servingolder adultsand people who are economically disadvantaged, rural, Indigenous, or with less education—are already providing poor-quality water and are not prepared to cope with climate change-driven flooding, drought, and waterborne diseases,"" the authors wrote.""Water is critical to all communities,"" said Heather Tanana, co-author and Visiting Professor at the University of California, Irvine. ""Although climate impacts to water vary across the United States, the NCA5 provides important information on how water cycle changes disproportionately affect certain communities, including Tribes. The report is a valuable tool to understand and address these inequities.""Imtiaz Rangwala, a co-author on the water chapter added that the report details many other examples of how climate change is and will impact bothwater qualityand water availability in challenging ways.""Stories of climate change are largely stories of water, whether we are talking about droughts, desertification, wildfire, or floods,"" said Rangwala, the lead climate scientist at the North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center (NC CASC).In the NCA5 Overview, the US Global Change Research Program highlighted reasons for hope: ""U.S. emissions have decreased, while the economy and population have grown,"" the report states. And ""Efforts to adapt to climate change and reduce net greenhouse gas emissions are underway in every U.S. region and have expanded since 2018.""Today, the NCA5 is in the hands of Congress and decision-makers so they can understand the current implications of climate change, including impacts on water, and what the country can expect in the future. Payton and the lead authors of other chapters are in Washington D.C. for the unveiling of the report, and they will spend the next few weeks and months discussing findings with various stakeholders and the general public in online webinars and regional workshops.""There are few, if any, benign consequences fromclimate change, and the impacts will be felt largely through changes in water,"" said Payton. ""But there is momentum in the water resources community to prepare and adapt for the changes we're seeing now and expect to experience in the future.""","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'nc']",gb,False,False

Heavy rainfall and flash flooding are having ""devastating"" consequences for 3.8 million people already displaced within Somalia. The rain comes in the wake of intersecting crises; three decades of conflict coupled with the worst drought in 40 years has led tounprecedented levelsof mass displacement and overcrowding in informal camps. ""Many areas have been left completely cut off, with bridges and roads destroyed,"" said Abdulkadir Ibrahim, director of communications at the Somali Red Crescent Society (SRCS). He told ABC News that the situation in the country's central city of Beledweyne is critical. ""90% of the population and the outlying villages have been displaced, whilst the remaining 10% are under siege. The latrine and shallow wells have been destroyed."" Videos filmed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) show residents in Beledweyne wading through waist-deep water and clinging to bridges to escape floodwater that Ibrahim (SRCS) confirms is contaminated. The intensity and volume of rainfall this Deyr rainy season, which usually runs from October to December, has been exacerbated by two weather phenomena occurring simultaneously: El Niño and the Indian Ocean Dipole, both linked to sea surface temperatures, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said. ""It would be very, very difficult, even in normal circumstances, to deal with the impacts of these floods"", said Nazanine Moshiri, senior climate and security analyst at conflict resolution thinktank Crisis Group, speaking to ABC News from Nairobi. ""Somalia's just come out of two and a half years of drought, you have deforestation and an al-Shabab militant insurgency, which is affecting and hampering humanitarian aid and pushing displacement,"" Moshiri said. ""All of this has hampered any kind of resilience building in Somalia."" Baidoa, a large southwestern city, has seen an influx of some 6,000 people since the beginning of October. Many have arrived after fleeing drought, conflict or flooding. The city now has one of Somalia's largest displaced populations, estimated at about 650,000 by the IOM. Many people moving to Baidoa have lost animals or farmland and fled to the city in the hope of accessing NGO and government support, Aliow Mohamed, Islamic Relief's country director in Somalia, told ABC News from Mogadishu. ""People are just left with nothing,"" Mohamed said. About 250,00 people living in Baidoa's informal settlements had been impacted by the flash floods as of Nov. 6, IOM said. Mohamed said the makeshift camps have been destroyed. ""It's a flat city, there is no higher ground for people to move to, there is no way for the water to be drained, it's only a matter of time before we start seeing cases of malaria and waterborne diseases,"" Mohamed said. According to the University of Notre Dame's Country Ranking on vulnerability, Somalia is the second most vulnerable country in the world to climate change. Moshiri told ABC News that more research is needed before the ""hugely complex links"" between the recent flooding and human-induced climate change are confirmed. ""What we can say for sure, is that climate change made drought in Somalia more likely, and because of the drought, the impacts of the flooding are much more pronounced,"" she said. A World Weather Attribution report found human-induced climate change made the drought in the Horn of Africa stronger and '100 times more likely'. Moshiri predicts Somalia's drought-flood cycles will become more extreme if nothing is done to reduce global emissions. ""It'll be very difficult to live in a country where 80% of people survive on rain fed agriculture,"" Moshiri said. Somalia's Disaster Management Agency (SoDMA) scaled up preparedness efforts in anticipation of the El Nino rains. A new early warning system plays a recorded flood warning message from SoDMA when any telephone number is dialed regardless of whether the call is made in an area controlled by al-Shabab or without internet. Despite early warning efforts, the U.N. predicts 3.7 million acres of farmland could be destroyed this rainy season. Samer Jarjouhi, who oversees ICRC's programs in Somalia, told ABC News that floods impact will be hard felt as it coincides with planting season. ""The farmers I have spoken to are apprehensive that their crops may be swept away. If this plays out, it will only deepen the country's already dire food insecurity problem,"" Jarjouhi said. Abdullahi Hassan, a farmer from Beledweyne, a flood-prone town in the central Hirshabelle region of Somalia, told ICRC: ""Your livelihood is swept away, and you must start from scratch"". ""You come back to bare soil. My whole family is dependent on this farm,"" he said.","['unitedkingdom', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'ecuador', 'kenya', 'mexico']",us,False,False

It's time to look beyond the status quo and considernature-based solutionsto protect the places we love.How we got hereIn many parts of the world, humans have long felt astrong connection to the coast. Wewrite stories, sing songs and build liveson the lands that touch the sea. We also build walls and other concrete, stone and metal structures toprotect those landsfrom the very seas we revere.From time immemorial, Indigenous Peoples made their homes along the coasts, becomingexperts in their knowledgeof coastal ecosystems and, on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, usedsalt marshes for food and transportation. Following European settlement, those salt marshes were drained,dykeswere built from earth and wood, and the land was cultivated for agriculture.Over time, other hard armor structuressuch asrevetmentsandbreakwaterswere constructed to block wave energy and provide additional protection for agriculture, transportation and growing cities.Where we are nowToday, Canada's coastal infrastructure includes extensive networks of seawalls, dykes, revetments and breakwaters, most of which are made ofhard materials. Hard coastal infrastructure is everywhere if you know where to look. TheCanso Causewayconnecting Cape Breton Island to mainland Nova Scotia and theVancouver seawallare just two examples.In some cases, usinghard infrastructureis unavoidable. Indeed,hard infrastructureis critical for maintaining transportation and energy infrastructure, including roads, railroads and ports.However, hard infrastructure almost alwaysincreases erosionin adjacent areas, is expensive to maintain and degrades over time. Engineers predict that repairs, includingraising the dykes along the Chignecto Isthmusbetween New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, will cost between $189 and $300 million.With such an astronomical price tag, even smaller projects are simply not an option for many municipalities or individual landowners.In the face of such challenges, there are opportunities to adapt engineering and protective infrastructure to be more sustainable by integratingnatural elementsand processes.Nature-based solutionsNature-based approachespreserve or reintroduce natural structures and materials into the environment, recognizing and respectingnatural systemsand their benefits for humans.Nature-based approaches range from those that are entirely natural to hybrid solutions, which incorporate traditional hard engineering with natural features.Examples of nature-based solutionsincludedyke realignment to restore natural water flow and allow saltmarsh reestablishment, wetland and dune restoration, and living shorelines which utilize plants, sand and rock to protect the coast.Nature-based approaches can involvereserving land for natural systems by protecting them from developmentand making room for the evolution of natural systems; they can alsoinvolve moving back from the coast, and releasing land back to nature.Hard infrastructure weakens over time while nature-based solutions grow stronger as plants establish roots, biodiversity increases and natural processes adjust.Nature-based solutions provide a wide array of benefits. In addition to protecting coastal places from flooding, storm surges and erosion. Nature-based solutionsprevent shoreline pollution,support biodiversity, canincrease property valueand contribute to overallhuman well-being.Incorporating nature-based solutions requires innovation and open-mindedness that may feel intimidating and it is ofteneasier to trust a stone or concrete wallover the energy absorbing power of plants and soil.As such,raising awarenessabout different nature-based options and being transparent aboutcosts and benefitscan help build confidence in nature-based solutions.Successful nature-based solutions also require place-basedcollaboration and knowledge sharingbetween impacted peoples, engineers, scientists and decision-makers that consider social and ecological interests.Nature-based solutions cannot be prescribed as top-down interventions. Every situation is unique, and many people with diverse knowledge and perspectives should come together to decide how specific nature-based approaches can meet various infrastructure, ecological and social needs as well as increase flood resilience.What now?Fornatural resourceand permitting agencies, as well as many property owners, the tradition of building hard armored shorelines remains deeply ingrained. Current guidance documents, policies and habits were built for hard infrastructure. In some cases,bureaucratic decision-making structuresmove slower than hazards from flooding.In other cases, including lack of or delayed implementation of legislation, such asthe Coastal Protection Actand regulations in Nova Scotia,political interestshinder planning actions that would limit hard infrastructure and development along the coast.An overview of the problems of erosion facing many communities across Canada, particularly in the North. Credit: CBCMany Canadiansare buying homes in areas with high flood risk. The infrastructure they rely upon isagingand requires adaptation. Infrastructure supportingbridges, roadsandrail linesneeds to be upgraded or removed, providing opportunities to incorporate nature-based solutions.Hope for the futureAs we look towards what can feel like an ominous future, there are many resources for individuals or organizations seeking additional information and guidance about nature-based solutions.TransCoastal Adaptations: Center for Nature-based Solutionsis a practitioner, academic and government partnership in Nova Scotia focused on restoration, managed realignment and climate change adaptation.Privately owned companies, also in Nova Scotia,Helping Heal NatureandCB Wetlands and Environmental Specialists, focus on ecological restoration, living shorelines and community stewardship and education. Nation-widecommunities of practiceexist to build capacity for natural and nature-based approaches.As more people learn about nature-based solutions, there will be more opportunities to incorporate natural process into coastal protection. We know the stakes, and we have nature-based solutions at hand. It's time to give dirt and plants a chance.","['canada', 'canada', 'bangladesh']",gb,False,False

Low water in the shipping channel sometimes strands traffic in sections of the river, while high water levels have forced operators to close locks and restrict shipping capacity to reflect more difficult conditions for tugs pushing massive collections of river barges.Although low water often provides more dramatic images, the researchers found that high water levels have had significantly more impact, particularly on sections of the river south of St. Louis. By measuring periods in which authorities imposed navigation restrictions each year, the researchers concluded that the upper Mississippi has lost about 24 good days' worth of shipping in an average year when comparing conditions at the beginning and end of the study period.""I was as surprised as everyone else,"" said Gabriele Villarini, the corresponding author and a professor of civil and environmental engineering and the High Meadows Environmental Institute at Princeton.Working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency responsible for navigation along the Mississippi, the researchers obtained records from river gauges at 39 locations along the river. The paper, ""Reduced and More Fragmented Mississippi River Navigability by Rising Flow,"" was published Oct. 10 inGeophysical Review Letters.The researchers correlated this data with navigation plans the Coast Guard implements for the river based on water conditions and other factors. The researchers analyzed the data to find out whether water levels varied seasonally or over other periods of time, and whether there was a long-term pattern of change that could indicate improvement or decline in river conditions.It is an important question. The Mississippi is one of the world's most important waterways, moving goods to and from the Great Lakes and Midwest through the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic via the St. Lawrence Seaway.The researchers said between 2015 and 2019 river traffic carried a yearly average of 400 million tons of goods, peaking at 500 million tons in 2017 and 2018. The Mississippi carries 92% of U.S. agricultural exports and 78% of world exports in feed grain and soybeans. River traffic is extremely efficient—an average 15-barge tow has the same capacity as 1,050 large semi-truck trailers, the researchers said.To support the traffic, the United States maintains a 9-foot-deep shipping channel from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Minneapolis. Oceangoing vessels access a 45-foot-deep channel for ports between New Orleans and Baton Rouge.The system also includes 28 locks and dams along the main stem of the Upper Mississippi and seven locks along the Illinois River waterway. The Mississippi system also features major rail and highway connections as transit hubs at sites including St. Louis, New Orleans and Chicago.Villarini said the researchers had noticed recent issues with water conditions on the river in the past few years. In 2022, the Mississippi experienced a significant drought that resulted in news coverage of barges stranded by low water at points in the river. At the same time, high water periods posed their own problems. The Bonnet Carré Spillway upstream of New Orleans, used during high water, was operated eight times between 1931 and 2007; it was operated seven times between 2008 and 2020.Villarini, then a professor at the University of Iowa, thought the time was right to examine conditions along the Mississippi after a season of low water stranded barges along stretches of the river.A new graduate student, Renato Amorim, had just joined Villarini's research team. Before attendinggraduate school, Amorim worked for the Brazilian government as a specialist in river navigation.Amorim said that one of the challenges in evaluating conditions along the Mississippi is the regional nature of the river. Not only do conditions vary among different sections, but each section has its own navigational challenges. The Upper Mississippi, with its many locks and bridges, is more often affected by high water levels, while the broad reaches of the Lower Mississippi are often more impacted by low water levels.Spending time on the river with pilots and tugboat captains, Amorim learned that despite worsening conditions on the river, cargo volumes on the Mississippi have increased in recent decades. He attributed this to the efficiency of the captains and crews, who have adapted to conditions.This successful adaptation might have cloaked the long-term changes in conditions. Villarini, a hydrologist whose research often focuses on flooding and the impacts of a changing climate, said the researchers took a broad view of the river system to look at long-term changes. Villarini said the researchers were careful not to speculate on the causes of the decline. He said those conclusions will require a more detailed and complex analysis of the region's hydrology.He said that without understanding the causes, it will be difficult to propose solutions.""What does it mean for the next 30 years?"" Villarini said. ""If we don't understand the causes, it is very risky to extrapolate trends to the future.""","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'us']",gb,False,False

Hazel Nairn, 71, was last seen at the River Don, near Monymusk, last November while out with her dog. Relatives think her body could still be caught somewhere along the river. A specialist underwater team initially searched in October and will return. Hazel's daughter Anneka described it as ""a very sad weekend for us all"". She told BBC Scotland News: ""We never thought when this awful tragedy happened one year ago that we would be in a position where we are still desperately looking for my mum. ""I don't want people to think of us or our heartache but to think of my mum Hazel and how she is not home yet or at peace but out there, somewhere, all alone. ""We will never ever know what really happened but would ask the public to keep an eye out for any of her belongings as so much is still missing and in this whole year not one further item has been recovered. ""We will be paying the river a visit."" The river continues for 31 miles from Hazel's last known location until it meets the sea. The search has focused on areas such as bends where a body might be more likely to be trapped. The body of Hazel's dog was found in the days after she went missing. Beneath the Surface is a voluntary underwater search and recovery dive team based in Lancashire. Team leader Phil Jones said bad weather and flooding had hampered the expected renewed effort in recent weeks. Experts will this weekend continue searching a previously identified seven-mile stretch of the river, starting from the entry point. Mr Jones said: ""We will focus on that main section before moving further down river. ""River conditions are always very challenging. It's now a year since Hazel disappeared, so that is a very long time, with a lot of different things that can happen. ""It's going to take us a great deal of time to search. The only real way to do it adequately is by visual inspection by divers being in the water which is quite slow and has to be done methodically and it is quite time consuming. ""We can never give guarantees at all in any missing persons case, especially where water is concerned."" He added: ""It's obviously been a tough year for the family, a very difficult year. ""This weekend especially will be very emotional for them. ""We don't take any payment, we do it on our own time and expense. ""Our main goal is to help families get answers and closure.""","['unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom']",gb,True,True

Perth and Kinross Council chief executive Thomas Glen also said lessons had to be learned from its response. He was speaking following publication of an initial report into the impact of the severe conditions, which will be considered by councillors next week. Residents in North Inch previously condemned the hold up after homes and businesses were flooded. The Bell's Sports Centre as well as basement flats and businesses on Rose Terrace and Charlotte Street were among those affected by the torrential downpours. Members of the council's scrutiny and performance committee will next week examine an initial report into the impact of the heavy rainfall. It features feedback from residents, including from a recent meeting held with people living along the River Tay in Perth. Council chief executive Thomas Glen said on Friday that his thoughts were with all those residents who had experienced flooding. He added: ""From feedback, we heard lots of positive examples from residents who have told us that the approach in their area worked. ""However, we also know that there were instances where we have not met the standards of support that residents, and we expect, during the response and recovery phase. ""I apologise where that has been the experience and commit to improvement though the review process."" Mr Glen acknowledged the timing of closing flood gates at the North Inch had ""understandably been a source of significant public conversation"". He said: ""The review does not shy away from dealing with that. Investigations into the range of contributory factors are still ongoing. We continue to review the data and are undertaking ongoing work to assess all impacts."" As a result of the report a full review of the Perth Flood Scheme Gate Closure Operational Procedure will be carried out in partnership with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa). Although the report focuses on the weekend of 6-8 October, it also considers what happened during Storm Babet and in the build-up to more recent weather warnings. Perthshire North MSP John Swinney previously called on the council to address the concerns of residents and ""provide a full explanation of the situation"". Mid Scotland and Fife MSP Murdo Fraser criticised the local authority's ""poor handling"" of the flood management system. Do you have an idea for a story we could cover?

The couple showed ABC News' meteorologist Rob Marciano the spot where their home used to be, now an empty lot covered in sea lavender and some shards of their former life. ""If we would have got paid by insurance the right amount of money, it would have been a you would have been standing in a new house,"" Harry Appel said. ""Insurance was tough — that was worse than a storm."" In September 2017, Hurricane Irma barrelled across the Atlantic with winds reaching 185 miles per hour — the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, according to theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Category 4 storm ravaged the Appel's dream home, along with much of the region, leaving those hit hardest by the storm to contend with an insurance market already struggling to cover its claims. Since moving into their home in Big Pine Key in 2015, the Appels paid into premium homeowner insurance policies — theNational Flood Insurance Programprovided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""A week afterward, the guy came up from Texas — the underwriter for flood insurance for FEMA — and he came up and he looked at the house and for him to write a check on the spot for this entire policy, which was amazing. And at that point, I really felt better,"" Harry Appel said. Harry Appel told ABC News that FEMA paid out the $110,000 flood policy, but when the private insurance company responsible for the Appels' wind coverage came to assess the damage, they claimed the damage had only been done by flooding, so the company wasn't liable. ""We were entitled to this money,"" Jen Appel said. ""This was a contractual obligation that they did not live up to and it should have been paid."" Home insurance isn't mandatory by law, but banks often require homeowners to get insurance as a condition of a mortgage. ""The insurer's goal is to collect more in premiums than they pay out in claims,"" said Ben Keys, University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business professor of real estate and finance. ""We're seeing higher costs of materials, higher costs of labor, and those are growing faster than inflation."" In recent decades, the intensity of some hurricanes has exploded, fueled by the warming seas, according to experts. ""We're having more disasters, we're having more costly disasters, and importantly, more people live in harm's way,"" Keys said. ""So any individual disaster now leads to more payouts coming from the insurers — and they're recognizing that these costs are rising quickly, not just because of inflation, and they're reacting accordingly."" 2023 marked the most ""billion dollar disasters"" on record for the United States, with25 climate-related disasters, according to NOAA. As these events have gotten more costly, some of the largest private insurance companies, like Farmers, have left states like Florida entirely. Still, other companies have gone insolvent due to the increasing cost of claims, leaving a market with fewer options for residents to choose from. Three-fourths of Florida's 21.5 million residents live in coastal counties, according to theInsurance Information Institute, and it was Hurricane Andrew in 1992 that first exposed the vulnerabilities of the private insurance market in the state. In the aftermath of Andrew, Florida created a last-resort state-run program calledCitizens Property Insurance Corporationwith the mission of insuring homeowners who can't otherwise find coverage. ""We've seen a number of large insurers go belly up, and in response, we've seen a lot of homeowners who are now dependent on the state's public insurance plan. So Citizens Property Insurance is now the largest homeowner's insurer in the state,"" Keys said. ""And what that points to is a private insurance market that's simply not working."" Florida is just one of 32 states and the District of Columbia that offers a state-run FAIR (Fair Access to Insurance Requirements) plan. Another of the 32, Louisiana, is struggling with some of the same issues. Keys explained that sea level rise and more severe flooding after storms, ""have continued to drive up costs for homeowners in that state."" Tammy and Charles Guillory and their daughter Caylee lived inside the cramped quarters of an RV parked in their driveway for two years during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic after their home was hit byHurricanes Lauraand Delta in 2020. ""Some days I didn't know how we was gonna make it, but we made it,"" Tammy Guillory said. ""It was hard."" After the one-two punch of the hurricanes, just six weeks apart, the Guillorys turned to their insurance companies to pay out their policies. ""We did what we were supposed to do on our end of the bargain,"" Tammy Guillory said. ""Now it's time for them to do what they are supposed to do."" To have their policy paid, the Guillorys had to take their unmet claim to the courts. They won their case, but the insurer appealed, so the family had to wait even longer. ""I was a client of this company for over 20 years with no missed payments — nothing,"" Charles Guillory said. ""But when it's time for us to be able to receive, we have to go through this, and I don't think it's right."" Attorney Michael Cox represented the Guillorys, along with hundreds of similar cases in the area. ""When you have this massive catastrophe, I think the insurance companies came in and they know statistically that most people will just walk away with the mistreatment — and they did,"" Cox said. ""Most people won't fight like Charles and Tammy fought. They stood up for themselves and they were willing to go all the way to bat with this company."" While the Guillorys eventually won their case, the story across the state doesn't always have a happy ending. Louisiana still has the third highest insurance premiums in the country,according to III. The market has been deteriorating since the state was hit by record hurricane activity in 2020, causing upwards of $23 billion in damage. In the aftermath of the disasters, 12 insurers were declared insolvent because of their losses during that time and another 12 voluntarily withdrew from the state. Over the last two years, Louisiana's state-run insurance plan — Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corp. — more than tripled the number of policies it carries, from 35,000 to 128,000, according to theLouisiana Department of Insurance. ""The drama in Louisiana was that the state insurance regulator increased premiums by 65% earlier this year for the state-run plan,"" Keys said. ""And that was a recognition that they simply didn't have enough capital on hand to weather an even moderate storm."" The state government approved a $45 million fund in February of this year to help stabilize the market. Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon says it's a first step to court companies to come back to the state. ""That's a balance between the obligation we have to make insurance available, to attract companies and the obligation we have to make them responsive and fair with their policyholders,"" Donelon said. Reinsurance often creates another kink in the chain. ""Reinsurance is most easily thought of as insurance for insurance companies,"" Keys explained. ""So insurance companies are going to take on risky policies from homeowners all over the country, and they're going to have a portfolio of risk, and they'd like to protect themselves from the worst case scenarios."" As natural disasters become more costly around the country, the cost to stay for reinsurers is also increasing. ""They have a lot of influence in the decisions that insurers make,"" Keys said. ""They have invested heavily in climate modeling and they have some of the best data and the best models out there. And because this is the only business that they do, they have a lot of money at stake."" As insurance issues continue across the Gulf Coast, some have looked to fortifying their homes to withstand these powerful storms as a possible solution. At the University of Miami, researchers are testing how to fortify homes with their hurricane simulator, showing us that the way homes are built could be one key to reversing the insurance market retreat. ""Insurance companies, as well as reinsurance, rely heavily on numerical models,"" UMiami assistant scientist Milan Curcic said. ""How likely is it that certain areas will experience wind of this threshold, flooding of this level, and so on."" While some can afford to fortify their homes and choose to self-insure, Keys said those who can't should ""shop around"" for policies. As for the Appels, they settled for a fraction of their policy payout after two years of litigation and being forced into escrow with their bank. They now live in their bed and breakfast and have given up on rebuilding their home. ""When we don't have a mortgage here, there will be no insurance here,"" Jen Appel said. ""So I'm joining the ranks with self-insuring, really self-insuring — don't just say you're going to self-insure. You better have a bankroll."" While Harry is ready to move away, Jen says she doesn't want to go. ""The only reason we're still here is because I don't want to go,"" Jen Appel said. ""But I didn't go through all that to get to this point where I haven't enjoyed any of it.""","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'india', 'italy', 'serbia']",us,True,True

Some X employees are facing the brunt of the uproar, and are reportedly getting calls from advertisers asking about Musk's comments, according toThe New York Times. The advertisers have also been asking about a recent report from non-profitMedia Mattersthat found that ads from major companies have also been appearing next to pro-Nazi and pro-white nationalist posts on Musk's platform. The uproar began when Musk responded in agreement on Wednesday to a post that said that Jewish communities were pushing hatred against white people. X user@BreakingBahtsaid that ""western Jewish populations"" were coming to the ""disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country"" don't like them. The post was quickly criticized as echoing the ""great replacement theory,"" which is a common belief among white supremacists. The theory accuses marginalized racial and ethnic groups of coming to the US and other predominantly white countries to take over the population and eradicate white people. ""You have said the actual truth,"" Musk replied to the post. IBMhas suspended advertising on X after ads for the company were shown next to pro-Nazi content. IBM said in a previous statement to Business Insider that it has ""zero tolerance for hate speech and discrimination."" IBM also pulled back on a deal to spend $1 million in advertising on X during the end of 2023. X has also been placing advertisements next to major companies like Apple, Oracle, and Xfinity, according toMedia Matters. BI has reached out to those companies for comment. X CEO Linda Yaccarino posted a response to claims of antisemitism on X Thursday afternoon. ""X has been extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination.

The billionaire has received backlash after he agreed with a user who many said was promoting ‘Great Replacement Theory,’ – one of the staples of far-right ideology in the US. While Musk had previously been accused of tolerating anti-Semitic messages on X, the tech entrepreneur insisted that he does not espouse hatred of Jews. He did criticize Israel’s heavy-handed tactics in Gaza earlier this month, arguing that they were bound to create more terrorists in the long run. On Wednesday, Musk wrote that an X user had “said the actual truth” when he accused Jewish communities of “hatred against whites.” The post, which the billionaire agreed with, went on to suggest that Jewish people are now “coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don’t exactly like them too much.” Not long afterwards, IBM issued a statement saying it had “immediately suspended all advertising on X while we investigate this entirely unacceptable situation.” The technology giant added that it “has zero tolerance for hate speech.” The New York Times, citing internal messages, reported on Thursday that X employees had also been receiving calls from other advertisers with respect to Musk’s latest comment. Attempting to control the damage, X chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, reportedly sent out a statement to staff members, reiterating that “X is a platform for everyone” and that “discrimination by everyone should STOP across the board.” Meanwhile, the American Jewish Committee described the claim endorsed by Musk as part of the ‘Great Replacement Theory,’ according to which ethnic minorities are replacing white European populations. Facebook cofounder and Asana CEO Dustin Moskovitz called on Musk to resign from all his posts, with Tesla investor Ross Gerber writing that he had been receiving a “flood of messages from clients wanting out of Tesla and anything to do with Elon Musk. Several other tech world personalities and journalists were also quick to accuse the Tesla CEO of promoting anti-Semitism. Parrying similar allegations back in September, Musk claimed that he was in fact “aspirationally Jewish.” Last week, the billionaire did, however, call into question Israel’s strategy in Gaza. “If you kill somebody’s child in Gaza, you’ve made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill Israelis,” Musk argued on the Lex Fridman podcast.","['us', 'israel', 'israel', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories']",ru,False,False

A second heavy drill is to be airlifted into the northern state of Uttarakhand after the existing giant machine -- itself flown in as a replacement by the air force on Wednesday -- hit a boulder, officials said. Excavators have been removing debris since Sunday morning to create an escape route for the workers after a portion of the tunnel they were building collapsed in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand. Rescue efforts have been slowed by debris that has continued to fall. Engineers are trying to drive a steel pipe about 90 centimetres (nearly three feet) wide through the debris -- wide enough for the trapped men to squeeze through. ""Drilling has been done up to 24 metres (78 feet) for safe extraction,"" Anshu Manish Khalko, director of the government's highways and infrastructure corporation told reporters on Friday afternoon. But he said around 36 meters (118 feet) of pipe still needed to be laid to reach the workers. ""That may take time"", he said, without giving further details. After the first earth-boring drill developed problems, the air force on Wednesday flew in a second machine on a C-130 Hercules military plane. The giant drill bit stretched much of the length of the aircraft's cargo hold. As rescuers race to save the men, India has sought advice from the Thai company that rescued children from a flooded cave in 2018, as well as engineering experts in soil and rock mechanics at the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute. Rescuers have been communicating with the trapped men using radios. Food, water, oxygen and medicine have also been sent to the trapped workers via a six-inch-wide (15-centimetre) pipe. No official details have been given about the condition of the men, but local media reported that some were suffering from vomiting, headaches, anxiety and stomach problems. A six-bed field hospital has also been set up outside the site with ambulances on standby to transfer serious cases to a proper hospital. The tunnel is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's road project aimed at improving travel conditions between some of the most popular Hindu shrines in the country as well as in areas bordering China. Experts have warned about the impact of extensive construction in Uttarakhand, where large parts of the state are prone to landslides. Accidents on big infrastructure projects are common in India. In January, at least 200 people were killed in flash floods in ecologically fragile Uttarakhand in a disaster that experts partly blamed on excessive development.","['india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'china']",us,False,False

The World Bank said that the number of poor people in Kenya could increase by 1.1 million by 2050 if there is ""inaction against climate change"".""Furthermore, death and illness due to malaria and water borne diseases are expected to increase by 56 percent and 10 percent respectively by 2050,"" the Washington-based lender said. The country of 53 million people will need $62 billion by 2030 to adapt its economy to climate challenges, according to the government.""Financing to increase Kenya's resilience to climate change will require both domestic resources and expanding climate-compatible private investment in existing areas, such as livestock feed and tourism, and emerging sectors, such as e-mobility and green energy,"" the World Bank said.But Kenya's government has limited room for manoeuvre, with its coffers depleted as it struggles to contain skyrocketing inflation and a plunging currency that has sent debt repayment costs soaring.The country's public debt stood at more than 10.1 trillion shillings ($66 billion) at the end of June, according to Treasury figures, equivalent to around two-thirds of GDP.Kenya also has a $2-billion eurobond repayment due next year.The agriculture sector, which is the top contributor to Kenya's economy, representing around 21 percent of GDP in 2022, has already come under pressure from drought and torrential rains.","['kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'unitedstates']",in,False,False

Now rebranded as X, the site formerly known as Twitter has experienced a surge in racist, antisemitic and other hateful speech. Under Elon Musk 's watch, millions of people have been exposed to misinformation about climate change. Foreign governments and operatives -- from Russia to China to Hamas -- have spread divisive propaganda with little or no interference. Musk and his team have repeatedly asserted that such concerns are overblown, sometimes pushing back aggressively against people who voice them. Yet dozens of studies from multiple organizations have shown otherwise, demonstrating on issue after issue a similar trend: an increase in harmful content on X during Musk's tenure. The war between Israel and Hamas -- the sort of major news event that once made Twitter an essential source of information and debate -- has drowned all social media platforms in false and misleading information, but for Musk's platform in particular the war has been seen as a watershed. The conflict has captured in full how much the platform has descended into the ""free-for-all hellscape"" that he promised advertisers he wanted to avoid on the day he officially took over last year. ""With disinformation about the Israel-Hamas conflict flourishing so dramatically on X, it feels that it crossed a line for a lot of people where they can see -- beyond just the branding change -- that the old Twitter is truly gone,"" Tim Chambers of Dewey Square Group, a public affairs company that tracks social media, said in an interview. ""And the new X is a shadow of that former self."" The growing sense of chaos on the platform has already hurt Musk's investment. People visited the website 5.9 billion times in September, down 13% from the same month last year, according to data analysis firm Similarweb . Advertisers have also fled, leading to a sizable slump in sales. Musk noted this summer that ad revenue had fallen 50%. He blamed the Anti-Defamation League, one of several advocacy groups that have cataloged the rise of hateful speech on X, for ""trying to kill this platform."" Most of the problems, however, stem from changes that Musk instituted -- some intentionally, some not. Studies about the state of X have been conducted over the past year by researchers and analysts at universities, think tanks and advocacy organizations concerned with the spread of hate speech and other harmful content. He disbanded an advisory council focused on trust and safety issues and laid off scores of employees who addressed them. For a monthly fee, he offered users a blue checkmark, a label that once conveyed that Twitter had verified the identity of the user behind an account. He then used algorithms to promote accounts of uncertain provenance in users' feeds. He removed labels that identified government and state media accounts for countries like Russia and China that censor independent media. ""The entire year's worth of changes to X were fully stress-tested during the global news breaking last week,"" Chambers said, referring to the conflict in Israel. ""And in the eyes of many, myself included, it failed utterly."" X remains one of the most popular social media platforms, trailing only Facebook's 16.3 billion monthly visits and Instagram's 6.4 billion visits, according to Similarweb. TikTok , which is rising in popularity among certain demographic groups, has roughly 2 billion visits each month. Despite voluble threats by disgruntled users to move to alternative platforms - Mastodon, BlueSky or Meta's new rival to Musk's, Threads -- none of them have yet reached the critical mass to replicate the public exposure that X offers. Keeping X at the center of public debate is exactly Musk's goal, which he describes at times with a messianic zeal. The day after Hamas attacked Israel, Musk urged his followers to follow ""the war in real time."" He then cited two accounts that are notorious for spreading disinformation, including a false post in the spring that an explosion had occurred outside the Pentagon . Faced with a flurry of criticism, Musk deleted the post and later sounded chastened. ""As always, please try to stay as close to the truth as possible, even for stuff you don't like,"" he wrote. ""This platform aspires to maximize signal/noise of the human collective."" Musk, the prominent, outspoken executive behind Tesla and Space X, had been an avid Twitter user for years before taking it over, promoting his ventures and himself, at times with crude, offensive comments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he sharply criticized lockdowns and other measures to slow its spread and began to warn of a ""woke"" culture that silenced dissent. Among his first acts as owner was to reverse the bans on thousands of accounts, including those of users who had spread disinformation about COVID and the 2020 election campaign. Others included followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory and fringe characters known for racist, sexist and homophobic demagogy. The impact was instantaneous. Researchers at Tufts, Rutgers and Montclair State University documented spikes in the use of racial and ethnic slurs within hours of Musk's acquisition. A coordinated campaign on 4chan, a notorious bulletin board, encouraged the use of a particular slur in what seemed to be a test of the new owner's tolerance for offensive speech. The prevalence of such offensive language has, according to numerous studies, continued unabated. ""The Musk acquisition saw a sustained rise in hateful speech on the platform,"" a peer-reviewed article in the Misinformation Review, a journal of the Harvard Kennedy School, wrote in August. Worse, the article suggested, Musk's changes appear to be boosting the engagements of the most contentious users. A month into Musk's ownership, the platform stopped enforcing its policy against COVID-19 misinformation. Liberal watchdog group Media Matters later identified the 250 accounts with the most engagement on COVID-related tweets. Nine of the top 10 accounts were known anti-vaccine proponents, several of whom promoted unproven and potentially harmful treatments and attacked top public health officials. Musk's first summer as X's boss also coincided with a rash of climate-related disasters around the world, including deadly heat waves, rampaging wildfires, torrential rains and intense flooding. Last month, a score card evaluating social media companies on their defenses against climate-related falsehoods awarded X a single point out of a possible 21 (Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, was given 8 points). The platform was ""lacking clear policies that address climate misinformation, having no substantive public transparency mechanisms, and offering no evidence of effective policy enforcement,"" according to the accompanying report from Climate Action Against Disinformation, an international coalition of more than 50 environmental advocacy groups. Earlier this year, X said it would end free access to software that allowed researchers to collect and analyze data about the site. In a public letter, hundreds of researchers, journalists and civil society groups said that the new hurdles to data access would disrupt an array of public-interest projects and ""reduce the very transparency that both the platform and our societies desperately need."" Perhaps the most impactful change under Musk has been the evolution of his subscription plans. The blue checkmark that previously denoted verified accounts, often those of government agencies, companies and prominent users, could now be purchased for $8 a month -- by anyone. The label that once conveyed veracity is now up for grabs. Reset, a nonprofit research organization, discovered that dozens of anonymous accounts linked to the Kremlin received the moniker, pushing Russian narratives on the war in Ukraine. In April, Musk then removed the blue badges from the verified users. New accounts impersonating public officials, government agencies and celebrities proliferated, causing confusion about which were real. The platform went on to reward those who paid by amplifying their posts over those without the badge. The same month, the platform also removed the labels that identified official state media of countries like Russia, China and Iran. In the 90 days following the change, engagement with posts from the English-language accounts of those outlets soared 70%, NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, reported in September. Musk has now run afoul of the European Union's newly enacted Digital Services Act, a law that requires social media platforms to restrict misinformation and other violative content within the union's 27 nations. A report commissioned by the union's executive body warned in August that Musk's dismantling of guardrails on the platform had resulted in a 36% increase in engagement with Kremlin-linked accounts between January and May, mostly pushing Russia's justifications for its illegal invasion of Ukraine last year. After the war in Israel erupted, Thierry Breton, a European Commission member who oversees putting the law into effect, issued a warning to Musk in a letter -- posted on X -- that the company needed to address ""violent and terrorist content that appears to circulate on your platform."" Reset, the research organization, reported Friday that it had documented 166 posts that its researchers considered antisemitic, including many that would appear to violate laws in several European countries, including calls for violence against Jews and denying the historical facts of the Holocaust. They accumulated at least 23 million views and 480,000 engagements. Musk, who has remade the platform in his own image, sounded incredulous, even as the company scrambled to delete accounts linked to Hamas and other terrorist groups. Even so, he responded two days later to an account, @KanekoaTheGreat, that according to the Anti-Defamation League is one of the most prominent purveyors of disinformation. The account had once been removed from Twitter but was restored in December 2022 after Musk took over. ""They still haven't provided any examples of disinformation,"" Musk replied.

Lead investors includeFind Satoshi Lab(developer of STEPN),Folius Ventures,Meteorite Labs,Incuba Alpha,KSK Fund(by Keisuke Honda, ex-soccer captain of Japan), and a stellar lineup of Web3 founders, Web2 entrepreneurs, hedge fund managers, traders, etc. “OMTrade represents a new frontier in crypto trading,”commented Mable Jiang, Chief Revenue Officer at Find Satoshi Lab,“OMTrade strives to cultivate an organic community where everyone can learn and invest together, making financial freedom accessible to a wider audience. We share that vision and are excited to take part in this journey.” At its core, OMTrade revolutionizes social trading byrealigning the interestsof traders and followers viainnovative product featureslike same-batch transactions, monthly high watermark settlement, and market-oriented profit sharing structure. Equally importantly, OMTrade introduces the role ofpromotersto onboard the best trading talents and the next billion crypto investors. This feat will unleash ofpower of influencers, allowing them to contribute fairly and sustainably to the growth of the OMTrade community. Michael Lee, the founder of OMTrade, further explains: “Our mission at OMTrade is to break down the barriers in the crypto trading world. We are empowering everyday investors with the tools and insights to trade confidently, just like the pros, but without needing years of experience.” With its innovative approach to copy trading, backed by some of the biggest names in the crypto industry, OMTrade is ready to embark on its mission: empower the young generation with easier access to the financial markets and a fair chance to win big with its many possibilities. As Michael puts it: “OMTrade is not just about creating a platform; we're building a community where anyone can invest like the best.” Crypto Trading? Copy Trading! “While crypto is revolutionizing how the young generation strives for a better life, trading crypto remains challenging at best,” Michael added. In a 7x24, extremely fast-moving market, retail traders are faced with huge knowledge barriers, information siloes, unreasonable trading rules, and the general lack of professional investment vehicles to rely on. Copy tradinghas gained traction as one of the favorite strategies for retail users in crypto, and for good reasons. Copy trading leverages the expertise of seasoned traders, degen or disciplined alike, to offer retail traders more ease and confidence. It also allows for diversification that spreads risks to generate potentially more stable returns over time. Lastly, copy trading provides a hand-off approach for those with limited time or experience to follow the market closely. “More importantly, we at OMTrade believe copy trading is the best answer to the next billion Web3 users’ investment demand,” Michael stressed. Although leading technologies like account abstraction and intent-driven protocols pave the way for web2 adoptions, newcomers’learning curvesare most unlikely to remain steep. Copy trading willeffectively lower the entry barriers of investing in cryptofor new crypto users and those wishing to gain exposure to the rapid development of Web3. In this way, they will benefit from crypto’s next bull cycle without the need for constant, difficult decision-making. As a pioneer in social and copy trading, OMTrade seeks to transform how the young generation invests in crypto through user education and social interactions. Trade like a Pro, Truly this time Current copy trading platforms are mostly embedded within large exchanges. However, several limitations made it less well-received than promised. Many of the current copy trading platforms have resulted in amisalignment of interestsbetween traders and followers. For example, there is high price slippage for followers’ trades. Most of the platforms only allow followers to settle positions daily, while offering limited diversity among trader profiles or strategies. These altogether have discouraged more pro-traders and users from onboarding. OM trading platform has been established to make crypto copy trading morefair, sustainable, and creative, based on deep industry know-how: - With OMTrade, followers’ trades will besettled together in a single batchwith the traders’ transactions that they have committed to copy. Followers’ trades will receive the same price as the traders’, eliminating malicious front-running prevalent in many current copy trading platforms. - This is a significant step torealign the interestsof traders and followers, especially for some relatively illiquid, new crypto assets. - In addition to daily settlement schedules, OMTrade will introduce multiple settlement schedules to traders and followers ofdifferent risk appetites, primarily throughmonthly high watermarks. - Longer settlement options not only encourage longer-term focused traders to thrive on OMTrade, but also ensure that followers can enjoy the many benefits of longer investment horizons. - Last but not least, OMTradersenjoy high degrees of freedomregarding incentive structure and data privacy. They will be able to adjust their profit-sharing ratio according to varying market or competitive conditions. They may also customize data disclosures on OMTrade beyond some minimum requirements. - For example, senior professional traders may choose to show very limited social and take a larger-than-average cut from copy traders, as long as there are enough followers signing up willingly and knowingly. - In future, followers will be able to find their tailor-made strategies via intelligent recommendations based on their web2 and web3 data. In all, OM is expanding to reach both users and traders who were mostly neglected and driven out of the existing crypto copy trading platforms due to conflicts of interest. Realigning these various interests while allowing for more user autonomy, OMTrade is essentially forging a mutually inspiring platform.” This is a place where everyone has the capacity to trade and invest transparently and effortlessly, just like a pro,” Michael stressed. For a smoother start, OMTradealready onboarded many top-tier traders. For instance, OMTrade just onboarded an all-star trader who generated400% cumulative return over 2 yearson Japan’s largest copy trading exchange. Some top master traders on Binance and Bybit also followed suit. Institutional crypto funds and trading communities, such as Avalanche Alpha, Defi Long, and Helios Tech all initiated a partnership with OMTrade and will be deploying their products there soon. Find your own master trader at OMTrade’scopy trading hub. Better Call Promoters! “However, during our field research, where we interviewed hundreds of crypto traders, we realized that many professional traders findcurrent copy trading platforms frivolous,” continued Michael. “If they focus only on trading itself, they are likely to fail to find a decent number of followers with significant investment positions; but if they just focus on branding and marketing themselves, it just defeats the purpose.” This is why OMTrade has decided to introduce a new role -Promoters, in between the current trader-follower duality. Essentially, promoters are thescouts for star traders. They discover the pro-traders worth following, spread the word to their communities, and earn a cut on the commission fees and, more importantly, the followers’ trading profits. While traditional Web3 influencers often call on specific investment ideas on debatable grounds, promoters on OMTrade are actually helping people find highly reliable investment vehicles:genuine professional tradersbacked by real track records under a fair, sustainable framework. With thepower of promoters, pro-traders on OM will be able to leverage funds pooled together from followers brought by influencers who focusonlyon getting popularity for them. Thus, traders can concentrate on maximizing earnings for the group without being distracted. Now with atrinity of traders, promoters, and followers, OMTrade is ready to revolutionize how copy trading is executed in Web3, enabling everyone to have a chance to share earnings from crypto, freely and fairly. OM Together, Win Big OMTrade believes that theessence of copy trading is community. ""OM"" in Sanskrit represents the cosmic vibration that unites everything in the universe. It signifies oneness and interconnectedness. Similarly, OMTrade is where individuals come together, uniting in their goal to learn and invest. OMTrade seeks to cultivate a vibrant community where knowledge issharedand wisdom iscollectively amplified. Retail investors learn trading skills and crypto knowledge from pro traders, while traders in turn benefit financially and socially from the increased AUC (Asset Under Copy), thanks to promoters’ efforts of discovering the best performers. “Many social, interactive features will gradually roll out to make OMTrade a more entertaining place to trade and win together,” says Michael, “and artificial intelligence will play a vital part in superseding the text-heavy nature of crypto trading nowadays with more voices and interactive videos.” The future of the OM platform, according to the founding team, is anopen community led by crypto-native traders, influencers, and researchers while being governed by a bottom-up DAO of grassroots retail investors. Why Us? The founder of OM Trade, Michael Lee, has been a successful veteran trader in commodities and FX. Michael found his trading talents when he won several world-class prizes in global trading competitions. Later, he co-founded one of the top 10 copy trading platforms in the Asia Pacific. During his trading career, Michael found immense value in learning from fellow traders and began to ponder how to marry trading with social. In 2016, Michael started actively trading Bitcoin, where he grasped the liberating power of blockchain and cryptocurrency. Since then, Michael has been an avid early investor in many of crypto’s top projects, including some of CMC’s Top 15-ranked public blockchains and one global top 3 centralized exchange. As an investor, he has been closely connected with major crypto founders in the US, EU, Japan, Korea, and Greater China. In 2022, STEPN’s breakout rekindled Michael’s passion: make trading social and accessible for everyone. Through his early investment and in-depth participation in STEPN, Michael witnessed the power of anorganic community, and how such a community changed the lives of many of its members for the better. The Gamestop saga, where Wall Street Bet retail investors defeated professional hedge fund managers through unified actions on eToro and Robinhood, further convinced Michael to crystallize his long-time career dream - OM Trade. “In the long run,” said Michael, “we want all of our users to find their clans on OM Trade - their spiritual home, just like many people do with their subreddits.” Ready to Roll Besides Michael, OMTrade is in the great hands of a strong tech team. Core members’ past experiences include a Forbes 30 under 30 serial entrepreneur, a full-stack developer who led 20+ Defi/NFT projects, and main architects of a world top 5 exchange’s futures trading department. Michael’s operations team is supported by many renowned traders, crypto influencers, and investors. Last but not least, OMTrade has acquired an Australian crypto exchange license, and appointed a highly-renowned compliance officer, who served many ASX-listed companies in financial services and crypto businesses.

We have reported in all the possible places to be reported to no avail. Later the Ministry of Education will come with a contravention order. How can a school be rendered to a market?“And they are vicious. My Aunt is 70 years old and afraid of them now. They first promised to leave when the LGA came with my agent, but then they failed. Then the LGA also relented. There is nothing we have not done. We petitioned the LGA and LCDA, Tunde Sosina,” she wrote in two separate posts.Govt evacuates illegal stallsBarely 18 hours after Awokoya’s post, state officials came to the school premises and removed the stalls and kiosks around the drainage setback.The state Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Tokunbo Wahab, in a post made via his X handle, on Thursday, said he gave the directive and urged the school principal to take over the school setback.He wrote, “As I instructed, illegal kiosks built on drainage setbacks beside Silver Spring Schools, Abaranje Road, Ikotun were earlier today evacuated by the Lagos State Waste Management Authority enforcement team and the Lagos State Ministry of Environment monitoring officers.“The monitoring officers were directed to request the principal of the school to take over the setback and then beautify it in accordance with the ‘ Greener Lagos’ policy of the Babajide Sanwo-Olu-led administration.”Responding to this, Awokoya posted on Thursday, “Wow! I truly can’t believe this. I cried out here yesterday about illegal kiosks that are erected in front of my aunty’s school in Ikotun and right now they are being evacuated.“Dear Tokunbo Wahab, this is an uncommon favour sir. My aunt just called me to let me know. I am grateful to LASEPA and its General Manager, Tunde Ajayi. Lagos is working. Please Oliver Twist needs a little more help. Theokadasthat are always parking in front of the school entrance should find another bus stop.“My aunty was getting so frustrated that she was thinking of selling the school and just keeping her flagship school in Surulere. The (school) expansion led her into a problem. Now, the Ministry of Environment has asked that we beautify immediately and my aunt is a flower lover so I am sure she will get cracking immediately.”Related NewsGovernorship Election Live UpdatesDangote equips Lagos schools with solar power, othersAlcohol intake before surgery heightens bleeding, pneumonia risks – Surgeons6 ways to stop addictive gamblingResidents lament setbacks takeoverWhen our correspondent visited the school on Friday morning, he observed that the stalls had indeed been cleared and there were no more encroachments on the school fence.A resident who gave his name only as Tunji commended the move which he said should not have happened if there had been strict enforcement.“The stalls were removed yesterday and their owners have been forced to move elsewhere. They constituted much distraction to the students and the school surrounding was beginning to look ugly. Most of the people who patronised them were outsiders and if care hadn’t been taken, the whole place would have become a hideout for hoodlums. This should never have been in the first place if there had been strict enforcements,” he stated.Invaded by alcohol-selling traders, gambling boothsAnother resident of the area, Tobi Fagbemi, lamented that the setbacks of other secondary schools in Ikotun have been taken over by those hawking alcoholic beverages and gamblers.“These traders have taken over all the setbacks in most of the secondary schools. Especially the Ikotun High School. It started gradually and now if you go around these schools, you will see people hawking herbal concoctions and alcohol in sachets. They also have gambling (Baba Ijebu) and sports betting kiosks.“During school hours, you will see these students who are supposed to be in their classes learning subjects, sneaking out to hang around these joints. Even after closing hours, they still go there to spend their pocket money, and you’ll see them sipping alcohol in sachets. The government has to ban these shops around schools,” he told our correspondent.School traders breeding thugs– TeacherA teacher in a private school in Oshodi, Mrs Bukola Adelani, in a chat with our correspondent, expressed worries over the negative effects the presence of alcohol and cigarette vendors can have on students.She said, “This problem is gradually getting out of hand because these traders around schools sell alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and even aphrodisiacs to students. Students go there to take these things and they start misbehaving, sleeping with their colleagues, and becoming violent.“There was a case where a student went to take one of these drinks and he started sleeping in class. This is how substance abuse starts. Who knows what else they are selling to these children that we have not yet discovered? If you go through these markets springing up around schools, you will find that they sell adult materials to underage students.“These vendors know what they are doing. They see students in school uniforms, especially the females among them coming to purchase these things and they don’t object. They will even argue that their gin is a remedy for stomach upset.“The government needs to do something if we are to get rid of the menace of thuggery and drug addiction that is now spreading across schools in the state.”Commenting on the development, an Ikorodu resident, Saheed Lawal, in his reply to Awokoya’s post on X, tweeted, “Go to United Secondary School and Ayangburen Secondary School in Ikorodu. These schools are adjacent to Ikorodu Road at the garage section, but they have all been taken over by people frying akara, clothes, food, ogogoro (local gin distilled from palm wine) sellers. It is absurd passing there every morning.”Another, a project engineer on X, Fayemi Olatunbosun, who stated that he was a part of the team that worked on the ongoing road construction in Abaranje, Ikotun, disclosed that the setbacks were allocated by some community members.“I joined a team of engineers who worked on the aforementioned road. You won’t believe that some people from the community allocated that small portion of the setback to different kiosks at a cost of not less than N30,000. They were doing this even when our work there was ongoing,” he wrote.Government urges collaborationIn a lengthy post on Friday, Wahab, stated that his office had been inundated with numerous complaints from concerned citizens about noise pollution, flooding, and obstruction of walkways by traders.“As a ministry, we continue to act swiftly upon receiving these vital complaints, and we are fully committed to responding promptly and decisively to restore law and order across the state. As the custodians of the state’s environmental well-being, we acknowledge the significance of addressing these concerns with utmost urgency.“Flooding, noise pollution, and the unlawful blockage of walkways represent critical challenges that impact the lives and livelihoods of our citizens. Therefore, the Lagos State Ministry of Environment and Water Resources is diligently organising and implementing a comprehensive action plan to tackle these issues head-on.“This proactive response will involve collaborative efforts among various departments within the Ministry, in conjunction with relevant authorities, to ensure the effective resolution of these environmental challenges. The ministry urges all residents and stakeholders to join hands in this collective endeavour to maintain a clean, safe, and sustainable environment for everyone in Lagos State.”Govt must implement EIA– Environmental researcherAn environmental researcher, Seun Awoyinfa, toldSaturday PUNCHthat the state government needs to implement an Environmental Impact Assessment to tackle the abuse of school setbacks.“For every project, whether it involves erecting a kiosk or structure, especially around a school, an EIA must be carried out. There is no environmental sustainability without an environmental analysis.“For instance, a school should not be close to the marketplace because the noise pollution will affect the level of concentration of the students. They should not be built close to a casino or betting spot otherwise, the intellect of those students is in contention due to that level of distraction.“The same applies to allowing pubs or stores selling stimulants or drugs. They should not be sited close to a school because they could have negative impacts on students. The government should ensure that EIAs are carried out at each LGA and LCDA to curb this,” he advised. Sadly, that is far from the picture cut by the surroundings of Silver Spring Schools in the Ikotun area of Lagos State.For a first-time visitor to the area, it would be difficult to locate the school as it is obscured by a series of stalls and kiosks built close to the drainage, by the school fence.The first impression that comes to mind on getting to the place is that of a fast-expanding local market meant to serve the immediate needs of those living close by.However, a closer look would reveal something more sinister, a melting pot for gamblers and alcoholics.Based on findings made by our correspondent, due to easy access to alcoholic drinks packaged in sachets, students in schools around the area find pleasure in converging at the market to indulge and after getting high, would break into fights, disrupting the peace of the area.How, succour came the way of motorists, residents and business owners, who have over the years complained about the activities of the traders.Officials of the Lagos Waste Management Authority and the state’s Ministry of Environment stormed the area and demolished stalls and kiosks built by the traders on the drainage channel beside the school.Saturday PUNCHlearnt that this development followed a request made by a lawyer and development consultant, Mrs Iyabo Awokoya to the Lagos State Ministry of Education and the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency via her verified X (formerly Twitter) handle on Wednesday.Meanwhile, according to the official internet portal for all schools in the state known as ‘Lagos Schools Online’, the Silver Springs Schools, which is situated at Onitire, Abaranje, was started by its proprietress, Mrs Olaide Fawehinmi in 2001.The school, our correspondent gathered, has about 105 students and has another college located in Ijeshatedo, Surulere.In a photograph of the school, which Awokoya appended to her post, an array of wooden kiosks and umbrellas owned by traders could be seen adjoining the fence erected by the school.The traders who ranged from Point-of-Sale operators to those who hawked snacks and pastries had their merchandise placed over the drainage channel, beside the school building.Findings bySaturday PUNCHrevealed that in the past few years, through various press releases, the Lagos State Government had expressed worries over the increasing abuse of setbacks and incidental open spaces around public schools and has sought to check such infractions.In a series of replies to comments elicited by her post on Silver Spring Schools, Awokoya lamented that the shops had repelled parents from registering their children in the school, noting that its premises had been turned into a marketplace.She further disclosed that the efforts of the school proprietress, who is her aunt, to eject the illegal traders had failed and she had even become afraid due to the recalcitrance of the stall owners.The post read, “Dear Lagos State Ministry of Environment, Mr Tokunbo Wahab, LASEPA official, Tunde, Please this is my aunty’s school on Abaranje Road, Ikotun, in Lagos.“See the way the traders have taken over the setback and have erected permanent kiosks even attaching them to the fence.

The India Meteorological Departme… [+1939 chars]",Bangladesh,"IANS The cyclonic storm ' Midhili ,' originating from a deep depression over the Bay of Bengal is set to intensify and is expected to make landfall on the Bangladesh coast. The India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) on Friday reported that the storm will pass near the Sundarbans and is projected to hit the Bangladesh coast with a maximum wind speed of 80 kmph. The cyclonic storm is expected to cross the Bangladesh coast on the night of November 17 or the early hours of November 18. As of 5:30 am on Friday, the system was centred approximately 190 km east of Paradip (Odisha), 200 km south-southeast of Digha (West Bengal), and 220 km southwest of Khepupara (Bangladesh), according to the national weather agency.

The name 'Midhili' was assigned by the Maldives, following the practice of countries affected by cyclones in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, which rotate in giving names to cyclones sequentially. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Cyclone Midhili is not expected to have a significant impact on Odisha, as it is projected to pass more than 150 kilometres from the state's coast. Nevertheless, certain districts such as Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur may experience heavy rainfall on Friday, according to IMD scientist Umashankar Das. In response to the cyclone in the Bay of Bengal, Odisha's Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) has placed all District Collectors on alert, stating, ""We do not want to take any chance and therefore put the state machinery on alert for any eventuality,"" as mentioned by SRC Satyabrata Sahoo . The IMD forecast indicates that coastal districts of West Bengal, including North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah, East Medinipur, and Kolkata, are likely to receive rainfall ranging from 20 mm to 110 mm within 24 hours on Friday. District Magistrate Tanbir Afzal told ANI that special guidelines have been issued for all the blocks in the district. ""The district is awake and alert to the threat posed by Cyclone Midhili. The Block Administrative Officers have been asked to be proactive while directions have been given to close the ferry wharves in the district in the event of heavy rains,"" the DM said. ""Additional vigilance has been arranged in Digha, a coastal resort town in West Bengal popular with tourists. Rescue teams have been mobilised to deal with situations on a war footing.

Princeton researchers and colleagues from around the world documented the effects using trail cameras and animal-tracking devices that had been in use before the storm.Thanks to the extensive network of cameras, GPS collars and other instruments, park staff and wildlife ecologists had an ""unprecedented opportunity"" to assemble a minute-by-minute view of how the storm affected the park and how the animals responded, said Hallie Brown, a postdoctoral research associate in Princeton's Department of Ecology and Environmental Biology and the first author of anew paperinNatureabout the hurricane's impact.""This is the first study that has ever been able to track the real-time responses of a large-mammal community to a natural disaster,"" said Robert Pringle, an EEB professor who has worked with Gorongosa National Park since its inception.Brown, now a postdoctoral research associate in Pringle's lab, was a graduate student at the time with Ryan Long, an associate professor of wildlife sciences at the University of Idaho and a former Princeton postdoc. Long and Pringle shared senior author credits on the new Nature paper.""We watched the waters rise,"" Brown recalled. ""We watched the animals' reactions in the hours, days and weeks after the cyclone: how some of them escaped the floodwaters, and some of them didn't. We used the data we had from before, during and after the storm to create, not just a description of this one event, but a broader set of expectations, so managers can better anticipate the effects of increasingly severe weather events.""The research team found that the best predictor of survival was size. The tiny oribi, about the size of a greyhound, saw its population plummet by 50%. About half of the slightly larger reedbucks died as well. The bushbucks, which are the smallest species that can wear a GPS collar, saw three of its eight collared animals die—the smallest male and the two smallest females—but only lost 4% of their population overall.GPS data revealed that the bushbucks looked for hills to climb, including termite mound hillocks that reach up to 16 feet tall (5 meters) and 65 feet long (20 meters), which became islands in the flood. The researchers saw that one survivor hopscotched from mound to mound, passing quickly through the floodwaters in between, before finding safety in the woods athigher elevations. The four largest herbivores wearing GPS collars—nyala, kudu, sable and elephant—had no fatalities.Mammals in the park range in size from the tiny oribi, which lost half of its population in the wake of Cyclone Idai, to the massive elephants that saw no fatalities from the storm or its aftermath. Credit: Hallie Brown, Princeton UniversityBody size also offered a secondary protection, the researchers found.""Not only could the smaller-sized animals not outpace the waters, they were also not able to buffer the nutritional limitation afterwards,"" said Brown. ""Because the flood was so high for so long, it killed a lot of the grasses and low-lying vegetation. Smaller animals can't withstand those nutritionally limited periods like larger animals, who have more fat to rely on.""The only previous study of hurricane effects on island populations looked at lizards and spiders in the Bahamas and found very similar patterns. ""It's incredible how the patterns we found cross taxonomic and geographic lines,"" said Brown. ""They seem to play out the same ways in our terrestrial ecosystem, with the largest mammals on earth, and with these tiny little invertebrates and reptiles in the Bahamas.""The researchers have two primary recommendations for other wildlife managers: evacuate the smallest and most ecologically vulnerable creatures to safer areas before storms come, and provide supplementary feed after the storm. Once all of the grasses have drowned, animals will turn to foraging on less-nutritious shrubs and bark, and many small creatures can't survive that dietary shift.The few carnivores in the park weathered the storm just fine, Brown said. Thewild dogsand leopards benefited from having their prey animals concentrated in the upland areas, and the lions' primary food source—warthogs—stayed in the uplands for several months but were otherwise largely unaffected by the cyclone.The research team included institutions from five countries: Princeton University; the University of Idaho-Moscow; the University of California-Merced; Montana State University-Bozeman; Yale University; Archbold Biological Station in Venus, Florida; the University of British Columbia-Vancouver; Gorongosa National Park; the University of Kent; the University of the Witwatersrand-Johannesburg; Associação Azul Moçambique in Maputo, Mozambique.Other Princeton authors on the paper are then-graduate students Matt Hutchinson, Ph.D. 2021; Justine Atkins Becker, Ph.D. 2020; Arjun Potter, Ph.D. 2022; and then-NSF postdoctoral fellow Meredith Palmer.""For me, the most exciting thing about this paper is the incredible collaboration between so many groups of researchers, from hydrology to large animal ecology, to create this really integrated piece of science,"" Brown said.

The Fulani dominate the North, the Yoruba have the West, and the Igbo populate the East. Each region and people had their strengths and weaknesses. The land knew peace.But when political iniquity became official, and the supplications of the oppressed minorities rose to the ears of the Most High God, the portion of the land that flows with oil, milk and honey became gazetted as the Niger Delta, a vast treasure that was initially part of the eastern and western regions.And the Lord regretted creating man because the heart of man was perpetually evil. So, the spirit of the Lord hovered upon the face of the waters, inspiring patriots to call traitors to repentance and justice.It came to pass that there arose a mutiny within the Nigerian Army when some young, idealistic officers, mostly from the East, toppled the civilian government of Alhaji Tafawa Balewa, a northerner, who was killed, and an easterner, Major General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, ruled in Balewa’s stead. The January 1966 coup broke the embankment that had dammed the river of hate and suspicion from flooding the country.Six months later, a countercoup executed mainly by Hausa-Fulani soldiers was nicknamed a revenge coup, in which Aguiyi-Ironsi was killed. The fallout of the countercoup fed fodder to the cannons of a Civil War, which boomed between July 6, 1967, and January 13, 1970, as crazed soldiers played football with three million Igbo skulls felled by battlefield bullets, ethnic cleansing and starvation.In anger, the Lord God of Host turned his eyes away from the people and the land, and He allowed jackboots in military uniforms to chastise them with scorpions because the innocent blood of coup victims and Biafrans refused to drain into the earth.Here are the names and surnames of the rulers of Nigeria after the Civil War, in order of their ascension. Yakubu, the son of Gowon; Murtala, the son of Mohammed; Olusegun, the son of Obasanjo; Shehu, the son of Shagari; Muhammadu, the son of Buhari; Ibrahim, the son of Babangida; Ernest, the son Shonekan; Sani, the son of Abacha; and Abdulsalami, the son of Abubakar. All these rulers ruled in the Old Testament.But Babangida was wiser than a snake. Indeed, he was a deceiver extraordinaire. His bright smile has the cooling effect of iodine on a fresh wound, before the stinging pain. For is it not written that Babangida’s regime was the bloodiest in the 63-year history of Nigeria as many soldiers died in alleged coup plots while 163 senior soldiers died in a plane crash on September 28, 1992?“They got me,” were the last words of Dele Giwa, the Editor-in-Chief of Newswatch magazine after a letter bomb blew open his entrails in his Ikeja home on October 19, 1986, shutting his eyes in brutal death. Giwa’s deputy and comrade-in-pen, Ray Ekpu, described the killing as ‘state assassination’, adding that the Friday preceding the Sunday Giwa received the letter bomb, he (Giwa) was grilled by the State Security Service, which accused him of ‘arms importation, planning a socialist revolution, doing a follow-up story on Commodore Ebitu Ukiwe, who had been removed by President Babangida, and planning to employ a former Lagos Police Public Relations Officer, Alozie Ogbugbuaja, who said the expertise of the Nigerian military top brass was in drinking pepper soup and planning coups. Ekpu said Giwa was only guilty of one of the four allegations, that is, planning to employ Ogbugbuaja.After he annulled the June 12 presidential election won by MKO Abiola in 1993, and the backlash thereof was unbearable, Babangida planted on the throne, Sonekan, who was blown out of power by the hot air from the nostrils of Abacha. Abacha ruled for just four and a half years before karma handcuffed and flung him into the bottomless pit reserved for the shameless. Nothing confirms the looting of public treasury by successive Nigerian governments than the unending return of billions of dollars stashed in foreign countries by Abacha. Remember, Abacha spent just four and a half years in the vault and he became the Glutton of All Time!I am a full-blooded Nigerian. I have no family roots in Niger Republic like Buhari, or ancestrial link to Mauritania like Peter Obi’s presidential running mate, Datti Baba-Ahmed. Nigeria is my only home.

If we have enough products, it will bring down these acts of profiteering among marketers,” the National Public Relations Officer, Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, Chief Ukadike Chinedu, told our correspondent.He added, “It is when the products become very difficult to access that is when you start to see cases of profiteering. But if everywhere is littered with products, you won’t experience what we are seeing now.“In Port Harcourt, for instance, our tickets have been tied down. For the past three weeks, we have not been able to load products, leading to queues at the few stations that have products. But the government, which is actually represented in this business by NNPCL, keeps saying that it is expecting stock.”Ukadike noted that though NNPCL had promised to discharge some vessels of PMS at Warri, Lagos and Calabar soon, the products had yet to arrive.This, according to the IPMAN official, was among the reasons private depot owners had raised the cost of their products, leading to the hike in the pump prices of petrol at retail outlets.“We heard that there is a vessel that is coming to Calabar to discharge, so Port Harcourt and other states in the region are still expecting it. Also, we heard that another vessel is going to discharge in Lagos. Warri is also expecting a vessel.“So, with the few depots that have petroleum products now, you will know that there will be serious profiteering and scrambling for PMS. It is, therefore, important for NNPCL vessels to come in with products, particularly as we approach the Yuletide.“But they (NNPCL) have assured us that there will be enough products during the Christmas period,” Ukadike stated, but stressed that the fuel importer did not inform marketers when the expected PMS vessels would arrive.Related NewsGovernorship Election Live UpdatesPetrol tanker falls, spills content in AnambraPalliatives: Niger buys 200 commuter buses, awards contract for 566 km roadsFG may pay N1.68tn fuel subsidy, marketers forecast N900/litreThe oil marketer further stated that the cost of PMS in most states outside Lagos and the South-West was about N650/litre, describing the average price of N640/litre in Abuja is cheap.“The N640/litre price in Abuja is cheap when compared to the N660/litre average price in the South-East. In fact, in Owerri, Imo State, it is N670 and in Anambra it is N700/litre. So, those of you in Abuja are lucky.“Do you know that it is getting close to N800/litre in remote areas in the far North? This is based on reports we receive from our members. That is the situation. There is insufficient supply of products and this often leads to profiteering.”Also speaking on the issue, the Secretary of IPMAN, Abuja-Suleja, Mohammed Shuaibu, stated that though the queues being experienced in some states were due to low supply volumes from NNPCL, it could also be attributed to the forthcoming festive season.“Yes, products are not as readily available as before, which is why many retail stations are not dispensing nowadays. However, you should know that during the festive period towards the end of the year, we always experience queues.“This is why the government should intervene now by flooding the country with products so that those who want to catch-in on the season to profiteer would not be able to do so,” Shuaibu stated.However, the Chief Corporate Communications Officer of NNPCL, Olufemi Soneye, told our correspondent that the position of oil marketers as regards the re-emergence of fuel queues was not true.“That is not true. The recent tightness in Abuja is essentially a price war, which is typical of any competitive market. Motorists would rather queue at filling stations that offer lower prices than others.“While NNPC retail is selling at N613/litre in Abuja, other marketers’ prices range from N625-N650/litre,” Soneye stated.Meanwhile, it was observed that while the queues at NNPCL stations were longer, similar scenarios played out in Conoil and Total filling stations opposite the Abuja headquarters of NNPCL, and other outlets across the capital city and its neighbouring states. The NNPCL, which is the sole importer of the product, refuted the oil marketers’ claim, attributing the queues in the affected areas, particularly Abuja, to “price war”.The queues for petrol at filling stations in Abuja and its neighbouring states in particular, as well as some South-East and South-South states, have persisted in the past few weeks.“The queues have continued because there is an insufficient supply of products.

He added, “It is when the products become very difficult to access that is when you start to see cases of profiteering. “In Port Harcourt, for instance, our tickets have been tied down. Ukadike noted that though NNPCL had promised to discharge some vessels of PMS at Warri, Lagos and Calabar soon, the products had yet to arrive.This, according to the IPMAN official, was among the reasons private depot owners had raised the cost of their products, leading to the hike in the pump prices of petrol at retail outlets.“We heard that there is a vessel that is coming to Calabar to discharge, so Port Harcourt and other states in the region are still expecting it. This, according to the IPMAN official, was among the reasons private depot owners had raised the cost of their products, leading to the hike in the pump prices of petrol at retail outlets.“We heard that there is a vessel that is coming to Calabar to discharge, so Port Harcourt and other states in the region are still expecting it. “We heard that there is a vessel that is coming to Calabar to discharge, so Port Harcourt and other states in the region are still expecting it. “So, with the few depots that have petroleum products now, you will know that there will be serious profiteering and scrambling for PMS. “But they (NNPCL) have assured us that there will be enough products during the Christmas period,” Ukadike stated, but stressed that the fuel importer did not inform marketers when the expected PMS vessels would arrive.Related NewsGovernorship Election Live UpdatesPetrol tanker falls, spills content in AnambraPalliatives: Niger buys 200 commuter buses, awards contract for 566 km roadsFG may pay N1.68tn fuel subsidy, marketers forecast N900/litreThe oil marketer further stated that the cost of PMS in most states outside Lagos and the South-West was about N650/litre, describing the average price of N640/litre in Abuja is cheap.“The N640/litre price in Abuja is cheap when compared to the N660/litre average price in the South-East.

<ul><li>Urban waterfronts are neglected in many Am… [+9029 chars]",News,"On a sunny, 80-degree Saturday afternoon in late October, Mia Olis left her home in Chelsea to soak up the rays on Manhattan's brand-new — and so far only — public beach. Raised in Hawaii, Olis loves the water and surfing. But Rockaway Beach — more than an hour away by subway — was too far a trek that day. The 1,200 tons of sand near Greenwich Village along the Hudson river would have to do. ""I love that everybody's here,"" Olis, a 40-year-old lawyer, said while perched on a towel in a bikini. But she noted the park sits in a ritzy neighborhood, and thought it felt a little exclusive. ""I wish it were more accessible to everybody else from uptown, Harlem, the Bronx."" Still, she said, any new green space in New York is cause for celebration. Urban waterways can be a huge asset to cities and their residents. Rivers, lakes, canals, and ocean beaches can attract new residents, visitors, and commercial development. If they're well-designed, they can make cities more inclusive and help protect them from storms and heatwaves. Waterfronts are also just nice places to be. People are naturally drawn to them, as manya poetand sociologist has pointed out. And they'll alsopay a premium to live by them. Economists say cities with struggling downtowns should invest in their green space — and that includes opening up waterfronts. ""Places that have better natural amenities — they tend to do better. They attract more people, they attract more jobs, they have higher economic growth,"" said Amanda Weinstein, a professor of economics at the University of Akron. But they have to be made accessible. ""It's the investment in that natural amenity that matters."" While the breeze off the Hudson offered some respite on that unusually warm fall day, a dip in the water would've been an even better way to cool off. But there's no public pool nearby, andno sanctioned river swim spotsin the city. Even if the Hudsonwas consistently clean enough to swim in, it would take a lot to convince many New Yorkers to dive in. ""It would be a really big leap for me to swim in it,"" said Karin Balow, a 58-year-old Inwood resident who grew up along the river upstate. She traveled from her Upper Manhattan home to check out the new beach, where she settled into an Adirondack chair with a book. ""But it has come a long, long way. So who knows?"" New York City has done a lot to invest in its 520 miles of waterfront. The sandy bluff on Gansevoort peninsula is part of the much larger Hudson River park and looks out over Little Island,a whimsical, highly instagrammable transformationof Pier 55. Hoards of people crowded the winding, tree-lined paths up to the island's breezy observation deck on that October day. If they read the signage, they'd know the city's garbage used to be incinerated where they stood. The park — the borough's second-largest — is credited withhelping revitalize Manhattan's west side. Over the last couple of decades, New York has built a series of iconic waterfront parks on former industrial sites like Brooklyn Bridge Park and Domino Park in Brooklyn, Battery Park and the East River park in Manhattan, and Gantry State Plaza Park and Astoria Park in Queens. Governor's island now features manmade hills with sweeping skyline views, urban farming, and glamping. And the East River might soon geta massive floating pool. Cities across the country are increasingly looking to transform their neglected waterfronts in an effort to bring people back downtown. Cleveland, Ohio, isworking on a planfor a new beach, housing, and park space on the shores of Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River. Seattle has torn down an elevated freeway downtown to make way for a waterfront park. A couple hundred miles south of Manhattan, the waters off the shores of the nation's capital are also finding new life. In recent years, DC has opened up its waterfront,transforming the southwestwith the glitzy Wharf — featuring luxury condos, restaurants, music venues, and a soccer stadium, and redeveloping the Capitol riverfrontfrom Navy Yardto Buzzard Point with the Nationals baseball stadium and tons of new housing. The city just recently finished its decade-long construction of two major tunnels that capture stormwater, preventingalmost all sewage from overflowinginto the Anacostia river during storms and easing flooding in low-lying neighborhoods. For the first time in over a half century, the city is planning to open the Anacostia river next June for a sanctioned swimming event. The splash event was supposed to happen in July, and then September of this year, but was postponed twice due to severe storms. Urban waterways like the Hudson and Anacostia pose aserious flooding threatto cities as climate change triggers rising sea levels and more ferocious storms. Waterfront parks can helpin collecting storm surge and rainwater and preventing flooding. They can also offer respite as summers get hotter. Cities — built of heat-absorbing asphalt and concrete, instead of cooling greenery —make heatwaves even worse. International climate experts warn heat-related deaths globallycould more than quadrupleby mid-century if the planet heats up to 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels. A cool breeze off a river or lake, or a dip in one, could save lives. ""There is a very real need in cities,"" said Trey Sherard, the riverkeeper at the DC non-profit Anacostia Riverkeeper, which is organizing the June swim event. ""It's not just recreation, it's public health to be able to cool off that way."" Climate resilience is also key to building more equitable cities. Communities of color and lower-income neighborhoods across the countryare disproportionately impactedby environmental impacts, like flooding and extreme heat.In the DC area, the vast majority of homes most vulnerable to floodingare in Ward 7 and Prince George's County, Maryland, both of which are majority Black. VIDEO: Thousands of people take to the beaches of Rio de Janeiro to cool off as a heatwave strikes parts of Brazil in the middle of spring. According to the Alerta Rio system, the maximum temperature recorded on Sunday was 42.5 degrees Celsius in Iraja.pic.twitter.com/vVJ9elwcss There are also historic inequities when it comes to swimming. Public pools across the country were largely racially segregated until the 1950s — and after that, manyprivate poolsopened to cater to white people fleeing desegregation. Without safe and clean rivers and lakes to turn to, Black communities across the country often didn't have anywhere to take a dip or teach their kids to swim. DC's Black communities still face many of these challenges. The free swimming lessons that the city department of parks and recreation offers can't meet the high demand and don't cater to adults. ""There's a lot of water fear in DC, especially east of the river. And that speaks to generations being separated from their waterways,"" Sherard said. Sherard said the Anacostia's inaugural swim event is being modeled after one on the Charles River in Boston. But he also pointed to international models. In Switzerland's biggest city, Zurich, swimmers can hop into the Limmat river or Lake Zurich right downtown. The most enthusiastic locals in Zurich and Bernswim to and from workwith their phone, wallet, and clothes strapped to them ina floating waterproof satchel. Paris is poised toopen up its Seine River to swimmersfor the first time in 100 years. Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who's something ofa global urbanist hero, has pioneered a billion-dollar effort to clean up the iconic river in time to hold Olympic events in it next summer. Skepticism abounds about how clean the murky depths of the Anacostia are. Sherard said he hears plenty of ""hell no, never"" when it comes to swimming in the river, but he's also found real enthusiasm for opening the river up. There's lots of work left to do. Advocates for the river want Congress to approve funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the Anacostia to remove toxic sediment and ease flooding. If the river is dredged, it could also be a huge boost for the country's first African American boating club —Seafarers Yacht Club— whose boathouse on the river's west bank is only accessible in high tide because of accumulated sediment. ""What a gem to have on the river,"" Sherard said.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'ghana', 'southafrica', 'southafrica', 'colombia', 'colombia', 'colombia', 'colombia', 'colombia', 'sierraleone', 'brazil', 'brazil', 'switzerland', 'switzerland', 'switzerland', 'france']",us,True,True

News and Media Division . New York 17 November 2023 The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General. **Climate Briefing Good afternoon, and it is indeed Friday. Just to give you a heads up that on Monday, ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP28), which, as you know, is taking place in the United Arab Emirates, our friends at the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) will officially launch their annual Emissions Gap Report for 2023. That launch will take place at 9 a.m. Joining the launch in person will be the Secretary-General of these United Nations, who will present the report, and yes, he will take some questions. You're welcome. He will be joined virtually by Inger Andersen, UNEP's Executive Director, and Anne Olhoff, the Chief Scientific Editor of the Emissions Gap Report. That will be at 9 a.m., here on Monday. We will share with you over the weekend all sorts of embargoed materials, so we can ruin your weekend and you could work. **Gaza Back here, Martin Griffiths, our Emergency Relief Coordinator, briefed Member States this morning on the situation in Gaza. He said it is without doubt a humanitarian crisis that, by any measure, is intolerable and cannot continue. In many respects, he said, international humanitarian law appears to have been turned on its head. Natalie Boucly, the Deputy Commissioner General of UNRWA (UN Relief and Works Agency), also briefed Member States and said that UNRWA is focusing on improving existing shelter capacity, but warned that there is simply not enough food, water and fuel to sustain life in Gaza. The Agency's work, she said, has become ""a mission impossible"". Dr. Tedros [Adhanom Ghebreyesus], the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), for his part, said that the health needs of the people of Gaza are growing all the time, and the health system is near collapse. Also briefing was Volker Türk, the High Commissioner for Human Rights. He said his Office has scaled up its engagement, stressing the importance of full access to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including all parts of Gaza, for the Human Rights Office, to ensure that it can carry out independent monitoring and documentation and protection coordination without hindrance. Also briefing, and that meeting is still going on, were the heads of UNDP (United Nations Development Programme), UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund), and representatives of UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) and UN-Women. Just to give you a bit more granularity on the situation on the ground: UNRWA announced that, due to the communication shutdown and lack of fuel, there will not be any cross-border aid operation at the Rafah Crossing today, as it will be impossible to manage or coordinate humanitarian aid convoys. By yesterday evening, no aid trucks had entered through the Rafah Crossing. This is due to the backlog of aid from previous days that has not been transported without fuel. UNRWA used the fuel provided on 15 November to operate trucks and forklifts to clear the backlogs, but fuel has run out again. Yesterday afternoon, Gaza's telecommunications services shut down after the providing companies announced that fuel used to run generators had been depleted. Humanitarian agencies and first responders have warned that blackouts jeopardise the safety of civilians and the provision of life-saving assistance. That is the update from UNRWA. **Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory Also, linked to the situation on the ground, the Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, Rosemary DiCarlo, started today a visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. She will be there over the weekend for talks with Israeli and Palestinian officials on, obviously, what is going on. During the three-day visit — she is travelling today but gets underway on Sunday, 19 November — she will have consultations with Israeli officials in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, as well as with Palestinian interlocutors in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. She will also be meeting with Jordanian officials, and we will update you on her visit. **Deputy Secretary-General's Travel Amina Mohammed, for her part, our Deputy Secretary-General, will be in London on Monday, 20 November, to participate in the Global Food Security Summit, hosted by the Government of the United Kingdom. She will also deliver a keynote address on Women's Advancement and Role in Tackling Climate Change at the Christian Aid Annual Lecture 2023. And on the invitation of the Government of Senegal, she will be in Senegal on Thursday, 27 November, to attend the Inauguration of the UN House, just outside of Dakar. She will be back in New York on 27 November. **Sudan A number of you had reached out to me last night regarding Sudan, and I just want to tell you that I can confirm that we have indeed received a letter from the Government of Sudan announcing the Government's decision to ""terminate UNITAMS [UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan]"" — which is our special political mission in Sudan. The letter says that they are ""terminating UNITAMS with immediate effect"". They also communicated their commitment to engage constructively with the Security Council and with us, the [United Nations] Secretariat, on a new, appropriate and agreed-upon formula. As you will recall, the political mission, UNITAMS, was established by the Security Council pursuant to resolution 2524 (2020) in June 2020 and its current mandate ends on 3 December of this year. As mentioned in the Security Council briefing yesterday by Assistant Secretary-General, Martha Pobee, the Secretary-General has appointed Ian Martin to lead a strategic review of the UN Mission in Sudan to provide the Security Council with options on how to adapt the Mission's mandate. And I also want to announce an appointment that has been in the works for some time now. The Secretary-General is also appointing Ramtane Lamamra, of Algeria, as his Personal Envoy for Sudan. We will continue to engage closely with all actors, including the Sudanese authorities and members of the Security Council, to clarify next steps. As you know, of course, it is the Security Council that gives the Secretariat the mandate to operate peacebuilding, political missions and peacekeeping missions. **Security Council The Security Council this morning held ameetingon threats to international peace and security. Briefing Council members from the Secretariat was Ilze Brands Kehris, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights. She said that the impact of the war in Ukraine extends beyond the high casualties and broad physical destruction, reaching deep into the fabric of Ukrainian society. She noted that tensions between the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which has historic links to the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church, and the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, increased following the Russian Federation's full-scale armed attack in February of last year, in some cases manifesting itself in violent incidents. Ms. Kehris said that these tensions have affected the freedom of religion in the territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine, as documented in consecutive recent Human Rights Monitoring [Mission] reports, adding that the UN Human Rights Office also has serious concerns about freedom of religion in Ukrainian territory occupied by the Russian Federation, which could also be considered discriminatory. Her full remarks have been shared with you. **Southern and Eastern Africa A quick update from our Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, Joyce Msuya, who has wrapped up a three-week mission to southern and eastern Africa, as the climate crisis there drives humanitarian needs ever higher. She met with impacted communities — as well as officials, members of the UN community and NGOs (non-governmental organizations), civil society, regional organizations, the private sector, and international financial institutions. Her travels took her to Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya and Botswana. In her meetings, she stressed the UN's commitment to standing with the people and Governments of the region as they continue to confront climate shocks — saying that at COP 28, the rest of the world must make clear that these countries won't face these challenges alone. **Ethiopia Turning to Ethiopia: Our humanitarian friends [UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs] tell us that more than 760,000 people in the country have now been impacted by heavy rains, floods and landslides. More than 40 deaths have been reported — and many areas remain difficult or impossible to access due to damaged roads and bridges. We, along with our partners, are supporting the Government-led humanitarian response in the regions of Somali, Oromia, Afar and in the southwest, as well. But resources and capacities are indeed limited, and a scale-up is urgently needed to meet surging needs. Humanitarian partners have so far distributed food and non-food items to more than 8,000 families impacted by the floods. **Democratic Republic of the Congo Moving to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where we can tell you there has been an upsurge of attacks against civilians in Ituri province, in the country's east — and that is according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). According to our humanitarian partners, at least 46 civilians were reportedly killed by armed groups in the Irumu and Mambasa territories between 31 October and 9 November. Some 28,000 people fled into surrounding areas in the two territories. Since the beginning of the year, more than 770 civilians have been killed across the province and more than 500,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. We and our partners are providing vital aid, including shelter support, food and water, but we need additional resources to respond to the new displacements. OCHA calls on provincial authorities to reinforce the security of civilians, especially in the Boga and Lolwa areas, where people have been returning to their communities since July. The persistence of insecurity could discourage people from returning to their homes and lead to massive population movements and growing humanitarian needs. **Ukraine And I have a note from Ukraine, which I should have read earlier; our humanitarian colleagues tell us that intense attacks on frontline areas are continuing. There have been reports of deaths and extensive damage to homes and infrastructure, including energy and medical facilities. According to humanitarian partners who were at the sites of the attacks, on 15 November, a strike in the Donetsk Region, in the east of the country, reportedly destroyed and damaged a multistorey building and nearby homes in Selydove, with residents trapped under the rubble. Government officials say that after a two-day rescue operation, four residents were reported killed, and six others were wounded. On the same day, in the southeast, Government officials say that an attack in the Zaporizhzhia Region killed and injured nine residents and rescuers who were responding as a second strike hit. The blast left more than 400 residents exposed to harsh weather conditions as the temperature dropped. National NGOs are mobilized and delivered emergency shelter materials to both locations. Also, an update on convoys: Today, an inter-agency convoy delivered vital aid to frontline areas in the Donetsk Region. Nearly 30 tonnes of aid — including thermal blankets, sleeping bags, solar lamps, medical kits and family hygiene kits — will help people get through the coming cold period amid continuing disruptions of electricity that we are seeing in the region. **Guatemala Also, I have been asked earlier today about the situation in Guatemala, and I can tell you that the Secretary-General is alarmed by the latest prosecutorial actions taking place in Guatemala. He reiterates his call on the authorities to guarantee that the democratic will expressed through the polls is respected and to refrain from acts that may undermine the democratic process or that could constitute reprisals for exercising human rights. **Haiti From Haiti, our humanitarian colleagues tell us that they are deeply concerned about clashes, which erupted on Monday between armed groups in the neighbourhood of Cité Soleil and its surroundings, and that is in the capital, Port-au-Prince. There were reportedly many casualties, as well as incidents of sexual violence, the burning of houses and serious human rights violations. A hospital was the scene of a gunfight — and that's the Hospital de Fontaine. The gunfight obviously disrupted medical services and violating basic humanitarian principles. Dozens of women, children and newborns had to be evacuated. As we have said on numerous occasions, all around the world, health facilities must always be protected, and civilians never be targeted. Yesterday, our acting Humanitarian Coordinator, Bruno Maes, met with families, children and medical staff of this hospital who have evacuated to a safer neighbourhood. The hospital has since closed. Under the leadership of the UN's Humanitarian Coordinator, OCHA is working with UN agencies and our partners to provide assistance and to protect those impacted by the violence. **International Days A few international days for you. Tomorrow is the World Day for the Prevention of and Healing from Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Violence. Sunday is the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. In hismessage, the Secretary-General calls on all to join forces to make roads safer for everyone, everywhere. And on Sunday, it is World Toilet Day. In hismessage, the Secretary-General says that billions of people are still cut off from sanitation services around all the world. To meet the 2030 deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), he underscores that we need to move five times faster to deal with this. I'm not going to ask twice, or once... [Laughter] **Questions and Answers Question: A question on Sudan. In terms of UNITAM's mission, how many staff do you have? And do you think there's a potential of a withdrawal similar to what we're seeing in Mali? Spokesman: First of all, you know, there's a strategic review that is ongoing, and we will inform the Security Council of next steps. Right? The mandate, the permission to operate these missions comes from the Security Council. So the permission to terminate them needs to come from the Security Council, as well. On staffing, the number of civilians is about 200, for the mission itself is about 245. There's, of course, a large humanitarian presence, which is not part of our... but I'll double check on the numbers for you. Serife? Question: Thank you, Stéphane. I actually have a question on the developments on the south of Gaza. So, Israel's Spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that they do not rule out an operation to the south of the Gaza Strip and also the Israeli chief of staff, he said that, as far as we are concerned, more and more regions will be targeted, and Israel has dropped leaflets across parts of Southern Gaza, calling on civilians to evacuate and head towards known shelters. But Israel had indicated that the south of Gaza was supposedly safe. It seems that the Government and the military are giving out signals that they may head to the south. Is the UN following this? And what's your reaction? Are you worried? Spokesman: Yes, and yes. Of course, we're following it. I would encourage you also to look back at everything that was said in the General Assembly meeting this morning. I mean, I think whether it's Volker Türk or Martin Griffiths and Natalie Boucly from UNRWA, I think gave a pretty grim picture of what is going on. We're obviously very concerned about further operations southbound by the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) and the impact that would have on civilians. But as everybody has been saying from the UN side, there's really no place in Gaza that's actually very safe. Question: I mean, telling the civilians to evacuate, where can they go? Is there any possibility for them? Spokesman: My answer to you is that there's... at this point, there's no place in Gaza that is safe. And again, we've been calling on the Israelis, continue to call them to protect civilians at all cost. Spokesman: Dennis, yes. And then, Dulcie. Question: Early today, there were reports that from the head of Al Shifa Hospital that all the patients of intensive care units died because of the blockade. So what's your comment on that? And does the UN have any pre-position on that particular hospital? Because it's in fact the main hospital in the area? [Cross talk] Spokesman: Yeah, I mean, we haven't had... we haven't been able to do an assessment mission to the hospital because of safety concerns at this point. But we're obviously following the situation, getting reports, and the situation there is extremely concerning for the medical staff and most importantly for the patients themselves. And we reiterate yet once again the need for hospitals never to be used in combat. Dulcie, please? Question: Yeah. Where will the new special envoy for Sudan be based? Spokesman: He'll be a personal envoy which is... the terminology matters. He's not... he's a personal envoy. I assume he'll either be based out of Algiers, where he lives, or will find a UN duty station. Question: So he probably won't be based in Sudan? Spokesman: No. He will not be based in Sudan. Question: Okay. And over on Gaza. So what is the UN's understanding on why the IDF are now threatening Southern Gaza? Spokesman: You have to ask them what their motivation is. I mean, and they've spoken, I think they've been very clear, but it's not... I mean, we understand the same thing that you understand, which is public statements, but it's not for me to speak for them. So is the UN arranging some sort of contingency plan with Egypt to let these civilians, who are now threatened in the south...? Spokesman: The aim should be for Palestinians to be safe in Gaza, for civilians to be safe in Gaza. No one, and I think we've been very clear on that, is advocating for a mass displacement of Palestinian civilians out of Gaza. People should be safe in their homes. And if I may just... at what point will the UN or would the UN actually declare this a genocide? Because obviously a lot of experts, including special rapporteurs, are suggesting we're now at that stage. So where is the UN on this thinking? Spokesman: Well, I mean, it depends what part of the UN you mean. I can only speak for the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General does not have the legal authority to declare a situation of genocide. For us, it has to be... that determination has to be made by competent by court, as we've been saying. So, others have their opinion. Question: So which court do you...? Spokesman: I need... I mean, I can give you more details, but it would have to be a competent judicial authority, court. And we've done some math. So out of the number I gave you, is the total staffing for the UN mission. In country, in Port Sudan, there are 88 UN staff members that remain. Okay? The rest are either in Addis or in Nairobi. Okay — 88. But also to add that we have a much less... there's also a large humanitarian presence. But in terms of the political mission, that's the number. Question: Thank you. Spokesman: Margaret Besheer? Question: Hi, Steph. First of all, on the fuel, Israel says today that they're going to allow some fuel in. I'm a little confused. I'm not sure I understand the details. Is it two fuel tankers they're giving to you guys? Or is it more... do you have an idea on details on size that the... the volume, I should say? Spokesman: The only detail is what we've heard, I mean, at least what I've heard on in the media, which is two fuel tankers per day, which in itself is obviously barely a drop in the bucket of what we need to of the amount of fuel that we need. But we're trying to get more details and our colleagues at OCHA and UNRWA are working on that. Question: And have they said if there's restrictions on it? Because what I've seen reported from our colleagues in the region is that it was... it's for UNRWA to use for sewage facilities. So would you consider that a restriction on like... the way they said for aid convoys before. [Cross talk] Spokesman: Again, I think my understanding and your understanding are the same, and that's based on media reports. We're trying to get more details. I would encourage your colleagues in the region to, in fact, be touch with my colleagues in the region because they will have the more first-hand information. I'll kind of just ask one more whether you know it or not. [Laughing] Are there any guarantees on the length like, how many? Is this indefinite? Is it for a one day, five days? I mean... Spokesman: No, again, same answer as before. And just one more. Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo's trip to the region, you mentioned she's meeting with Jordanian officials also, but does that mean she's going Jordan to do it? Or are they meeting her in Ramallah or something? Spokesman: Ad I was reading the note, I was asking myself the same question. So I will give you an answer to that. Have a good weekend. Spokesman: You, too. Miriam? Question: Thank you, Steph. My question is in regards to the special coordinator for Afghanistan report. Did the Secretary-General see if the report in... was the report sent to Security Council? Is there going to be a meeting? And also, what did the Secretary-General think about the report itself and any future plans in regards to meeting with the special rapporteur... not rapporteur, the country's representative in regards to Afghanistan's meeting in Qatar or somewhere else? Nothing to share with you on a possible meeting in Qatar. I will ask. My understanding is that there may be a meeting scheduled in December to consider the special coordinator's report, which I think has been shared with the Council. And it is his... I don't have the... Secretary-General does not have an opinion to proffer on that. Any other questions? Otherwise, I... Go ahead, Dennis. Question: Just a follow-up on Al Shifa Hospital. Are you going to make fact finding mission on... [Cross talk] Spokesman: Well, I mean, it's... I think we're trying to get some... let me put it this way, we're trying to get some of our own eyeballs onto the situation, but that has not yet been possible. Okay. I wish you all a great weekend. If we're in touch over the weekend, that will not be good.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'not found', 'not found', 'not found', 'not found', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'poland', 'senegal', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'sudan', 'algeria', 'algeria', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'russia', 'russia', 'mozambique', 'tanzania', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'botswana', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'democraticrepublicofthecongo', 'democraticrepublicofthecongo', 'democraticrepublicofthecongo', 'democraticrepublicofthecongo', 'congo', 'guatemala', 'guatemala', 'haiti', 'egypt', 'jordan', 'afghanistan', 'afghanistan', 'qatar', 'qatar']",us,True,False

Heavy rains also were reported in Haiti, where the Civil Protection Agency told The Associated Press late Friday that two people had died after being swept away by floods in the country's western Grand'Anse region. The disturbance was about 85 miles (135 kilometers) northeast of Montego Bay, Jamaica, with top winds of 35 mph (55 mph) Friday night. It was moving northeast at 17 mph (28 kph), according to the US National Hurricane Center in Miami. Forecasters had said earlier in the day that the disturbance could become a tropical cyclone, but late Friday they said that was now considered unlikely, though they warned its rains remained a danger. Some 14,000 customers lost power in Jamaica after heavy rains downed trees, severed power lines and caused landslides, according to the Jamaica Public Service Company. At least 24 people were rescued from floodwaters in the island's southeastern region, according to the Jamaican Defense Force. A tropical storm watch remained in effect for Haiti, but watches were discontinued for eastern Cuba, the southeastern Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The disturbance was expected to move across southeast Cuba during the night and the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands on Saturday. Up to 16 inches (40 centimeters) of rain were expected for parts of Jamaica, southeast Cuba, southern Haiti and the Dominican Republic through Sunday, with forecasters warning of mudslides and flash flooding.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'jamaica', 'jamaica', 'jamaica', 'jamaica', 'haiti', 'haiti', 'haiti', 'cuba', 'cuba', 'cuba', 'bahamas', 'bahamas']",in,False,False

Since the beginning of November, more than 795,000 displacements have been recorded in Somalia. Many of the affected, particularly in the southern and central parts of the country, were already internally displaced due to conflict and drought. Homes have been extensively damaged or destroyed and, in some locations, people are sheltering under trees on higher ground. There are also tragic reports of drownings. In Ethiopia's Somali Region, authorities estimate more than 20 people have died, while over half a million people have been affected by flash floods. Close to 40,000 families, or around 240,000 people, including those seeking safety from ongoing conflict in Somalia, have been displaced, more than half of them in the Dollo Ado and Bokolmayo districts. Across five settlements, 213,000 refugees have also suffered the effects of the flooding. Clean and safe drinking water is scarce, accessing health services is difficult and nearly 1,000 families have lost their shelters. In spite of such hardships, many refugees have made generous contributions to support members of the host communities who have also been impacted by the heavy rains. Nearly 25,000 people in Kenya's Dadaab refugee camps have been affected by the floods, with many seeking refuge in schools within the camps as well as in nearby communities. Some refugees have also opened up their homes to host the newly displaced, leading to overcrowding in many households. Flooded roads have hindered the movement of people, making it particularly difficult for vulnerable people to access services, including for pregnant women to reach hospitals. In Kakuma camp, 100 families were forced to move to safer areas due to massive soil erosion from the rains. Beyond displacement, people's livelihoods have been gravely affected. In one location in southern Ethiopia, over 65 percent of the land is reportedly covered by flood waters. Meanwhile, over 1,000 livestock have died, and another 1,000 hectares of crops have been wiped out in the Somali Region, risking the worsening of an already dire food situation. The sanitation situation is greatly concerning as hundreds of communal latrines have been damaged, putting people at risk of infectious diseases, including cholera. In addition, many roads have been ruined, impacting people's access to critical services such as health. People's most immediate needs are for food, emergency shelter, kitchen sets, blankets and other relief items, clean water and hygiene services. Families living in flood-prone areas also need urgent support to relocate to higher grounds. UNHCR and partners are distributing relief items to the newly displaced, as well as dignity kits to affected women and girls. Families are also receiving cash assistance to buy local building materials to repair or reinforce shelters and meet other urgent needs. Sandbags have been provided to protect people from flood waters. Urgent donor support is needed to deliver assistance and protection and to save lives as the rains continue, and as the impact of climate change is felt by the most vulnerable. The floods come barely months after the longest and most severe drought on record, the impacts of which are still being felt by millions of people in the East and Horn of Africa.","['ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia']",us,False,False

CHIJIOKE IREMEKA reportsResidentsof Ikorodu community in the Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State have lamented the impact of strange rebounds of seaweed, which has affected their environment and made life difficult for them by crippling business activities.Our correspondent, during an on-the-spot assessment of the seaweed-infested lagoon the community members complained bitterly about, observed that the environment was in deplorable condition.Some of the residents told our correspondent that they have been battling malaria since the seaweed took over the lagoon, aside from the losses they are incurring due to their inability to move on with their businesses.Fishermen say whenever the seaweed also known as water hyacinth takes over the lagoon, they are unable to go out to fish for fear of losing their nets to the plants.The residents expressed displeasure over the state government’s failure to clear the seaweed and ameliorate their plight, lamenting that this year was one of the worst hyacinth invasions recorded in the community.For the past two months, the residents said they have been battling malaria as their environment had become a breeding ground for mosquitoes due to the water hyacinth.According to experts, the invasion of water bodies by water hyacinths has been highlighted as a source of problems for riparian communities.Meanwhile, The National Inland Waters Authority said it has suspended all boat operations to the Ikorodu Ferry Terminal.The Lagos Area Manager of NIWA, Sarat Braimah, in a statement on Friday, said the development was due to strange rebounds of water hyacinth, which affected the Ikorodu water corridors.Recall that a commercial passenger boat, ‘Oyebola Marine’, on Thursday, caught fire at the loading point in Ikorodu Ferry Terminal. But all passengers onboard the boat were rescued alive.Speaking on the incident, Braimah maintained that she had ordered an immediate suspension of boat operations to and from the Ikorodu ferry terminal.She said the move was to avoid the breakdown of boat engines and avoidable boat mishaps by the water hyacinth in the area.Malaria out of controlResidents who spoke with our correspondent during the visit said that they suffer from malaria, cough and recurrent colds that have defied medical treatment.A resident and food seller, Mrs Tosin Taiwo, said, “We are already suffering a lot of sicknesses like malaria because of mosquito invasion. I am calling on the Lagos State Government to understand that Ikorodu is part of Lagos and that we are suffering; this seaweed needs to be taken away. Our sufferings need to be ameliorated.”Taiwo further said the seaweed had reduced commercial activities in the area, which she said had affected her business due to low patronage.A mother of three, Mrs Abigail Kolawole, said her three children were always on malaria medication since the invasion occurred.“One of them, who is nine years old, was unable to go to school for one week because she was down with malaria. This is what we experience every year and the state government is not doing anything about it.“A lot of the children that you see here are down with malaria. We want the government to help us. This year’s invasion is something else and it has affected our health and our income. People cannot go fishing anymore and the cost of living is high,” the trader lamented.Malaria public challenge in Lagos – AbayomiThe State’s Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, during an awareness walk to commemorate the year 2022 World Malaria Day in Lagos, said malaria remained a major public health challenge in the state and the disease remained the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the vulnerable group, especially children under the age of five and pregnant women.“We must ensure that we clean our environment properly via effective refuse disposal and management, covering of water storage containers, clearing of gutters, dredging of canals and channels among others, clearing of unkempt and dirty environments as these are breeding sites for mosquitoes,” he said.The latest World Malaria Report by the World Health Organisation shows that Africa bears a high percentage of the global malaria burden, with Nigeria having the highest burden in the world.In 2022, the African region was home to approximately 95 per cent of all malaria cases and 96 per cent of deaths, with children under the age of five accounting for 80 per cent of all malaria deaths, the report stated.The report shows that four African countries, including Nigeria, accounted for over half of all malaria deaths worldwide, saying that Nigeria alone accounted for 31.3 per cent of global malaria deaths, followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12.6 per cent), the United Republic of Tanzania (4.1 per cent), and Niger (3.9 per cent).In Nigeria, according to the report, malaria remains a significant public health challenge, with an estimated 97 million cases and 300,000 deaths annually.Seaweed breeds mosquitoesExperts say water hyacinths are known to reduce the velocity of water bodies, thereby serving as suitable breeding grounds for mosquitoes.“Their obstruction to water transportation also means students who cross invaded water bodies to school will have their education negatively affected”, the experts said.An environmental activist and founding partner, Dawn Project Initiative, Desmond Majekodunmi, told PUNCH Healthwise that the state government shouldn’t have allowed the water hyacinths to grow to the point of threatening human lives and taking boats hostage.He said the big problem was why the water hyacinth was not cleared when it was sighted initially.“The water hyacinth doesn’t happen overnight. It moves gradually until its impacts are felt in the environment. How did it get to the point that it is difficult to handle? Who was responsible for ensuring there is free movement of water and boats on the water?” he queried.Majekodunmi stated that water hyacinth damaged the paddle of small boats and made paddling a canoe difficult.“It’s all damaging. Whoever is responsible for that should be queried because it didn’t start one day or happened overnight, it’s been a long time since it started building up”, he said.He noted that suspending the terminal without clearing the hyacinth would not solve the problem, saying that the government knew what to do to clear them.A fisherman, Johnson Oke, said since the seaweed took over the water, he and his colleagues had stopped going out to fish.Oke said when the nets are let down, the fishes that are supposed to be caught will not be able to enter the nets as the seaweed and planks get stuck in the nets.“When the seaweed season is around, we hardly go out fishing. We don’t usually catch any fish when we let down our nets. The seaweed gets entangled in the nets as well as the planks underneath them.“We normally return home with torn nets as we struggle to free the nets from the elements. This is our trying time; this is when we need the government”, he lamented.Water transportation suspendedOther residents who spoke with PUNCH Healthwise shared their frustrations of having to travel by road amid the hike in fuel prices, following the temporary suspension of ferry services at Ipakodo Ferry Terminal due to the seaweed.Mr Charles Balogun, who works at the Apapa Wharf, said he now spends more money going to work than when he used to travel by water.Balogun, an Ikorodu landlord, who also complained of recurring malaria after treatment, said the closure of the terminal made going to work stressful for him.He said apart from wasting hours on the road, he spent more money on commercial motorcycles (Okada) and buses and got to his office tired.Related NewsGovernorship Election Live Updates‘Poor sanitation, hygiene major malaria control setbacks’Poverty, biggest driver of malaria prevalence –ExpertsReps move against fake anti-malaria drugs“I resorted to going to work by road pending the time Ipakodo becomes operational. I know there is an alternative jetty at Majidun, but it will be unwise for me to use such a developing jetty while the water hyacinth still poses a great threat to the boats and travelers.“I live close to Ipakodo Ferry and going from Ikorodu to Apapa by water is faster than going by road. Though some may say that the N2,000 we pay to and fro fee is expensive, I think it saves me a lot of stress and time.“With the ferry, I get to Apapa between 25 and 30 minutes without stress. The stress on the bus is too much and seeing area boys misbehave, breaks my heart. So, I prefer water transportation and it is easier, cheaper and more convenient for me to transport goods via water.“It takes me only N3, 500 to ferry to and fro Ikorodu and Apapa and back to my house. My house is a stone-throw from the Ipakodo terminal, so I don’t have to pay any other money to get it done.“But for me to board a bus, I will first take an Okada of N300 to Ogolonto before I will get a bus to Ketu (N300). Then, from Ketu to Mile 2 (N800) and Mile 2 to Apapa, I will take another Okada N500 despite the stress. The total is N1,900 to and N1,900 back.“On the average, you are spending N3,800, a difference of N300. This amount applies during off-peak hours because, during peak hours, you will pay higher than the amount I said, but that of the ferry is fixed; whether during peak or off-peak hours.“Apart from the increased expenditure, I have to board four different vehicles, whereas one boat takes me to my destination. Even if the price of a ferry is higher, I would still prefer it to save myself some stress. I try to avoid any avoidable stress.“I just hope that the authorities in charge will clean up the water hyacinth and return us to Ikorodu terminal. This water hyacinth is very unusual because the government didn’t start on time to clean it when it started building up.“On several occasions, I have witnessed what it does to the boats and their engines. The suspension was good, but let the government do something to end this permanently. People would have died last week due to this water hyacinth,” Balogun said.Extra to use alternative jettyAnother resident lamenting the suspension of the ferry services is Mrs. Bridget Egbokhare, who sells chemicals at the Wharf.The mother of two said she had to pay extra to transport herself to Majidun jetty, where she boards a boat.“At this time, when the prices of goods and services are going up, we are paying extra on transportation. And after paying the extra, I hope to recover it because nobody wants to incur extra costs these days,” she said.According to her, since the Majidun jetty is far away from her house, she has to board a motorcycle for N400 to the jetty if she is going alone or pay N300 if she were to share one Okada with another passenger.“It’s a lot easier for me to walk to the Ipakodo Terminal than Majidun. If I add the extra that I will pay to get the alternative jetty, I would be spending N800 extra.“If you add the N800 to N3,500, it will amount to N4,300 per day. If I calculate it from Monday when it was suspended till Saturday, I would have spent N25,800 on transportation alone.“If I pay this amount weekly, how much will I make? The hardship is everywhere. No matter how small you think the government’s decision is, it affects you in many ways.“If the government had done what it was supposed to do when it was supposed to do it, we wouldn’t get to this point of suspending ferry services and transferring the burden on the travellers.“The whole place looks like a bush, yet the government collects money from the operators for using the waterways. It’s sad that the government cannot clear ordinary water hyacinths. Up till now, the government doesn’t know what to do with the situation,” she lamented.We are facing low patronageA 31-year-old food vendor beside the perimeter fencing of the Terminal, Mrs. Vanessa Igolo, was seen virtually begging for customers’ patronage at about 2:41pm when she was supposed to be packing her things on a normal day.“Delicious rice and stew is available. Order your own,” she sang with a cheerful smile, eagerly looking from one passerby to another, hopeful for last-minute patronage.She said the low patronage was due to the suspension of the activities, which has diverted traffic to Majidun jetty and was ready to deliver the food to any location as long as there were sales.Also, her neigbhour, who sells beans with roasted plantain and yam, Josephine Isakor, followed the same part with the food vendor.She said, “My plantain doesn’t stay long on the tray because people buy them even before they are done. But you can see my tray with already done plantain and yam and nobody is pricing them.“This place used to be filled with people including Okada riders. In fact, people used to queue to carry passengers. We don’t know how long this will last, but we hope it doesn’t last till December because our own season has started.”“I’m going inside the complex to call them out for food. I can also package it and send it to them in their offices to make sure I completely sell food,” she said.Experts blame the governmentContinuing, Majekodunmi called on the government to address the problem.He said, “There are special boats designed for this. It can only take one or two of them to clean up the water hyacinth.“But I am afraid that the government will now require quite a number of them to clean up the water hyacinth because it had allowed it to multiply uncontrollably. But the point that I’m making is that it is cleanable. So whoever is responsible should move into action.”Breeding sites for disease-carrying mosquitoesSpeaking on the environmental impact of the water hyacinth, Majekodunmi, who is also the Chairman of the Lekki State Urban Forest and Animal Shelter Initiative, said the water hyacinth was damaging to the environment and provided a favourable habitat for breeding mosquitoes.He said, “Water hyacinth has some pool of water in its leaves and therefore creates a great habitat for disease-carrying mosquitoes to thrive. They lay their eggs in the water and hatch them into larvae.“These larvae later grow into adult mosquitoes, especially anopheles mosquitoes and begin to spread malaria by feeding on human blood and depositing the parasite into humans. And these are part of the environmental factors that make malaria endemic in Nigeria and Africa.”A Public Health Physician at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba, Lagos, Dr. Azeezat Shopeyin-Dosunmu, said malaria is endemic in many tropical countries, including sub-Saharan Africa, where Nigeria is located.She said due to various environmental factors including temperature, high humidity, stagnant waters and rainfall, which are favourable to the survival of the anopheles mosquito and plasmodium parasite, malaria will continue to thrive in Nigeria.She added that these environmental factors make it difficult to eliminate malaria in Nigeria.“Clean environment and good environmental sanitation will help. We need to get rid of any stagnant water, ensure that we don’t store up water in the containers around our house and ensure that the drainage systems are well treated and covered,” she added.When contacted, the Director of Public Affairs, Lagos State Ministry of Environment and Water Resources, Kunle Adeshina, said the clearing of Water Hyacinth at the Ikorodu Terminal was not under the purview of the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources, but the Ministry of Waterfront Infrastructure Development.On the environment and mosquito infestation caused by the water hyacinth, which has also resulted in malaria transmissions in the community, he said people cannot live in a flood plain, where they are not authorised to live and begin to call on the government when something went wrong.“Of course, there will be malaria due to mosquito bites. But they have gone to live in the habitat of water and the water will take its course. I don’t know what to say about this because when they live in a water-logged environment, there will be mosquitoes there. Of course, we are not saying anybody should die of malaria,” he said.“However, water hyacinth in an environment like that will also result in mosquito infestation and that is still because they are living in a flood plain. We are aware of some Ibeshe areas that are affected, especially when water is released from the Osun dam. But when you tell them to leave, the constant argument will be, where will they go?” he added.Also, when contacted, the Director of Public Affairs at the Ministry of Waterfront Infrastructure Development, Mrs. Dupe Ileyemi said she was on leave and did not “have anybody’s contact” to give to our correspondent. Residentsof Ikorodu community in the Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State have lamented the impact of strange rebounds of seaweed, which has affected their environment and made life difficult for them by crippling business activities.Our correspondent, during an on-the-spot assessment of the seaweed-infested lagoon the community members complained bitterly about, observed that the environment was in deplorable condition.Some of the residents told our correspondent that they have been battling malaria since the seaweed took over the lagoon, aside from the losses they are incurring due to their inability to move on with their businesses.Fishermen say whenever the seaweed also known as water hyacinth takes over the lagoon, they are unable to go out to fish for fear of losing their nets to the plants.The residents expressed displeasure over the state government’s failure to clear the seaweed and ameliorate their plight, lamenting that this year was one of the worst hyacinth invasions recorded in the community.For the past two months, the residents said they have been battling malaria as their environment had become a breeding ground for mosquitoes due to the water hyacinth.According to experts, the invasion of water bodies by water hyacinths has been highlighted as a source of problems for riparian communities.Meanwhile, The National Inland Waters Authority said it has suspended all boat operations to the Ikorodu Ferry Terminal.The Lagos Area Manager of NIWA, Sarat Braimah, in a statement on Friday, said the development was due to strange rebounds of water hyacinth, which affected the Ikorodu water corridors.Recall that a commercial passenger boat, ‘Oyebola Marine’, on Thursday, caught fire at the loading point in Ikorodu Ferry Terminal.

Cairo, Egypt– Spiro Spathis, Egypt’s oldest carbonated drinks company, is having a sensational comeback. Founded in 1920 by a Greek beekeeper from Kefalonia whose name it bears, “Spathis” has been part of life for generations of Egyptians. Now, thanks to a nationwide campaign to boycott Western producers supportive of Israel, the century-old brand is causing a stir as the poster child for Egyptian solidarity with Palestinians. Spiro Spathis, which has always been proud of its role as Egypt’s first soft drink brand, is rolling out slogans like “100% Made in Egypt” and “Egypt’s original gazouza”, using an Egyptian term thought to derive from the French “gazeuse” (carbonated) and widely used to refer to fizzy drinks. “I’ve been selling their drinks for four years. There were always a few consumers who preferred Spiro over other drinks, but not many,” Mohammed, who owns a grocery store in Sharqia governorate, said. “But now, their bottles run out almost instantly. Before the boycott, I would sell four, maybe five, boxes of Spathis in a week, now I can sell as many as 50 boxes in a day if I have that many in stock,” he continued, adding that the surge in demand is “massive”. “Demand has tripled over the past month,” Morcus Talaat, the company’s head of marketing and one of three siblings who own the firm, told Al Jazeera. Talaat spoke to Al Jazeera between back-to-back meetings at the no-frills, two-bedroom, ground-floor apartment in an upscale Cairo neighbourhood where Sprio Spathis has its headquarters. “We’ve received hundreds of calls from new clients… offers from restaurants.” Spiro Spathis has gone on a recruitment drive and received more than 15,000 applicants for jobs it advertised to try to meet the demand. In Cairo’s neighbourhood of Nasr City, a kiosk owner says he has not been able to source enough Spathis to meet the demand. “I’ve only had four deliveries in the past month, and it gets sold out on the same day. Previously, Spathis’ stocks lasted longer.” Israel’s relentless bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza, which began on October 7 and has so far killed more than 11,500 Palestinians, has prompted mass protests around the world. It has also caused many toboycott international brands like McDonald’sand Starbucks. In Indonesia, consumers began boycotting Mcdonald’s and other businesses in mid-October after McDonald’s Israel announced on social media that it had handed out thousands of free meals to the Israeli military during its war on Gaza. The announcement prompted several organisations, including the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement (BDS), the United People Front (FUB) and the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), to call for a boycott of McDonald’s and other businesses perceived to be pro-Israel, including Burger King. As protesters flood the streets of major cities around the globe, from Washington, DC, to London and Cape Town, branches of franchise restaurants, coffee shops and stores that were once bustling in the Arab World are largely empty. “Boycotting is a form of popular tool for people to make themselves heard, and is the most powerful means to pressure Western colonialism and capitalism-fuelled states,” said Jamal Zahran, political science professor at the University of Suez. “Boycotting these products also creates opportunities for local products.” Since the start of the war, Egyptians have been using social media to exchange information about which brands are considered supportive of Israel and should be avoided. Some apps are also listing alternatives to Western brands, highlighting local producers of equal or similar quality. “Is it with us, or not?” is a question frequently asked on Meta posts about various brands, as people research which to give up. The result has been the rediscovery of local substitutes like Spiro Spathis, which was once the only soda drinks manufacturer in the Arab world’s most populous country. But, as other international brands entered the market about 70 years ago, then flooded the local market, it was sidelined. Spiro Spathis even shut its doors altogether in 2014, Talaat said. “We’re the second generation of Egyptians to own the firm. Our father bought the company in 1998 and ran it up until he passed away in 2009. In 2014, we closed down Spiro Spathis, before returning again in 2019, and have been present in the market every single day since,” he added. Although it is not the only local soda drinks company in Egypt, Spathis is being lauded by many online users in Egypt as the best. Trending on social media, the company’s history and logo have gained attention and stirred the curiosity of younger generations not familiar with the brand. “Why is there a fly in its logo?” some asked on social media. According to Talaat, the century-old logo is, in fact, a bee, not a fly, marking the founder’s original profession as a beekeeper on the Greek island of Kefalonia. Social media users also joked about the difficulty of finding a Spathis soda because of the increased demand and limited supply. “I’m trying to find myself, and Spiro Spathis,” quipped one Meta user. “We’re working around the clock to meet the surge in demand,” said Talaat. “Since October 7, we’ve been executing a year’s plans of expansions, growth and distribution in a period of a month to meet the market’s needs.” Besides expanding geographically, increasing production of its eight flavours and hiring teams to address consumer feedback and manage distributors’ orders, Talaat also said the company is planning to add a new cola flavour that customers asked for to replace the colas being boycotted in Egypt. Since the war, Egyptian social media users have noted offers and discounts for Western-made products they have turned their backs on. Many have also engaged in online debates about the efficiency of such boycotts which some see as harming the livelihoods of Egyptian workers employed by franchises. Sahar Azazi, 31, who lives in Cairo, said boycotting brands is the most obvious action to take. “It’s the least we can do to support Palestinians under attack, and it is not a temporary action on my part. I won’t be eating or drinking something that has made the murder of an innocent Palestinian possible,” she said, adding that Spiro Spathis as a local product is just as good as the drinks she’s given up. “They’re not as available, though, since the boycott began,” she noted. For Talaat, Spiro Spathis is very much back in business. “We plan to be there for Egyptian consumers always, even if the boycott doesn’t last. We’re here to stay,” he said.

Residents in eastern Bulgaria, which was hit the hardest, said they had never before experienced such extreme weather. A state of emergency was declared in the Black Sea city of Varna, which received torrential rain mixed with snow along with intense wind. Officials said the conditions posed risks to the population. The mayor’s office reported power disruptions in all boroughs of Varna. Fallen trees and branches blocked key roads, leaving vehicles stranded. The city called on residents to stay home and not to use their cars unless they had urgent needs. Varna International Airport was open but had delayed and canceled flights, airport officials said. Police reported that a man died Saturday after his van hit a fallen tree on a major boulevard in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. In Varna, a woman died instantly after being struck by a falling tree branch. Bulgarian meteorologists issued warnings for dangerous weather for most of the country's east on Sunday, forecasting winds gusting up to 125 kph (78 mph). The heavy rain was expected to turn into snow as temperatures fell. Across the Black Sea, the severe weather also caused widespread damage and disruption inTurkey, including the splitting of a cargo ship and the evacuation of a prison. The Maritime General Directorate said the Cameroon-flagged Pallada “broke into two due to heavy weather conditions” after running aground amid 5-meter (15-foot) waves off Eregli, a coastal town 200 kilometers (124 miles) east of Istanbul. All 13 crew members were rescued safely. The weather hampered efforts to reach another cargo vessel, the Turkish-flagged Kafkametler, as the ship drifted close to a breakwater outside the town’s harbor. Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said prisoners were moved from Eregli’s prison to surrounding facilities due to rising water levels. Turkey’s emergency agency, AFAD, earlier issued severe weather warnings for 72 of the country’s 81 provinces. Turkish Airlines canceled 105 scheduled flights from Istanbul’s two airports on Sunday. Snow led to travel disruptions on the Istanbul-Ankara highway. The private Demiroren news agency reported fallen trees, lamp posts and phone poles in Zonguldak and Sakarya provinces, as well as damage to buildings. Istanbul Governor Davut Gul said 210 homes and workplaces were flooded in the Black Sea town of Sile. Wind speeds had reached up to 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph), he reported. On the Marmara Sea, fishing boats moored at Esenkoy were destroyed and heavy rain led to landslides.","['not found', 'bulgaria', 'bulgaria', 'bulgaria', 'bulgaria', 'bulgaria', 'bulgaria', 'turkey', 'turkey', 'turkey', 'turkey', 'turkey', 'turkey', 'chile']",us,False,False

Most of the island has already been lost to the sea, and what remains is routinely flooded at high tide. When 62-year-old fisherman Kpana Charlie has finished sorting through the day's catch and patching up the holes in his nets, he likes to settle into a weathered wooden chair on his front porch and let his mind drift back to his childhood. Back then, his home on Sierra Leone's Nyangai Island seemed like paradise. He spent endless hours playing with his friends on the island's dazzling white beaches or splashing about in the warm, green sea. He liked to kick around a soccer ball on the sports field in his village, and in mango season, he would shimmy up the trees to collect their bountiful fruit. Whenever he wanted to avoid having to do his homework, he could simply disappear into the dense forest that covered much of the island. Today, Nyangai is disappearing before his very eyes, swallowed up by the relentless sea. As recently as ten years ago, it still measured some 2,300 feet from end to end. What's left today is a patch of sand barely 300 feet long and 250 wide. The forests are gone, swamped by saltwater. The soccer field lies under water for 22 hours of the day. And the land on which Charlie's family home once stood, the home he was born in, has long since vanished beneath the waves. In as little as two years, Charlie fears, Nyangai may no longer exist at all. ""It's getting worse and worse,"" says Charlie, a father of six who has lived in a makeshift home of sticks and tarpaulin since his previous home was washed away. ""There's nowhere to go to the toilet. There's nowhere to be free. Whenever the water's high the place floods all over. It never used to happen like this.""

It never used to happen like this."" With nearly a third of its population living in coastal areas, and its heavy reliance on subsistence agriculture and fishing, Sierra Leone has been identifiedas one of the world'smost vulnerable countriesto the impacts of climate change, despite having contributed just a tiny fraction of global CO2 emissions. With a GDP per capita of barely $2,000, it is also one of the least prepared to deal with those impacts. With global sea levels projected to rise by anywhere between 1 and 3 feet by the end of the century, along with an increase in extreme weather events, the experience of this West African island offers a glimpse into the possible fate of countless other low-lying areas around the world. From his office in the capital, Freetown, Gabriel Kpaka, the head of operations for the country's Meteorological Agency, says the reason for Nyangai's troubles is clear. Kpana Charlie, 62, looks on as seawater floods onto Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone. In the span of his lifetime, Charlie has watched the island shrink to just a tiny fraction of its former size as it is swallowed up by the encroaching sea. He believes in as little as two years it may vanish beneath the waves altogether.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Kpana Charlie, 62, looks on as seawater floods onto Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone. He believes in as little as two years it may vanish beneath the waves altogether. ""We're seeing significant sea-level rise and these people don't have any proper defenses,"" he says. ""All they have is sandbags. If we don't act now the impacts on people are just going to get worse."" Nyangai is one of a cluster of islands that make up the Turtle Islands archipelago. Low-lying and with loose, sandy soils, the islands have always been shaped by the sea. Their beaches shift slowly over time. Sand is eroded from one headland and deposited on the next. But the scale of the destruction of Nyangai, and the speed at which it's playing out, is like nothing the islanders have ever seen. Loading... The island's chief, Mustafa Kong, estimates that 20 years ago there were more than 500 homes on Nyangai, with an average of 8 people living in each. Now there are barely 70. Most people have left for the safety of neighboring islands or the mainland, joining theestimated 20 million peopleworldwide displaced by climate change and extreme weather events on average each year. There is little reliable data on sea level change in Sierra Leone. Until two years ago, the country did not even have a fully functional marine meteorological station that could measure it. But, a 2017 USAID climate vulnerability study found that parts of its coastline are already receding at a rate of 13-to-20 feet per year. From their vantage point on Nyangai, most of the islanders say it's hard to gauge how much the sea level itself is rising. What's more apparent, they say, is that the storms have become more severe and more frequent, the rainfall more violent and less predictable, and the winds stronger, driving ever more destructive waves that batter and erode their shrinking island.

The island is rapidly being washed away by the encroaching sea. When Charlies was growing up, the thought had never even crossed his mind that the island on which his family had lived for three generations could be at serious risk from the sea. But, by 2012, he'd started to become worried. He remembers vividly the first time he truly began to believe the island might become uninhabitable. It was a Friday night in August 2012, and the islanders woke up to the sound of a howling gale and waves crashing into the walls of their homes. By midnight, panic had taken over, as families rushed to save their possessions and store them in the comparative safety of their boats. By the time the storm eventually abated, 35 houses had been washed away. ""It was chaos,"" says Charlie. ""Everyone was so afraid. The next morning, we all decided to leave. I told myself I couldn't stay here any longer."" Many left the island soon after, but as calm gradually returned, Charlie changed his mind. He no longer felt safe on the island, but the prospect of setting up a new life elsewhere was no less daunting. Nyangai was his home. He liked that the island was free of snakes and, with no fresh water for mosquitoes to breed, virtually free of malaria. His family owned land there, and the surrounding waters provided his livelihood. Besides, moving would be hugely expensive. ""Now we're always prepared because we know we'll have to move,"" says Charlie. ""We just don't know when."" On a Friday in late September, Charlie stands by the shore in the shade of one of the few trees still standing, watching as the high tide breached the top of the beach and began flowing down through people's homes on the other side. The islanders scramble to make what rudimentary defenses they can. One woman builds a ridge of sand around the base of her house to try to channel the water elsewhere. Another grabs a tattered sheet of tarpaulin and wedges it beneath her front door. Most of Nyangai's population has already left, and those who have stayed know that their days on the island may be numbered.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Most of Nyangai's population has already left, and those who have stayed know that their days on the island may be numbered. By 8 a.m., at least a dozen houses have been flooded, yet again, and a knee-deep pool of muddy water has accumulated in the center of the island. Children run out to play in it. ""The kids love it when it floods,"" complains one bystander. ""They don't understand that that's what will destroy the island. The water is destroying us, one house at a time."" As the tide continues to rise, shopkeeper Tene Kamara races to pack up her inventory — soap, toothpaste, sandals and other basic goods imported from the mainland — and store them on tabletops above the reach of the water. Kamara spent 15 years building up her business on Nyangai after moving to the island from Freetown. She used to do a brisk trade, she says, but with the population shrinking by the month, she's finding it ever harder to turn a profit. ""I'd go tomorrow if I could,"" she says. Shopkeeper Tene Kamara, 48, photographed in her shop on Nyangai island, Sierra Leone. Kamara has been building her business here for the past 15 years, but most of her customers have now fled the island as the sea erodes it away. ""I'd leave tomorrow if I could,"" said Kamara. ""I'm afraid, and it makes my heart worry.""Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Shopkeeper Tene Kamara, 48, photographed in her shop on Nyangai island, Sierra Leone. ""I'm afraid, and it makes my heart worry."" Some of the other islands of the Turtle Islands archipelago are also experiencing increasing rates of erosion but not on the scale seen on Nyangai. Some are ringed by protective mangrove forests whose tangle of roots and branches act as a barrier to the waves and help to trap sediment. Others rise higher above sea level or have denser, less sandy soil. All are now home to growing numbers of people displaced from Nyangai. ""I loved Nyangai so much,"" says Karim Anso, a 43-year-old former resident of the island who last year made the move to nearby Sei Island. ""The fishing was good. We had good friends. But the water became a problem. The sea took everything."" Karim Anso, a 43-year-old refugee from Nyangai Island, photogaphed outside his new home on nearby Sei Island. Anso's family had to rebuild their home four times, fleeing ever further inland as the sea encroached onto Nyangai Island. Eventually, with the island continuing to shrink, he relocated at significant cost.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Karim Anso, a 43-year-old refugee from Nyangai Island, photogaphed outside his new home on nearby Sei Island. Eventually, with the island continuing to shrink, he relocated at significant cost. Each time the water destroyed his house, Anso says, he would build another one farther inland. By the time his fourth home had been washed away, he decided he had no option but to leave with his wife and four children. ""I did it for my children,"" he said, sitting in a hammock outside his new home on Sei. For the roughly 400 people who remain, the constant erosion has prevented any kind of stability. At one point there were three separate villages on different parts of the island. By 2012, however, the land had been reduced to a thin strip, and the villages merged into a single settlement stretching along its length. Then, in 2015, the sea began to eat away the strip's middle, eventually separating the people on one end from those on the other. One island had become two. At low tide, children from one side would have to wade through water to get to school on the other. At high tide they'd have to take a boat. Friends and families were divided. Kpana Charlie was appointed as a new chief to run Mokontan, the name given to one of the two outposts, while Chief Kong ran the other one, known as Mobiaboi. Storm clouds gather over the site where Mobiaboi Town once stood before it was lost to the sea in 2022, in Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone. All that remains of that settlement is a sand bar that emerges at low tide, dotted with the stumps of coconut palms that were once part of a dense forest. As little as five years ago, the settlement was home to hundreds of people.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Storm clouds gather over the site where Mobiaboi Town once stood before it was lost to the sea in 2022, in Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone. As little as five years ago, the settlement was home to hundreds of people. But no sooner had the islanders grown accustomed to this new state of affairs than Mobiaboi was overtaken by the waves. As recently as 2018 it had been a bustling village of more than a hundred homes, but by the end of 2022, the last family had packed up and left. Today all that remains of the place are the stumps of dead coconut palms embedded in a forlorn mound of sand that emerges at low tide. Nyangai is one island again, and the whole population is now crammed into what's left of Mokontan, with Mustafa Kong back in charge. Kong has an unenviable role. He is responsible for the well-being of his people but is utterly powerless to arrest the advance of the water. At one stage he organized the planting of a small mangrove forest in an attempt to shore up one side of the island, but the seedlings didn't last long. Goats devoured most of them. Storms uprooted the rest. Kong has appealed to the government to build a levee around the island, but this has not happened. Mustafa Kong salvages building materials from the wreckage of his house, destroyed by flooding two weeks earlier, on Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone. ""God will decide what happens to us"" said Kong, who has seen the vast majority of his island disappear into the ocean in the span of his lifetime.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Mustafa Kong salvages building materials from the wreckage of his house, destroyed by flooding two weeks earlier, on Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone.

""There's nothing else I can do for them,"" he said, sitting on a chair in front of a friend's home, where he's been living since his own house was destroyed by flooding two weeks earlier. ""We used to have so much. Now everything's gone."" In the nearest large town, the former British trading post of Bonthe, where colonial ruins still dot the coast, the local government has responded to the sharp increase in flooding by constructing a concrete seawall along the length of the town. But in the many smaller coastal towns and villages in the area, there simply aren't the resources. A USAID initiative attempted to help protect some of the area's most vulnerable settlements by planting mangroves, but this has had limited success. With insufficient funds for their upkeep, and with the population relying on mangrove wood for building and smoking fish, few trees outlived the project, which concluded in 2021. When theenvironmental news outlet Mongabayvisited one of the project sites in 2022, it found that, out of 1,000 mangrove trees planted, barely 60 were still alive. The national government, meanwhile, struggles to maintain key infrastructure and provide basic services even in the capital, let alone undertake costly engineering projects on a remote island now home to just a few hundred people. ""Nyangai is not a government priority at the moment,"" acknowledges Paul Lamin, the deputy director of the country's Environmental Protection Agency.""We have so many competing priorities in Sierra Leone and only scarce resources."" Lamin says the government has been implementing mangrove restoration projects in some communities, as well as raising awareness of the risks of deforestation, but that no other sea defenses are currently planned. ""Vulnerable countries should be getting some support [from wealthy nations] to strengthen their climate resilience,"" says Lamin. ""But we're not really seeing that.""

On Nyangai, Chief Kong's long-held dream had been to build himself a home of bricks or concrete, a home fit for a chief that would be a source of pride and prestige not only for him, personally, but for the island as a whole. But over the years, the dream has died. The typical Turtle Islands home has walls of intricately woven sticks overlaid with palm fronds or a mud coating, with a roof of dense thatch. But for his last two homes, Kong has simply used fabric from old sacks stretched over a frame of sticks, using rusting sheets of corrugated iron for a roof. Doing any more, he feels, would be a waste of time. Most of Nyangai's houses are now built in a similar fashion, giving the place the transitory feel of a refugee camp. ""My heart is broken,"" said Kong, who rarely leaves his house these days. ""I just sit inside, thinking about it. It makes me so sad."" For those who remain on Nyangai, life is becoming increasingly tough. The island's well has been flooded with sea-water, forcing islanders to travel 45 minutes each way by boat to collect drinking water from neighboring islands during the long months of the dry season. There's no longer anywhere private for them to relieve themselves, so the islanders simply hide behind bushes on the shore, timing their toilet trips so that the beach can be washed clean by the incoming tide. Without space to play soccer or forests to play in, children mill around looking bored or devise games among the stumps of the uprooted trees that ring much of the island. No one is certain what will happen next. Charlie's predicted two-year timeline for the island's future may be on the short side. Others hope that at least a part of it will hold out for several more years or perhaps even longer. Dead and dying trees, the remnants of what were once extensive forests, dot the fast receding shoreline of Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Dead and dying trees, the remnants of what were once extensive forests, dot the fast receding shoreline of Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone. But the island's long-term prospects look bleak. Among the islanders still there, a sense of fatalism now prevails. They know they lack the means to stop the continuing destruction of their island. They also know there is scant prospect of receiving much help from outside. Instead, many say they have put their faith in a higher power.

They're accustomed to using their four semi-trucks to take the harvest from a total of about 800 acres each of corn, soybeans and wheat to market. What they're not used to are the distances they've had to drive the past couple years, a consequence of bad weather that's only expected to increase in their area as a result of climate change. They used to take advantage of a grain elevator in Mayfield, Kentucky — a massive facility that bought and stored millions of bushels of grain from farmers. But it was destroyed in the 2021 tornado outbreak that killed dozens of people and leveled entire parts of the town, and the company that ran it shut down. Now, instead of driving ten minutes, they sometimes travel an hour or more. “The swings in the weather events that we have ... that’s kind of scary,” he said, especially for those with smaller farms. “If you’ve got a larger farm operation, your acreage is spread out over a larger area, so the risks are probably minimized more because they’re spread out more.” Farmers and experts echo Ralph and say that larger farms have more ways to manage risk, but smaller to midsize farmers struggle when extreme weather hits. Human-caused climate change is only anticipated to amplify the number and intensity of those extreme events, from flash droughts to increased rainfall. And as the planet warms, scientists say the country will see more tornado- and hail-spawning storms and that those deadly events will strike more frequently in populous mid-Southern states a big issue for everyone living in those areas and especially for those trying to hold onto small family farms. That's already a reality for the area around Mayfield, which is in a flat coastal plain region in the western part of the state and which has been hit by extreme weather in more ways than one. In addition to the 2021 tornado outbreak, this summer they were hit by flooding that surpassed 10 inches in some areas, submerging crops. Keith Lowry, another farmer near Mayfield, woke up one morning this summer to eight inches of rain, and by dinner time, when the deluge finally stopped, knew he had a problem. Lowry found fields of half-submerged corn, soybeans that had disappeared under the flooding almost entirely and rapids rushing from their spillway like a waterfall. Now, at harvest time, he estimates that they lost between five and 10% of their crop this year. What’s more, they had to deal with the debris that had washed into their fields, a nuisance that gets in the way of heavy machinery. Lowry has a relatively big operation — 3,000 acres, mostly in corn and soybeans, along with another 2,000 acres his son farms. Although he took some losses, he says that he and other farmers are used to dealing with uncooperative weather. “That’s the nature of the beast,” he said. But without the grain elevator or on-farm storage and with limitedtransportationoptions, Lowry explained that his neighbors would have been stuck with soybeans in their fields. That's why a cloudy day this November found him helping out on a much smaller parcel of land, to bring in a harvest from about 250 acres. While farmers and town residents have leaned on each other to be resilient, the compounding effect of those natural disasters has had lasting impacts on a community where agriculture is at the heart of commerce. “Because we have such a big county that’s really heavily populated with grain farmers, the loss of (the grain elevator) has forced them to move to surrounding counties, oftentimes 40 or 50 miles away to transport their grain,” said Miranda Rudolph, the University of Kentucky's cooperative extension agent for Graves County. She said that fuel costs have risen, adding to the strain. Hans Schmitz, a conservation agronomist with Purdue's extension agency, said that large farms tend to have a wider range of options to balance out their risk, including crop insurance, which often costs less per acre when applied to larger areas. Jed Clark, for example, who farms about 3,000 acres of grain near Mayfield, said that he relies on crop insurance and also tries to spread out his crop rotations strategically, betting that crops in a low-lying area will do well in a dry year and that crops on higher ground will outlast the ones that are washed out when it floods. On smaller farms, if farmers are forced to put everything in a low-lying area that floods, an entire crop can be affected, Schmitz said. Farmers with less land therefore sometimes look toward specialty crops like watermelon or tomato to try to increase profits with the acreage they have, but those crops are not as easily insured. Schmitz said he thinks that climate change is contributing to the consolidation of farmland — that is, large farms getting larger. It’s relatively easy for a very small farm to get started, but harder to stay afloat. “What concerns me is the hollowing out of the middle,” he said. The capability of a smaller farm to survive also has to do with infrastructure, said Adam Kough, another Kentucky farmer who has a mostly family-run 1200 acres of corn, soybeans and wheat (as well as two swine barns and 100 sheep) between Mayfield and Murray. He thinks the farmers who were hurt the most after the tornado were those who didn't have grain storage on their land. Kough said he has noticed changes in the weather over the years, but he thinks a corporate mentality has more to do with why big farms will always get bigger. “People have changed more than the weather has,” he said. “The morals have changed in the last 20 years ... I call it cutthroat."" Still, the weather impacts are undeniable. Schmitz, who also farms about 1200 acres of corn, soybeans and wheat in Indiana, says that he's seen increasing summertime humidity foster diseases of wheat, barley and oats in the Midwest. He's seen higher nighttime temperatures induce more heat stress on most crops. And he said that while some farmers turn to irrigation to get them through sudden and intense droughts — he's seen those same irrigation pivots end up in standing water after intense and sudden floods. “It goes back to the old saying that in the Midwest, ‘if you don’t like the weather, wait 5 minutes.' We certainly always have had the capacity for pretty significant changes in weather over a short period of time,” he said. “But to see climate change exacerbating those potential extremes both ways within a short period of time is disconcerting.” ___ Associated Press journalist Joshua Bickel contributed to this report. ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Melina Walling on X, formerly known as Twitter: @MelinaWalling. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Ustrell is one of scores of European winemakers struggling to grow enough grapes asextreme and unseasonable weatherbecomes more commonplace. High input costs and declining consumption are adding to the woes of small, independent wineries. According to the International Organisation for Vine and Wine (OIV), an industry group, global wine production isset to fallto its lowest level since 1961 this year, hit by soaring temperatures and extraordinary flooding. Fueling that decline are expected drops of 12% and 14% in output in Italy and Spain, the world’s biggest and third-biggest producers in 2022, respectively. Climate change is having a “tremendous” impact on wine production, Giogio Delgrosso, head ﻿of statistics at the OIV, told CNN. Delgrosso said that, in the past, extreme weather would strike every few years to interrupt long stretches of healthy, abundant harvests. “Now extreme climate events are always happening. Every year there’s something.” This year, heavy rainfall has helped mold spread through vineyards in central and southern Italy, while a severe drought and soaring temperatures have blighted vineyards in Spain. Other major wine producers, including Australia, South Africa and Chile, are expected to suffer drops of between 10% and 24% in output this year, according to OIV data, as floods, wildfires, droughts, and fungal disease have hammered vineyards. The changing climate is helping others, however. Output in the United States, the world’s fourth-largest producer, is forecast to grow 12% this year. Greg Jones, a climatologist and chief executive of Abacela, an Oregon-based winery, told CNN that, half a century ago, the state couldn’t grow grapes. Now, he said, rising temperatures have made Oregon “one of the top producing regions in the country.” Ust﻿rell in Spain has come to live with the unpredictable weather. For about two years now, it has hardly rained in Gratallops, which lies about 90 miles west of Barcelona. That has put serious stress on Ustrell’s vines. And snow, which seeps into the deepest layers of the soil, providing moisture for the vines during the dry summer months, hasn’t fallen once in that time. It’s little surprise, then, that Ustrell’s harvest of Cabernet Sauvignon — a variety of red wine grapes traditionally grown in France’s Bordeaux region, where conditions are more humid — was the first to, as he put it, “collapse” this year. Vineyards in Gratallops are so parched, he added, that 26 of its 28 wineries, including Celler Devinssi, have recently formed an association to lobby local authorities for funding to improve the water supply for irrigation, even if that means delivering huge vats of water into the town via truck. Celler Devinssi is not at risk of closure, but the 23-year-old firm’s bank account will almost certainly “be in the red” this year, according to Ustrell. Across the border, French winemakers are grappling with the opposite problem: Too much wine﻿. France is on track to pip Italy to become the world’s biggest producer this year, according to OIV data, up from second place in 2022. The country maintained the same level of production as last year thanks to more favorable weather. But the burgeoning supply of wine has exceeded waning demand in France and abroad, pushing down prices. The mismatch prompted French and European Union authorities toannouncea joint €200 million ($217 million) buyback scheme this summer, allowing French winemakers to sell their excess stock to distilleries for recycling into other alcoholic products like hand sanitizer. Falling prices have coincided with rising input costs. Over the past two years, a mix of soaring inflation and historically highenergy priceshas jacked up the cost of inputs like fertilizer, bottles and transportation fuel. Add to that higher interest rates, which have made borrowing to invest much costlier, and many winemakers’ already-narrow profit margins have all but disappeared. French winemakers struggling to sell their own produce have taken out their anger on imports from Spain. Hundreds of them descended on a major cross-border highway last month and stormed trucks transporting Spanish wine into France. The protestors smashed crates and emptied gallons of imported wine onto the road. Frédéric Rouanet, who organized the demonstration, explained to CNN that Spain makes many lower-priced wines and said the message to merchants was clear: “If you want to get cheap wine from Spain, you’ll have to buy our wine from us first.” Otherwise, said Rouanet, who runs an association of winemakers in Aude in France, the region’swineries simply “can’t get by.” Meanwhile, people around the world are drinking less wine than in previous years, opting for beer or spir﻿its instead, or ditching alcohol altogether. Globally, wine consumption has fallen about 6% between 2017 and 2022, OIV data shows, as consumers have changed their drinking habits andinflation has erodedtheir disposable income. That means nearly 1.9 billionfewer wine bottles were drunk last year than in 2017. Estimates for this year,citedby the European Commission in June, show even steeper declines across European countries, suggesting the trend may be accelerating. The multiplepressures have forced some vineyards to close their doors. Michael Baynes, co-founder of Vineyards-Bordeaux Christie’s International Real Estate, an investment advisory specializing in vineyards, said the number of winemakers selling up, while still a tiny fraction of all Bordeaux producers, had “dramatically increased” this year. “It’s a bloodbath,” he told CNN. “We’re seeing some very sad stories at the moment. A lot of multigeneration families are losing estates that they’ve nurtured for many years.” Their problems started 20 years ago, Baynes said, when Bordeaux’s lower-priced wines were forced into competition with “New World” wines — such as those from Chile, Argentina and Australia — that were rising in popularity. Surviving family-run wineries, and larger wineries selling into the lower end of the market, are in a precarious position, Baynes said. A bad harvest, a newexport tariff, anotherinterest rate hikecan be all it takes for a generations-old winery to shut for good. And “jittery and nervous” lenders aren’t coming to the rescue of wineries they suspect would struggle to repay expensiveloans, he added. “They are turning off the tap of lending.” “The families, the generations, the blood, sweat and toil that has gone into creating a lovely product may be lost forever.” Climate change was the reason John Mitra sold the Bordeaux vineyard he owned with his wife, Penelope, last year as it made predicting each year’s harvest too difficult. “It’s just too risky,” he told CNN. “Some years you would get 3,000 bottles off a hectare. Other years, you’d end up with 50. Unless you have substantial financial backing behind you, you can’t operate.” The couple have since moved 340 miles east to establish The Burgundy Wine Company, a merchant specializing in wines produced by small, independent vineyards. They chose the Burgundy region because it is very small, and so the wine produced there — less available, more coveted — fetches higher prices than wine ﻿from many other places. More and more of Mitra’s suppliers and friends in the industry are deciding to sell their vineyards, or taking advantage of a French government subsidy to uproot their vines and replant the land with new crops, or to simply turn it over to woodland. Some have replaced their vines with olive trees and kiwi plants, he said, because they are more resistant to drought. Mitra misses his previous occupation. For 12 months, through “rain or freezing cold,” he and his wife would tend to their vines. The two or three days spent harvesting the grapes each year made it all worthwhile, he said. Still, Mitra is happy to have chartered a new path in an industry he adores, and feels lucky to still be living among France’s fabled vineyards. “Now I just walk my dog in the vines, rather than own them.”","['spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'spain', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy', 'australia', 'australia', 'southafrica', 'chile', 'chile', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'france', 'argentina']",us,True,False

From October 2022 to March 2023, the state was blasted by 31 atmospheric rivers—colossal bands of water vapor that form above the Pacific and become firehoses when they reach the West Coast. What surprised climate scientists wasn’t the number of storms, but their strength and rat-a-tat frequency. The downpours shocked a water system that had just experienced the driest three years in recorded state history, causing floods, mass evacuations, and at least 22 deaths. Swinging betweenwet and dry extremesis typical for California, but last winter’s rain, potentially intensified by climate change, was almost unmanageable. Add to that the arrival of El Niño, and more extreme weather looks likely for the state. This is going to make life very difficult for the dam operators tasked with capturing and controlling much of the state’s water. Like most of the world’s 58,700 large dams, those in California were built for yesterday’s more stable climate patterns. But as climate change taxes the world’s water systems—affecting rainfall, snowmelt, and evaporation—it’s getting tough to predict how much water gets to a dam, and when. Dams are increasingly either water-starved, unable to maintain supplies of power and water for their communities, or overwhelmed and forced to release more water than desired—risking flooding downstream. But at one major dam in Northern California, operators have been demonstrating how to not just weather these erratic and intense storms, but capitalize on them. Management crews at New Bullards Bar, built in 1970, entered last winter armed with new forecasting tools that gave unprecedented insight into the size and strength of the coming storms—allowing them to strategize how to handle the rain. First, they let the rains refill their reservoir, a typical move after a long drought. Then, as more storms formed at sea, they made the tough choice to release some of this precious hoard through their hydropower turbines, confident that more rain was coming. “I felt a little nervous at first,” says John James, director of resource planning at Yuba Water Agency in northern California. Fresh showers soon validated the move. New Bullards Bar ended winter with plumped water supplies, a 150 percent boost in power generation, and a clean safety record. The strategy offers a glimpse of how better forecasting can allow hydropower to adapt to the climate age. Modeling studies have long suggested that better weather forecasts would be invaluable for dam managers. Now this is being confirmed in real life. New Bullards Bar is one of a half-dozen pilot sites teaming up with the US Army Corps of Engineers to test how cutting-edge forecasting can be used to optimize operations in the real world. Early tests of the methods, called forecast-informed reservoir operations, have given operators the confidence to hold 5-20 percent reserve margins beyond their reservoirs’ typical capacity, says Cary Talbot, who heads the initiative for the Army Corps.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",us,True,True

Itsvast oil and gas depositsare the mainstay of the country's economy.The region, in the southernmost part of the country, features coastal barrier islands, mangroves, freshwater swamp forests and lowland rain forests. The coast offers various ways of making a living, like fishing, tourism, producing salt, and farming coconut and bananas.Yet it is estimated that over 47% of the population in the regionlivesbelow the poverty line.We study the economic aspects of environmental issues, and in a recentpaperset out to understand the relationship between the destruction of coastalecosystemsin this region and theeconomic hardshipthe people faced.We found that marine ecosystems had been badly affected by a number of factors, including an increasing population, pollution, over-fishing, damaging fishing techniques and global warming.The degradation of the environment affects the poor the most as they depend on natural resources like seafood and wood for survival and energy. And they do not earn enough to relocate from polluted areas.The destruction of an ecosystemWe identified a few areas where the Niger Delta ecosystem had been badly affected. The environmental problems in communities like Bille, Andoni, Okirika, Emohua and Ibaa in Rivers State are caused by oil spills, gas flaring, human activities andwater pollution, among others.Between 1976 and 2006, there were at least7,000 oil spillsin the region, affecting an area of more than 2,500 square kilometers. Theseoil spillshave polluted the soil, water and air, and they have had adevastating impacton the people who live in the region. The destruction of the ecosystem has led to environmental problems like flooding and soil erosion, which destroys homes and crops, leading to further poverty. The lack of a healthy ecosystem has led tohealth problemsfor the people living in the region.Gas flaring is the process of burning off excess natural gas that is produced during oil drilling. More than 2.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas areflaredevery day in the Niger Delta. This processemits greenhouse gasesand other pollutants into the atmosphere, and it also wastes a valuable resource that could be used to generate electricity or heat homes.Mangroves are being lostbecause of water pollution. Mangrove forests are an important source of food and income for local communities, and their loss has led to a decline in fish stocks and othermarine resources. This has damaged the livelihoods of fishers and increased the price of fish in local markets.The environmental consequences of the destruction of mangroves include erosion and increased vulnerability to storms and flooding.Natural resources such as nutrient-rich soil, water, trees and fossil fuels abound inmarine ecosystems. Excessive exploitation of these resources through mining, logging and oil drilling has had a negative impact.Animals in an ecosystem keep the food chain in balance. Due to overfishing and hunting, many animals are disappearing from the Niger Delta. Manatees, sea turtles, dolphins, monkeys, antelope and others are under threat.The destruction of the ecosystem in the Niger Delta has led to a cycle of poverty:depletion of resources means people can't make a livingenvironmental problemslike flooding andsoil erosiondestroy homes and cropshuman health depends on a healthy ecosystem.There isevidencethat destruction of the ecosystem has led to poverty in the Niger Delta region. Increasing soil sterility and diminishing agricultural output haveforcedfarmers to move or seek illicit sources of living. The degradation of traditional fishing grounds has worsened hunger and poverty in fishing communities.Protecting and restoring ecosystemsThe impact of environmental degradation will only worsen if nothing is done to protect and restore degraded ecosystems.In our paper we made the following suggestions.Regulate human activities: Fishing and hunting in the region should be controlled to prevent the depletion of fish and wildlife. Industrial activities, such as oil drilling and shipping, should also be regulated to prevent further pollution of the air, water and soil.Restore degraded ecosystems: Mangrove forests can be replanted in areas where they have been destroyed. Another example is restoring wildlife populations through captive breeding programs and releasing animals back into their natural habitats.Build the capacity of local communities to manage their natural resources: This is essential for the long-term protection of the region. One example is providing training to community members on sustainable fishing and hunting practices. Another example is givinglocal communitiesa say in how their natural resources are managed.Establish marine protected areas: This would help to conserve marine life and ensure that coastal communities can continue to benefit from the resources they depend on. One example is the Calabar-Oron Marine Protected Area in Cross River and Akwa Ibom states. It is home to a variety of marine life, including dolphins, turtles and whales. The area is used for sustainable fishing, ecotourism and research.We also recommend steps to address the root causes of poverty and inequality.Provide access to quality education and health care: Education can help to create greater awareness about environmental issues, and lead to economic opportunities. Availability of these social services could reduce the appeal of rebel groups that promise economic and social benefits.Address marginalization: Groups like women and ethnic minorities can be given equal access to resources and opportunities through inclusive decision-making at the local, state and national levels. Development programs should target their specific needs.Finally, renewed efforts should be made to address conflict and insecurity in the Niger Delta by strengthening governance and the rule of law. Improved governance can lead to stronger enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, which can protect ecosystems from further degradation. In addition, it can protect land rights and create a more stable environment that offers economic opportunities.","['nigeria', 'nigeria', 'nigeria', 'nigeria', 'germany', 'not found']",gb,False,False

[+] Palestinian targets in the northern Gaza Strip January 1, 2009 as seen from Israel's border. (Photo by David Silverman/Getty Images) First, it is important to acknowledge that in the case of ongoing conflicts such as the one between Israel and Hamas, the war in Ukraine and the coup in Niger, wounds are still fresh and complexities of the human cost grow each day. But it’s also important to consider the environmental impacts of conflicts around the world, which could take generations to reverse. The conflict in Ukraine, since 2014 and especially with Russia's invasion in 2022, has resulted in casualties, refugees and economic turmoil. It has also caused air, water, land and soil pollution, damaging ecosystems and posing hazards to neighboring countries. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute noted more than 2,000 instances of what would qualify as environmental crimes under Ukraine’s criminal code. This is particularly disturbing because Drs. Jiayi Zhou and Ian Anthony published findings that Ukraine is home to 35% of Europe’s biodiversity. Hundreds of protected areas are currently or have been under occupation. That includes roughly 23 national parks as well as nature and biosphere reserves. Being under occupation means the areas are exposed to waste and pollution associated with military equipment and supplies. Explosions and chemicals used in warfare have contaminated soil and water, causing what the European Parliament estimates to be more than $55 billion in environmental damage. Meanwhile, the fallout from the July coup in Niger continues. The conflict’s roots in resentment against France over resource extraction (Uranium, oil, gas) combine with the land degradation associated with conflict to create a political and climate crisis. The International Rescue Committee reports that drought-flood cycles have led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. Tensions around the military junta have made humanitarian assistance extremely limited and climate remediation impossible. This highlights the idea that the combined effects of climate change and armed conflict are leading to increased humanitarian needs, displacement and food insecurity. Aid agencies have called for additional support from the international community to help them deliver food aid and other assistance in Niger. Then there is the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Similar to Ukraine and Niger, the conflict has led to catastrophic destruction of critical infrastructure, leaving Gaza without energy resources and water at points. The dense nature of the area made the human impact of the situation more acute. Included in the cascading impacts of the conflict are the environmental damage and public health crises. The continued damage to wastewater infrastructure in Gaza due to attacks and explosive weapons use is of concern now, but it was already suffering from the impacts of decades of conflict. The results are poor water, sanitation and hygiene provisions, alongside uncontrolled discharge of untreated wastewater. Long term, these can cause sickness and increase the rate of chronic illness. Agriculture and water access will also be affected. The bombings and missile attacks also contribute to the environmental threat. Munitions generally contain heavy metals and other “forever chemicals” that can remain a threat to the health of both humans and ecosystems for decades after the end of any conflict. These chemicals impact air and soil quality as well as water quality. Because of the repeated waves of conflict in the area, there is damage to the built environment and natural systems like fauna and tree cover. This makes Gaza and nearby areas prone to drought-flood cycles. With the latest climate change projections indicating potential increases in extreme rainfall, this situation will only worsen. In addition to a growing list of troubles, all of Israel will have to contend with reduced climate resilience. Similar to Ukraine and Niger, continual armed conflict hinders opportunities for remediation and investment. The conflict and the continued use of explosive weapons reduce Gaza's climate resilience, given existing infrastructure constraints. Peter Schwartzstein of the Wilson Center writes about the importance of environmental peace-building, “You cannot disconnect the environment and natural resources like water from a conflict’s wider dynamics,” which means both past wins in addressing climate change and present opportunities are lost. There are options, even in times of conflict, to address some of these issues. Under international law, the Geneva Conventions specifically, there are provisions for different kinds of protected areas or “zones.” Demilitarized zones, safety zones and humanitarian corridors are some examples of areas where either no military activity is allowed or temporarily suspended. Several international organizations have called for humanitarian corridors to be opened for allowing emergency food, medicine and evacuation of vulnerable groups. These corridors can also be used for emergency infrastructure repair and water treatment. Demilitarized zones could be created near priority areas for environmental protection, but to preserve critical ecosystems and to create safe areas for the population. Similar concepts have been suggested by the International Committee of the Red Cross. These examples illustrate how wars and armed conflicts not only cause immediate human suffering but also have severe and lasting environmental consequences. The existence of conflict and suggestions for solutions highlight the interconnectedness of environmental, humanitarian and geopolitical issues in conflict zones. For a sustainable future, addressing these topics in and out of times of conflict is essential.","['israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'niger', 'niger', 'niger', 'niger', 'russia', 'france']",us,False,False

 / Another wide-ranging set of announcements from the tec… [+10447 chars]",Netherlands,"People shopping for electric vehicles, heat pumps, or air conditioning units will see enhanced search results on Google in a series of updates the company hopes will help people live more sustainable, climate-friendly lives. The tech giant revealed the new updates alongside a host of expanded AI tools for people and policymakers to reduce tailpipe emissions and better predict floods, wildfires, and extreme heat. As the effects of climate change intensify, Google has taken to routinely rolling out packages of updates aimed at helping individuals and organizations reduce their carbon footprint. Taken together, today’s announcements represent a renewed effort by the company to help the world mitigate the impact of climate change and better prepare for a future dominated by climate upheaval, said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. “Fighting climate change is humanity’s next big moonshot” “Fighting climate change is humanity’s next big moonshot,” Pichai said in a video message shared with reporters. “And as with any moonshot, we’re going to have to answer some big questions to get there.” There’s a lot that’s being announced today, so here’s the rundown: EV search results Electric vehicle sales are growing by leaps and bounds as more models hit dealerships. And EV newbies are increasingly looking for trusted information to help them decide whether they’re ready to make the switch. Into the fray steps Google, which wants to be a one-stop shop for anyone looking to electrify their life. The company is rolling out new search results for EV shoppers by including information about possible government incentives, like the federal EV tax credit in the US. That way, people can see whether the vehicle they have their eyes on qualifies for any discounts. The improved search results are already live in the US and will be hitting France and Germany later this year. EV owners will also get more details about battery range when searching for specific models on Google. In particular, they’ll see information about how they can drive on a single charge and will be able to customize routes based on elevation changes and speed limits so they can determine how many charging stops they’ll need along the way. The battery range explorer is launching in the US and will be available in Europe early next year. Estimating accurate battery range in an EV is a bit of a moving target, subject to a lot of external factors such as temperature. Google is pulling information about the car, such as the mass and battery size, from the Knowledge Graph , Google’s database of billions of facts about people, places, and things. The company is also sourcing road load data from the EPA, which captures factors such as rolling friction, aerodynamics, and mechanical friction. Google is also rolling out an updated fuel cost calculator for electric and gas car search results, giving people the ability to compare their per-mile costs. This will allow people to calculate potential savings when switching from gas to electric powertrains. This feature is now available in 21 countries around the world. Lastly, fuel-efficient routing, which uses AI to suggest routes with fewer hills, less traffic, and constant speeds with the same or similar ETA, is being expanded to India and Indonesia — two populous nations with major pollution problems. Cycling and transit For people who want to use non-car modes of transportation, Google is collaborating with local governments to update its cycling routes in Google Maps. For example, by working with Transport for London, Google is adding hundreds of kilometers of new bike lanes to its navigation tools. This builds on a long-term project at Google to provide an easier way to get better multimodal directions for people who want to use multiple sustainable modes of transportation, like cycling, transit, and walking. Meanwhile, in France, Google is piloting a new feature that suggests public transit and walking routes alongside your driving route “if they’re practical and comparable in time,” said Yael Maguire, vice president of geo sustainability. Aviation Google’s sustainable aviation project is getting bigger. Earlier this year, the company announced that it was partnering with American Airlines and Bill Gates’ climate investment fund, Breakthrough Energy, to chart more sustainable flight routes . The aim was to help pilots limit a flight’s impact on the climate by avoiding routes that create contrails, those white streaks in the sky that planes sometimes leave behind. Now, the contrail effort is growing to include the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, or Eurocontrol. This group manages aviation for a number of nations, including Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, as well as northwest Germany. Eurocontrol will now use Google’s tools to advise pilots flying through the region how to better avoid creating contrails and reduce emissions. Project Green Light In 2021, Google announced a new effort to reduce carbon emissions in cities called Project Green Light, an AI-driven effort to make traffic lights more efficient, thereby decreasing pollution. Typically, stop-and-go traffic results in more carbon emissions, which has the effect of polluting the air in dense cities and worsening health conditions for residents. Intersections, in particular, are found to be especially dirty, with pollution rates up to 29 times higher than on open roads . Half the emissions at traffic intersections can be linked to vehicles stopping and starting, according to Google’s analysis of driving trends leveraging Department of Energy models. Project Green Light uses AI to help traffic engineers tweak traffic lights so cars and trucks travel more smoothly, with less stopping and starting. Google claims the tools are extraordinarily easy to implement, activating in just five minutes using existing traffic management infrastructure. Google says that early numbers from test cities indicate that Project Green Light can reduce stops by as much as 30 percent. Today, Google announced it was expanding Project Green Light to over a dozen cities, including Rio de Janeiro, Manchester, Jakarta, and Budapest — with more cities planned for later this year. Home improvements Google will show more details about sustainable energy devices for people searching for appliances like heat pumps and air conditioning units. When people search about home heating and cooling systems like “boilers” or “air conditioning,” they’ll see information about other sustainable options, including their capabilities, their energy efficiency, and important financial government incentives. Searching for “furnace,” for example, will show information about types of heating systems, how they compare to energy-saving options such as heat pumps, and potential savings through tax credits and incentives for each. The search results use data provided by the Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy Star, energy.gov in the US, and the International Energy Agency in the EU. Solar panels and ‘cool roofs’ Sustainable choices aren’t just for individuals. To help cities better include solar energy in their development plans, Google is updating Google Earth to make it easier for planners to determine the best building designs and solar options for urban areas. This new tool aims to provide urban planners with an understanding of the solar reflectivity of different surface areas, combined with insights to enable cities to better identify which neighborhoods would benefit most from investments, and allocate resources accordingly. Google sees this as being particularly useful when planning to build places with large roofs, like parking garages. Google’s “cool roofs” tool, which uses AI and aerial imagery to map out the solar reflectivity of cities so urban planners and governments can identify which areas would benefit most from deploying a cool roof solution, such as a white roof, is also growing to include more cities in the coming weeks. Flood, heat, and wildfire warnings As the world warms, more and more populations are finding themselves at risk of natural disasters, whether it’s flooding, extreme heat, or wildfires. Google sees its role as helping mitigate the impact of these disasters by providing information to decision-makers so they can be prepared ahead of time. Or, as The Verge ’s Justine Calma wrote last year: Half of the world lacks adequate early warning systems for disasters like floods and fires, a United Nations report found last month. That’s a lack of lifesaving technology that can give people enough lead time to get themselves to safety. The hope is that Google’s services can fill in some gaps, especially as climate change makes floods and fires even more dangerous than they were in the past. Today, the company is expanding its Flood Hub tool to the US and Canada, adding those nations to a list that includes around 80 other countries that use the feature. The hub will cover 800 riverside locations where some 12 million people currently live. In 2020 , Google also started offering users in the US a map feature that shows wildfire boundaries in near real time. The company says it’s working with the US Forest Service to update its fire spread model, which would be “the biggest update in 50 years.” Google says it’s using machine learning to “model more fire dynamics to help fire authorities train firefighters, plan effective fuel treatments and battle large-scale fires more safely and effectively while in the field.” Lastly, Google is expanding its “tree canopy” tool, which uses AI to help cities keep their residents cool by mapping out where trees are needed most, to 2,000 additional cities globally. The costs of AI Asked about the climate impact of AI, Google said it was challenging to predict the future growth of data centers, for example, as AI use cases expand and evolve. “If we look historically at research and also our own experience, it’s that AI compute demand has gone up much more slowly than the power needed for it,” Kate Brandt, chief sustainability officer at the company, told reporters. Brandt added that using new versions of TPUs, or tensor processing units, has proved to be faster and more efficient than previous versions. And data centers are being redesigned to be more energy-efficient and sustainable altogether. “We’re about 1.5 times as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center,” she said. “And of course, we’re driving towards carbon free energy in our data center operation.” Comments","['unitedstates', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'france', 'france', 'germany', 'germany', 'india', 'indonesia', 'indonesia', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'belgium', 'netherlands', 'luxembourg', 'brazil', 'hungary', 'canada']",us,True,False

""You should always be prepared.""TheNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationsays theweather phenomenon—which means ""little boy"" in Spanish—got its name from South American fishermen who first noticed periods of unusually warm water in the Pacific Ocean in the 1600s.""The full name they used was El Niño de Navidad, because El Niño typically peaks around December,"" NOAA says.El Niño can affect global weather significantly by causing a weakening of the trade winds that typically blow west over the equator and across the Pacific, and by causing the Pacific jet stream to move south, according to NOAA.""Typically, moderate to strong El Niño conditions during the fall and winter result in wetter-than-average conditions from southern California to along the Gulf Coast and drier-than-average conditions in the Pacific Northwest and Ohio Valley,"" NOAA says.And this year, El Niño is strong, Ganguly says.During an El Niño pattern, winter means the chances for warmer-than-average temperatures across the northern states increase, while conditions in the Northeast will be wetter than in the West and Midwest, Ganguly says.In Southern states, El Niño increases the chance of flooding and wild storms, he says.El Niño and its opposingclimate pattern—La Niña for ""little girl,"" when Pacific waters are colder than normal—occur every two to seven years but not on a regular basis, according to NOAA. La Niña is associated with colder Pacific temperatures.Theweather patternsassociated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation typically last nine to 12 months, are most noticeable in the fall and winter, and taper off in the spring, Ganguly says.""El Niño causes many changes in weather patterns across the globe,"" Ganguly says.""It has been called the 'seesaw' effect"" for the way it causes floods in Peru and parts of South America and droughts in the Sahel section of Africa, he says. The Sahel extends from northern Senegal on the Atlantic Ocean into Sudan.El Niño's weather patterns, though complex, change global atmospheric circulation in known ways.A question that remains is how it interacts with climate change, Ganguly says. ""The oceans are already warm. How does El Niño interact with that warming? I don't think we know that well yet.""Climate change is already making extremes more extreme at both ends of the spectrum, Ganguly says. Cold snaps may become less frequent but more intense and longer lasting, for instance, he says.There is some evidence to show that El Niño could amplify fluctuations, but that is still being debated, Ganguly says. He points to aMarch 2023 article in Time magazinethat says the natural periodic temperature increases associated with El Niño—the last strong one was in 2015—are no excuse for abandoning efforts to combat climate change.""Each El Niño signature is different and manifests itself in different ways,"" Ganguly says.

This causes tremendous challenges on how to live there and protect these coasts.A Dutch-Indonesian team of scientists jointly investigated the potential and limitation of mangrove restoration as a cost-effective andsustainable solutionforcoastal protectionin rapidly subsiding areas.They have published their findings inNature Sustainability.Vulnerable coastlinesUnfortunately, precisely in these rural densely populated Asian regions, mangroves have in the past been cleared to free up land for other uses such as aquaculture. This has made these coasts vulnerable to rapid erosion. Restoring mangroves seems a logical solution to reverse this process and protect these densely populated coastlines. However, this requires understanding if mangroves can cope with extreme rates of relative sea level rises, as experienced in these subsiding areas.Since 2015 NIOZ researcher Celine van Bijsterveldt visited Indonesia regularly during her studies and her Ph.D. ""I saw how much the people suffered from coastal erosion and frequent inundation,"" Van Bijsterveldt says. ""To be able to answer if mangroves can help, I started with obtaining reliable measurements of the subsidence rate. This is extremely complicated if you work so remote.""Local land subsidence causes high relative sea level rise""Typically, measuring subsidence requires expensive complicated equipment,"" says Van Bijsterveldt. ""As such instruments are lacking in theseremote areas, we developed two novel and low-cost methods to approximate relative sea-level rise. In the mangroves we measured the sea level rise by simple pressure gauges, that are normally used to measure tides.""""And in the village we analyzed how often people increased the height of the floor and the roof of their houses. Doing so we demonstrate how 20 km of rural coastline and its vegetated foreshore, neighboring a rapidly subsiding city, were experiencing alarming rate of sea level rise."" Surprisingly, villages experienced much higher rates of sea level rise thanmangrove forests, with dramatic consequences for local communities.""By interviews, we learned thatlocal communitiesmay respond in two ways to the experienced sea level rise: fight (keep the water out by raising the house) or flight (move further land inward or elsewhere),"" says Van Bijsterveldt. Flood-prone coastal communities may not always be able to move to higher grounds. Financial and/or social limitations, such as landownership and income source (for instance fisheries) may bind families to the coast.A house in a coastal village during a high tide. The pavement and driveway to the house are flooded. The house remains dry because the residents have raised the ground floor by several tens of centimetres over the past few years. Credit: Silke Tas.Nature-based solutions make mangrove restoration possibleMangroves offer coastal protection by preventingcoastal erosionand attenuating waves moving to the coast. Such protection will however only work if there is enough mangrove forest to do the job. Van Bijsterveldt's research discovered that mature mangroves showcased an extreme high level of tolerance to subsidence and the resulting ""experienced"" rapid sea level rise.But an adequate supply of sediment needs to be available along the shore. ""Unfortunately, the latter is not the case near Semarang,"" says professor Helmi from Diponegoro University. ""But this finding is very promising for many less fast subsidingrural areasalong muddy coast, as we can find in Indonesia and many other places around the world.""Outlook for strongly subsiding areasOverall, present study highlights the urgency of addressingland subsidenceas a critical factor influencing coastal vulnerability. In areas where the experienced relative sea level rise caused by subsidence is not compensated by sufficient sediment supply, the mangroves' ability to stabilize the coastline will deteriorate.This will result in the gradual inland migration of themangroveforest. Rural communities are left with little choice but to also retreat landward. In this respect, the present study offers a future perspective on the fate of global coastal communities under accelerated global sea level rise.""This study provides a glimpse into the future for poor rural areas on the coast struggling with experienced accelerated sea level rise due to subsidence,"" says professor Helmi from Diponegoro University. ""By showing the intricate dynamics between mangroves and their environment, Van Bijsterveldt's findings contribute to develop effective strategies for mitigating the impacts of these pressing issues.""""This glimpse in the future has only been possible because of the unique international and interdisciplinary collaboration,"" says professor Tjeerd Bouma from NIOZ and Utrecht University.""Only by bringing together ecologists, coastal physicists and sociologists from Indonesia and the Netherlands, it was possible to get an integrated perspective on the whole coast.

Authorities say severe weather conditions, characterised by heavy rain and gale-force winds from the east, pose a significant threat to communities and infrastructure in several countries. The gale-force winds have struck hardest in the eastern part of Denmark's Jutland peninsula, including the Danish islands in the Baltic Sea. However, the British Isles, southern Sweden, northern Germany, and parts of Norway are also enduring the impact of this formidable storm, named Babet by the UK's Met Office. Scandinavia sees high water levels In southern Denmark, low-lying areas are submerged, and fallen trees have littered the landscape. The Danish Meteorological Institute's ""very dangerous weather"" warning predicts that water levels will rise, with some inland Danish areas expected to see river surges up to 240cm above normal. “The large amount of water is now on its way back through the Danish belts, which, however, act as bottlenecks, where the water has difficulty moving through and thus piles up south of here.” The DMI stated on the front page of its website. “The strong easterly wind also contributes to the elevated water level and worsens the situation so that the water level becomes even higher.” Sweden is also grappling with the risk of extensive flooding along its southern coast, potentially causing limited access to roads and railways. However, the situation is expected to improve on Saturday morning as water levels recede. Norway has not been spared, with a bridge near its second-largest city closed and widespread cancellations in ferry and air travel, leading to delays and disruptions. First death in UK as much of the country elevates to amber warning In the United Kingdom, a rare red weather alert, signifying the highest level of warning, was issued for parts of Scotland. Authorities predicted ""exceptional rainfall"" in the following days, resulting in extensive flooding and a significant risk to life due to fast-flowing or deep floodwater. This marks the first red alert in the UK since 2020. The affected regions in Scotland have already experienced evacuations, school closures, and widespread disruption. Storm Babet has already claimed its first fatality as a woman was swept into a river in Scotland amid gale-force winds and flooding. Amber warnings for wind and rain have been issued for parts of northern England, the Midlands, and northern Wales. Northern Ireland is also under a yellow warning. The Environment Agency's Flood line service has issued multiple flood warnings and alerts in England, particularly in areas around Bristol, the Midlands, and Yorkshire, with additional warnings along the east coast. Northern Ireland is under a yellow rain warning, and Scotland faces amber and yellow warnings for rain and wind. Major roads, including sections of the A9 and A90, have been closed due to flooding, and train services in affected areas have been suspended. Ferry services to various islands and regional air flights are also cancelled. The Met Office's weather warnings now encompass nearly all of the UK's eastern seaboard, with rain and wind warnings extending from Essex to Berwick and northwards into Scotland. As Storm Babet continues its destructive path across northern Europe, authorities are tirelessly working to safeguard lives and mitigate the extensive damage caused by the extreme weather.","['turkey', 'turkey', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'unitedstates', 'sweden', 'sweden', 'germany', 'norway', 'norway', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom']",eu,False,False

They're also a natural cleansing station for the water, which is then used to irrigate communal gardens.The experiment is part of a research project calledStopUPthat received EU funding to come up with new ways to prevent stormwaters from carrying pollutants into rivers, lakes and bays.The project's focus is onurban runoff—rainwater that accumulates pollutants from streets, rooftops and other places as it washes through cities—and on overflowing sewers. The goal is to ensure that such wastewater, which can contain everything from plastics to pesticides, gets treated.""StopUP technologies and methods could provide tools that practitioners use to plan and implement measures to reduce stormwater pollution,"" said Professor Thomas Wintgens, head of the Institute of Environmental Engineering at RWTH Aachen University in Germany.Wintgens coordinates StopUP, which began in September 2022 and is due to run through August 2025.While 98% of people in the EU have access to basic sanitation services and more than 90% of urban wastewater is handled in line with European legislation dating to 1991, contamination remains a big challenge.In Europe, 38% of surface waterbodies have various forms of pollution, according to theEuropean Environment Agency.Pollution tracksHuman health depends on clean water for drinking, bathing and cooking. The health of the ecosystem is also at stake because plants and animals are affected by chemicals in rivers, lakes and coastal waters.""While a lot of progress has been made on wastewater treatment in the EU, the impact of residual emissions coming from urban runoff and sewer overflows is important,"" said Wintgens.In collaboration with 11 universities and companies from Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Tunisia and the UK, StopUP is developing technologies to improve understanding about where pollutants come from and how they get into waterbodies. Typical pollutants include nutrients, hydrocarbons, heavy metals and microbial contaminants.In the German city of Aachen near the Dutch and Belgian borders, StopUP is testing a sand-based filtration system to curb pollution from sewer overflows into the river Wurm. The technique being deployed—called a ""retention soil filter""—consists mainly of sand with a bottom drainage layer of gravel and reeds planted on the surface.In Antwerp, Belgium's second-largest city after Brussels and ahead of Ghent, the researchers are experimenting with a gravel filter to treat urban runoff.""This is an important field of research—very relevant for communities and the environment,"" said Wintgens, who has two decades of experience in water management and wastewater treatment.Squirming in the rainLuz Herrero is another expert in this field.Head of environmental technology at AIMEN Technology Center near Vigo in western Spain, she coordinates a separate EU-funded project to tackle water runoff in cities.CalledWATERUN, it is scheduled to last for four years through May 2026.Herrero, who has worked on technologies to tackle environmental challenges for the past 18 years, said a big gap can exist between popular perceptions of rainwater and its true composition.""It may seem that rainwater is very clean, but when it washes the streets and roofs it becomes loaded with dust, residues of animal feces, microplastics and other toxic pollutants,"" she said. ""Diffuse pollution can have significant negative impacts on human well-being and ecosystem health.""For instance, health costs in Europe associated with the presence of nitrate—a chemical often used as a fertilizer—in drinking water exceed €1 billion a year, according to theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.Herrero said a ""knowledge gap"" exists about where exactly the pollution originates and how it is spread through water.In response, WATERUN is developing sensors forpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs)—chemicals from coal, oil and petrol—to be placed in urban catchments. It's also seeking to identify the source and distribution of pollutants.The project is carrying out on-the-ground studies in three cities with very different climates: Aarhus in Denmark, Santiago de Compostela in Spain and Amman in Jordan.The three cities are also at different stages of action, with Aarhus the frontrunner and Santiago de Compostela still gearing up.Aarhus, with nearby lakes, a river basin and a bay, is focusing on ponds in the city center. Its goal is to remove 70% of microplastics, phosphorus and PAHs, which can accumulate in the ground and damage soils, plants and animals.""In Aarhus they have already put in place infrastructures to deal with urban water runoff,"" said Herrero.The WATERUN researchers plan to draw on the threecase studiesto produce guidelines for city authorities on how best to tackle urban runoff.Climate influencesThe research is even more important because of acceleratingclimate change, which is causing more frequent—and increasingly severe—storms and floods along with rising temperatures and worsening heat waves.""It can only exacerbate the problem due to changing precipitation patterns and extreme rainfall,"" said Herrero.Wintgens highlighted another climatic connection, saying droughts pose a challenge for the researchers themselves.""If it doesn't rain for months on a specific site, we cannot sample anything,"" he said.But the fundamental point is the importance ofclean water.""Let's not forget about water quality,"" Wintgens said.

The death toll has risen to at least 14 people afterfloodingin India’s northeastern state of Sikkim that came after heavy rainfall caused the glacial Lhonak lake to overflow. At least 26 people were also injured and 102 others, including23 army personnel, were reported missing, officials said on Thursday. Sikkim received 40.9 millimetres of rainfall between Tuesday and Wednesday morning, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) – almost five times its normal rate of 8.6mm for this time of the year. The water surge came after intense rainfall burst the high-altitude Lhonak lake, which sits at the base of a glacier in peaks surrounding the world’s third-highest mountain, Kangchenjunga. The wall of water powered downstream, adding to a river already swollen by monsoon rains, damaging a dam, sweeping away houses and bridges, and causing “serious destruction”, the Sikkim state government said. Roads had been “severely” damaged and 14 bridges had been washed away along the banks of the Teesta river. According to a defence ministry spokesperson, search operations for the missing troops are under way. However, the search has been hampered by the collapse of the main highway linking Sikkim to the West Bengal state and Gangtok, the capital of the northeastern state. GT Dhungel, a member of the Sikkim Legislative Assembly, told Reuters news agency that petrol and diesel had already become scarce in Gangtok but food was easily available. The damage was recorded more than 120km (75 miles) downstream and about 22,000 people living in the vicinity are likely to be affected, officials said. Video footage from the ANI news agency showed flood waters surging into built-up areas where several houses collapsed, army bases and other facilities were damaged and vehicles submerged. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised “all possible support” for those affected. Lhonak lake shrunk by nearly two-thirds in size, an area roughly equivalent to about 150 football pitches (105 hectares), satellite photographs released by the Indian Space Research Organisation showed. Himalayan glaciers are melting faster than ever due to climate change, exposing communities to unpredictable and costly disasters, according to the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) research group. “We observe that such extreme events increase in frequency as the climate continues to warm and takes us into unknown territory,” said Miriam Jackson, a scientist specialising in ice who monitors Himalayan regions with the Nepal-based ICIMOD. Earth’s average surface temperature has risen nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius since preindustrial times, but high-mountain regions around the world have warmed at twice that pace, climate scientists say, posing a greater risk across the widerHimalayan mountain range. Other mountainous areas of India, as well as parts of neighbouring Pakistan and Nepal have been hit by torrential rains, flooding and landslides in recent months, killing many people.

A flood that ... [+] started in a glacial lake destroyed a 1,200 megawatt hydropower dam and then washed away homes and bridges, forcing thousands to flee. (Photo by Biplov Bhuyan) Last week, a flood on the Teetsa River swept through villages in the Himalayan mountains of India, taking out bridges and homes. At least 40 people were killed, with more than a hundred people still missing. The root of the disaster appeared to be a natural one, as an avalanche sent ice and boulders tumbling into a large glacial lake, causing it to overflow as a wall of water that surged downstream. But, as with most disasters, it’s hard to call this one strictly “natural” because human-caused climate change has made this type of event—a “glacial lake outburst flood”—more likely. As the massive wave swept downstream, it obliterated the Teetsa-3 dam, a 1200 megawatt hydropower dam that was only a decade old and cost 1.5 billion USD to construct. This sudden loss of major infrastructure underscores another risk that climate change is amplifying: the vulnerability of hydropower and other dams to damage or destruction from floods that will continue to grow in magnitude. South Lhonak Glacial Lake (upper red box and upper right photo) and the Teetsa III Hydropower Dam ... [+] (lower red box and lower right photo). A ""glacial lake outburst flood"" from South Lhonak destroyed the 1,200 MW Teetsa III dam and also killed at least 40 people. Beyond the loss of expensive infrastructure, this rising flood risk to dams can pose real danger to people living downstream, as was tragically demonstrated last month in Libya when more than 10,000 people were killed the flood unleashed by the collapse of two dams on the Wadi Derna during record-breaking precipitation (note that these were not hydropower dams and the structures had not been maintained in the war-torn country). Left side: The Mansour Dam, before and after it and another upstream dam failed (on September 11, ... [+] 2023). Right side: The city of Derna Libya, before and after the dam-collapse floods devastated the city. These are not isolated incidents, as examples can be found around the world. In 2017, California’s Oroville Dam, the tallest dam in North America, came close to failing—unleashing what would have been a disastrous flood for hundreds of thousands of people living downstream—due to record-breaking precipitation and runoff. Floods damaged hydropower dams and triggered downstream evacuations in Puerto Rico in 2017 and Colombia in 2018. In May of 2020, between four and seven inches of rain drenched central Michigan over a two-day period, resulting in flooding that led to the collapse of two hydropower dams and the evacuation of more than 10,000 people downstream as downtown Midland, Michigan was inundated by nearly 10 feet of water.

[+] the lower part of downtown Midland (MI) on May 20, 2020 following the upstream failure of two hydropower dams. (Photo by Gregory Shamus) While Oroville was a near miss and, due to warnings and evacuations, the Michigan floods were not deadly, a much greater catastrophe occurred in Laos in 2018, when heavy rains led to the collapse of a portion of a hydropower dam, releasing a flash flood with a volume half that of the Mississippi River. The flood rapidly inundated nearly 20 square miles, displacing 6,000 people and killing at least 36 people. These recent events are happening at a time when only 4% of all current hydropower dams are located within areas with the greatest risk of flooding – but that proportion will grow dramatically due to climate change over the next thirty years. I recently led research showing that, by 2050, the proportion of hydropower dams in regions with the highest flood risk will increase five times, to 20% of dams, due to projected climate change driving increases in flood magnitudes across much of the world. Distribution of existing hydropower dams with color indicating the projected change in relative ... [+] flood risk in 2050 under the pessimistic climate scenario. The size of the circle reflects the hydropower capacity of the dam. Further, proposed dams in the planning stage are disproportionately located in regions where flood risks will increase the most: only 2% of currently planned dams are located in regions that today are classified as having the highest flood risk. But by 2050, 40% of all planned dams will be in the regions with the highest risk. These numbers are based on the same set of planned dams; it’s the regions where they are located that are predicted to change over the next three decades. (See this interactive map to explore current and future flood risk for hydropower dams around the world.) The current and rising risk of floods to hydropower, and other, underscores three main points. First is the absolute necessity of minimizing climate change. Global flood losses (all river floods, not just dam-related) will increase quite a bit even if we successfully hit the most ambitious climate target (keeping warming below 1.5° C). With that level of warming, the number of people exposed to river flooding is projected to increase by 50–60% and flood damages are projected to increase by 160–240%. Warming of 2° C would result in a doubling of the people affected by floods and an increase in damages up to 520% compared to today. This is a surprisingly large increase in losses relative to warming of 1.5° C, underscoring that seemingly small differences in temperature can have major differences in disruption to people’s lives. Second is the need to dramatically increase investment in adaptation to climate change. As noted above, flood risk will still rise considerably even if we hold warming to 1.5° C – meaning considerable adaptation will still be needed. There are a number of steps we can take to reduce risks associated with dam failure, encompassing both engineering interventions and Nature-based Solutions. These include retrofitting spillways to safely pass larger floods, managing watersheds to reduce runoff, and integrating better monitoring and forecasting into dam operations. Countries can adapt to increasing flood risk by giving rivers more room to spread out, and avoiding new development in areas at risk of flooding. However, the financial challenge is stark. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that current investment in adaptation is only 5 – 10% of what is needed. Moreover, many countries aren’t even keeping up with the maintenance and rehabilitation needed for current levels of risk. For example, the American Society of Civil Engineers gives a letter grade of “D” to both dams and levees in the United States, noting that rehabilitating these structures to maintain their safety will require more than $100 billion in investment. Removal of aging and obsolete dams is gaining increasing attention as a solution for improving safety - while simultaneously being one of the most dramatic ways to restore river ecosystems (see this earlier post). In the United States, this synergy underpins the collaborative efforts of the hydropower sector, river conservation organizations and Tribes to secure funding for upgrading some dams while removing others, resulting in $2.3 billion in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill for these actions. Beyond climate mitigation and adaptation, the rising flood risk to dams underscores the need to change how we plan future infrastructure. Such planning needs to be based on comprehensive assessments of both current and future risks. In addition to rising flood risk, hydropower dams also face increasing risk from water scarcity that will result in reduced generation, generally during times of greatest demand for electricity, such as during heat waves that spike demand for air conditioning. This needed evolution in planning has implications for project-level development, as future dams should be planned and designed for the hydrological conditions they are likely to experience, not those of even the recent past. But even more importantly, the planning of infrastructure systems should fully consider a range of alternative solutions to these risks, such as land-use planning and reconnecting floodplains to reduce flood risk and diversifying generation technologies to reduce climate-driven risks to energy. For example, solar panels and wind turbines are generally not vulnerable to floods and solar panels operate near their peak capacity during hot, sunny drought periods when other generation sources are stressed (aside from hydropower dams, nuclear and thermal plants also can see generation curtailed during droughts due to depletion of cooling water sources). The recent disasters in India and Nepal are warnings that climate change will drive considerable increased risk to people and energy infrastructure. But we have a range of solutions for reducing that risk while also restoring and protecting nature.","['india', 'india', 'libya', 'libya', 'libya', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'puertorico', 'colombia', 'laos', 'australia', 'nepal']",us,True,True

Heavy rain has hampered the search for 23 Indian soldiers who have gone missing after a flash flood in northeastern Sikkim state, with the capital city of Gangtok cut off by road, defence officials said. The rain lashed a valley about 150km (93 miles) north of Gangtok, located along the border with China. “Due to sudden cloud burst over Lhonak Lake in North Sikkim, a flash flood occurred in the Testa River … 23 personnel have been reported missing,” the army said in a statement on Wednesday. “Search operations are under way.” A defence spokesperson based in Guwahati in the neighbouring Assam state said, “Some army establishments along the valley have been affected.” Rising water submerged some vehicles following the release of water from a dam, the spokesperson said. The remote area lies close to India’s border with Nepal, and Lhonak Lake sits at the base of a glacier in the snowy peaks that surround Kangchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. The army said water released upstream from the Chungthang dam meant the river was already more than 4.5 metres (15 feet) higher than usual. About 15,000 people living in the vicinity are likely to be affected and at least eight major bridges have been washed away along the banks of the Teesta River, VS Pathak, chief secretary of the state, told Reuters news agency. A video released by an Indian army spokesperson showed a thick torrent of raging brown water sweeping down a thickly forested valley, with roads washed away and power lines ripped down. India’s weather department has warned of landslides and disruption to flights as heavy rain is predicted in some parts of Sikkim. Flash floods are common during themonsoon season, which begins in June and normally withdraws from the Indian subcontinent by the end of September. By October, the heaviest of the monsoon rains are usually over. Experts sayclimate changeis increasing their frequency and severity. Other photographs shared by the army showed water submerging the first floor of buildings and flowing down a street in a town with only the tip of a small construction crane visible poking out. Local media showed Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang holding an umbrella during a downpour and talking to officials about floods in the town of Singtam, further downstream from where the soldiers are missing. The monsoon occurs when summer heat warms the landmass of the subcontinent, causing the air to rise and suck in cooler Indian Ocean winds, which then produce enormous volumes of rain. But it also brings yearly destruction in the form oflandslides and floods. Melting glaciers add to the volume of water while unregulated construction in flood-prone areas exacerbates the damage. Due to climate change, Himalayan glaciers are melting faster than ever, exposing communities to unpredictable and costly disasters. Glaciers disappeared 65 percent faster from 2011 to 2020 compared with the previous decade, a report in June by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) warned. Based on current emissions trajectories, the glaciers could lose up to 80 percent of their current volume by the end of the century, it said.

Within this rainy period are sudden and extremely intense cloudbursts, which often ""pop"" over a relatively small area (akin to a cloud bursting open like a balloon).As climate change is making these cloudbursts and other forms of heavy rainfallmore intense and more frequentin the Himalayan foothills, the hilly slopes are becoming saturated more frequently, and thus unstable. Rainfall-triggered landslides are already happening extensively across the Himalayas, and things are likely to get worse.From July to August 2023, the Indian Himalayas, particularly the state of Himachal Pradesh in the northern part of the country, experienced an unprecedented number of cloudbursts which triggered thousands ofdevastating landslides. The state's disaster management authority reported that by the end of August, heavyrainand rainfall-triggered landslides had caused509 fatalities, destroyed at least 2,200 homes anddamaged a further 10,000.It is estimated that Himachal Pradesh's losses from this period amount to US$1.2 billion. Much of the destruction took place during two short periods, one inmid-Julyand one inmid-August.The level of damage to buildings, roads and bridges is extremely difficult to comprehend. Several sections of national and state roads have been washed away, a temple in Shimla collapsed andkilled 20 people, rural dwellings largely constructed on sloped ground were washed away by rain, and houses are still sliding downhill.Schools and hospitals have been damaged, posing an ongoing threat to lives. A school in Kullu district was closed for 52 days because the bridge which connected it to a town had been washed away. Local people have had no option but to live in tents with minimal facilities. They are hugely concerned about their safety ahead of a cold and snowy winter.Four days of heavy rainfall in July 2023 triggered landslides thatblocked around 1,300 roadsincluding five national highways, leaving the state almost cut off from the rest of India. This had huge knock-on effects as1,255 bus routes were suspended, 576 buses were stranded, more than70,000 tourists had to be evacuated, and people could not access key facilities and services. This impeded emergency responders, causing critical delays in search and rescue operations as well as delivery of aid.Across the whole of India, the summer monsoon and its related cloudbursts aredecreasing. But in the Himalayan foothills, they areincreasing significantly—partly because when warm moist air encounters the Himalayan barrier it rapidly lifts and cools, forming large clouds that then dump their rain. With intense rain happening more and more often in the Himalayan foothills, it is likely that 2023's summer of disasters will occur again.Unnecessarily vulnerableAlthoughclimate changemay be to blame for the rise in cloudbursts, in an ideal world rainfall alone needn't lead to disastrous landslides. But the Himalayas have been mademore vulnerableby human actions.The region has largely beendeforested, removingtree rootswhich reinforce the ground and form a crucial barrier that stops soils washing away. And unplanned developments and haphazard construction have destabilized already fragile slopes.Initial reports on this year's landslides suggest the worst damages occurred along artificially cut slopes (for roads or buildings), where there has been a lack of proper provisioning for drainage and slope safety. In both India and Nepal, many of the hill roads have beenhaphazardly constructed, which makes landslides during rainfallmore likely. Construction guidelines andbuilding codesareoutdatedand have been ignored anyway, and there is little assessment of the link between urbanization andlandsliderisk.One obvious solution is to prevent rain from penetrating the ground, so the slopes avoid losing any strength. However, if the soil is entirely prevented from absorbing any rain, the water will instead run off the surface and cause greater flooding problems further downhill.One engineering solution is to place an artificial soil layer above the natural soil to temporarily hold water in the surface when it is raining extremely hard, preventing it penetrating deeper within the slope. This ""climate adaptive barrier layer"" will then release water back to the atmosphere during a later drying period.As the heavy rain intensifies, it will be hugely important for the Himalayas to implement new user-friendly and reliable construction guidelines that factor in how the climate is changing. Landslides can't be avoided entirely, and India certainly won't be able to reverse global warming and the increase in cloudbursts any time soon. But these preventive actions should at least make communities more resilient to the changing climate.","['india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'nepal']",gb,False,False

Though rushed to a nearby hospital within 10 minutes, the doctor on duty referred him to another facility without starting treatment, unaware of snakebite protocols. Abhishek died on the way. This was not just a singular case of fatal snakebite in Nepal’s Terai region, the stretch of Nepal’s lowlands that lie south of the Himalayan foothills and that border India. Madhav Acharya, 60, from a neighboring province, was bitten by a rattlesnake on the night of July 31, while he was sleeping. He was rushed to the medical college in Kohalpur and then referred to a hospital in Bheri, Lumbini province, one of the few that provides treatment for snakebite in the region. He underwent treatment for 17 days and was intubated for 7 days. He survived, but the course of treatment cost him about 250,000 Nepalese rupees ($1886), a princely sum considering the average annual income is 200,000 Nepalese rupees ($1489), according to theIMF. According to theLancet, Nepal records 26,749 to 37,661 snake bites annually, leading to 2,386 to 3,225 deaths. The journal says most of the deaths are of women and children. The UN’sWorld Health Organization (WHO)has added snakebite to the list of neglected tropical diseases, highlighting the need for stronger epidemiological evidence in endemic countries such as Nepal. “Cases of snakebite have increased in Nepal from 2018-19,”Dr. Hemant Ojha, head of the zoonotic department of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division in Nepal’s Ministry of Health and Population, told RT. The Lumbini region saw the maximum cases in 2021-22 while the Madhesh region and the Karnali region also saw a rise. The Terai plains bordering India are most affected. A 2022studyfound 37,661 cases and 3,225 deaths across 23 Terai districts each year. Snakes like cobras, kraits, and vipers are the biggest killers. Nepal’s Home Ministry has listed snakebite as a disaster. The Nepalese Army operates snakebite treatment centers at 23 locations from Jhapa to Kanchanpur, spanning 18 districts, manned by 62 Army personnel supported by 19 health workers connected to local governments. According to Health Ministry spokesperson Sameer Kumar Adhikari, Nepal has set a target of reducing the number of deaths due to snake bites by 50 percent by the year 2030, in line with the WHO’s stated goal of reducing snakebite incidents. To achieve that goal, it is running programs such as raising awareness at the community level, training health workers, increasing the capacity of snakebite treatment centers and providing free anti-snake venom. Keshab Shrestha, the mayor of Buddhabhumi Municipality in Kapilvastu district, is one elected representative who has taken a special interest in operating snakebite treatment centers and raising awareness on preventing snake bites. Shrestha, who is serving a second term as mayor, told RT:”To prevent death from snakebite, we have a treatment center in Gorusinghe with the help of the Nepal Army. We have arranged the necessary building, health workers, medicines, and ambulance for operating the center.” A study in 2019-2020 by experts of theBP Koirala Institute of Health Sciencesfound that 40% of deaths due to snake bites occur in villages, another 40% die on the way to a hospital and about 20% die during treatment at hospitals. Local authorities acknowledge that many additional incidents in remote villages go unreported, while the delay in reaching the hospital, lack of infrastructure, and belief in traditional healers instead of going straight to a hospital are also major reasons for snakebite fatalities. A doctor based in Nepalganj’s state-run healthcare facility, told RT on condition of anonymity that”Lack of awareness, poor healthcare infrastructure and expensive treatment trap victims in a vicious cycle.” “In addition to private hospitals, government hospitals also treat snake bites,”he added. “The Ministry of Health procures close to 2,000 vials of ‘anti-snake venom’ from India every year and provides it free of cost to snakebite treatment centers and government hospitals.” However, he added, ”in practice, there is a major problem. Institutes do not have adequate stocks of anti-venom, there is a shortage of manpower as well as a lack of infrastructure. Also, the treatment is expensive for the poor.” As a result, “people are forced to wait for death at home and depend on witchcraft,” said Dr. Chhabilal Thapa, author of ‘Medically Important Snakes and Snakebite Management in Nepal‘ said.”The government needs to ensure adequate supply of anti-venom, train health workers in snakebite treatment and make it affordable for the masses.” Though the government has declared snakebite treatment free, in reality”victims have to bear heavy expenses for medicines, hospitalization etc,”he added.”This forces them to opt for dangerous alternatives and leads to preventable deaths in many cases.” Dr. Krishna Acharya, Senior Consultant Anesthesiologist atBheri Hospital, Nepalgunjwho treats snakebite victims, told RT that “it takes anywhere between 30 minutes to 10-12 hours for the venom to spread in the body, depending on the species of the poisonous snake.” “Abdominal pain, vomiting, difficulty in breathing are the main symptoms,”he added.”Patients with these symptoms should be rushed to a hospital or snakebite treatment center as soon as possible.” “If a patient is taken to hospital within an hour of snakebite, the chances of saving her are over 90%,”Dr. Acharya said.”That’s why doctors call the first hour after a bite the ‘golden hour’ for treatment.” However, this is not the general practice in Nepalese society where there is a tendency to take the patient only after they become visibly weak, according to Dr. Acharya. As a result, most victims die on the way to a hospital. According todatafrom the Ministry of Health for 2021-22, 926 people reached hospitals last year with snakebite.”Treatment for such patients at hospitals costs at least one lakh [100,000] rupees,”Dr. Acharya said, adding,”This is a very big amount for a family struggling to make ends meet. The government needs to make snakebite treatment completely free or provide financial support to poor families.” The result is that though the government provides free anti-snake venom, patients have to pay out of pocket for other medicines, oxygen, ICU, ventilator, and the dialysis required for treatment. This should be provided free of cost or at highly subsidized rates to all snakebite victims, especially those from marginalized communities, Dr. Acharya believes. “Around 40,000 families are directly affected every year, and close to 3,000 people die, which is a major public health issue in the country,”Dr. Acharya said.”But the Ministry of Health, our political parties, and even the mass media have not given this adequate attention.” He also felt local governments could help by providing free health insurance to residents of snakebite-prone areas. “If the insurance covers all expenses in case of a snakebite, it will reduce snakebite deaths and lessen the financial burden on families,”according to Dr. Dr. Thapa said information on what to do after a snakebite and where to take the patient for treatment has still not reached communities. Other thanKaligandakiHospital in Nawalparasi, no other private hospital, clinic, or medical college in the district (in the southeast corner of Lumbini district, bordering India) treats patients bitten by snakes. Victims also do not get ambulances on time. People don’t even know which hospital is suitable for snakebite treatment. Due to lack of facilities in the hospitals spread out in Terai’s districts (particularly those bordering India’s Terai), where the terrain is hilly and thus not easily accessible, patients bitten by snakes have to travel for hours. Indian Forest Service officer J.P. Singh says in India’s Terai, venomous snakes like Russell’s Viper and the Indian Cobra find sanctuary in forested areas and their populations are regulated by natural predators like peacocks and other wildlife. In Nepal’s Terai, however, dwindling forest cover forces snakes into populated areas, leading to encounters with humans. Abhishek, a Project Manager at the Nature Environment and Wildlife Society, has been working closely with snakes for over two decades. He says the surge in snakebite incidents in Nepal’s Terai can be attributed to heavy rains during monsoon. The rainfall displaces the snakes from Nepal’s hills, which then seek refuge in the low-lying Terai region, where rice cultivation creates a habitat rich in both snakes and their prey, including rodents. This leads to an increased likelihood of human-snake encounters. As a result, patients from districts scattered in Lumbini province and in neighboring Sudurpaschim province, in Nepal’s southwest corner, have to go all the way to Bheri Hospital in Lumbini’s Nepalgunj for treatment. There are many instances of patients dying on the way due to not reaching a hospital on time In the second week of June, 15-year-old Hemanti Joshi from Sukhad, Kailali (in Sudurpaschim province) was bitten by a snake while sleeping on the porch during menstruation. She was taken to Seti Hospital Dhangadhi. She died a week after treatment. There are also incidents of deaths of women and children from snakebites, while residing in theChhaupadi (menstrual hut)in Nepal. In many parts of South Asia, including both in India and in Nepal, menstruation is considered an impurity, and women experiencing it are quarantined from daily life, especially religious rituals. “Women are more prone to snakebite during menstruation and pregnancy. Due to the belief that women should not sleep indoors or on beds during menstruation, they are forced to sleep in courtyards, cattle sheds and makeshift huts making them more vulnerable,”Dr. Acharya said. Herpetologist and International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) specialist group memberKamal Devkotafeels the government, besides reiterating the WHO target for reducing snakebites by 2030, has no clear policies or programs on reducing the harm from snakebites, other than to continue to provide anti-venom for free. “It seems the loss of life and property from floods is increasing every year. But the problem of snakebites in Nepal is listed as a neglected health issue. Snakebite issues are not a priority for the Nepal government or donor agencies either,”he said.","['nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'not found']",ru,False,False

As the war between Hamas and Israeli forcesenters a second dayand dominates the headlines,here are four other stories from around the world you may have missed: The death toll in floods that hit India’s northeastern state ofSikkimhas risen to 77, while over 100 others are missing. Violent torrents struck Sikkim on Wednesday after a high-altitude glacial lake suddenly burst. Police in Jalpaiguri district, situated in the neighbouring West Bengal state, said 48 bodies were recovered on Sunday, including of eightIndian army personnelstationed in Sikkim, a state on the remote frontiers of Nepal and China with a sizeable military presence. Thousands of people remain stranded in relief camps as bad weather delays airlift rescues. Along with destroying major infrastructure, the floods also damaged more than 1,200 houses, according to officials. More than 50 climbers were climbing up the summit of Shishapangma in Tibet when an avalanche crashed into them, killing an American mountaineer and her Nepali guide, China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency reported on Sunday. Two avalanches hit the slopes of Shishapangma, the world’s 14th tallest peak, at elevations of 7,600 metres and 8,000 metres on Saturday, killing the American climber Anna Gutu and her Nepali guide Mingmar Sherpa. Another American climber, Gina Marie Rzucidlo, and her Nepali guide, Tenjen Sherpa, were missing, Xinhua said. Climbers from around the world were pushing up the summit in what is a popular month for mountaineering in the Himalayas with eased monsoon rains making the conditions more stable. California was just about to become the first US state to explicitly outlaw caste-based discrimination – until Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed the bill late on Saturday. Last month, California’s senatepassed a billthat added caste as a form of protected ancestry under state civil rights law, as well as education and housing codes. Newsom called the bill “unnecessary” since the state already prohibits discrimination based on various characteristics such as colour, ancestry and national origin. “Because discrimination based on caste is already prohibited under these existing categories, this bill is unnecessary,” he said in a statement. 1/ Today, California Governor@GavinNewsomvetoed anti-caste discrimination bill#SB403. Though Newsom has rejected the legislation for now, our#casteequitymovement still views this as a win.https://t.co/jlcLn8ZRFOpic.twitter.com/TAKD3D1MZH — Equality Labs (@EqualityLabs)October 8, 2023 The debate around the bill has divided the Indian American community, with rights and social justice groups backing it as the most significant victory in combatting casteism in America. Proponents of the bill launched a hunger strike in early September pushing for the law’s passage. A United Nations report in 2016 said at least 250 million people worldwide still face caste discrimination in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Pacific regions, as well as in various diaspora communities. Caste systems are found among Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Muslims and Sikhs in South Asia. Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Equality Labs, the Oakland-based Dalit rights group that has been leading the movement to end caste discrimination in the US, said she still viewed the moment as a victory for caste-oppressed people who have “organised and built amazing power and awareness on this issue”. Sultan al-Jaber, the president-designate of COP28 to be held in the United Arab Emirates later this year, on Sunday said adaptation must be “front and centre” of theclimate agenda. “We live in a region of extreme heat, water scarcity and food insecurity. We are also suffering harsh climate impacts, from droughts to the devastating floods of Derna,” Jaber said, speaking at the MENA Climate Week in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh. “To deliver for our region we must put adaptation front and centre of the climate agenda.” Jaber also called on governments to abandon “fantasies” of hastily sideling existing energy infrastructure in pursuit of climate goals. “We cannot unplug the energy system of today before we build the new system of tomorrow. It is simply not practical or possible,” he said. COP28is scheduled to take place in the UAE between November 30 and December 12.

At least 10 people have been killed in India’s state of Sikkim and 82 others, including23 army personnel, are missing after heavy rainfall caused the glacial Lhonak Lake to overflow, spurring catastrophic flooding in the region. The northeastern state received 40.9mm (1.6 inches) of rainfall between Tuesday and Wednesday morning, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) – about five times its normal rate of 8.6mm (0.3 inches) for this time of the year. “So far, 10 bodies have been recovered from different locations. At least 82 more are missing and 22 people are injured, some of them seriously,” Sikkim’s Chief Secretary V B Pathak told Reuters news agency. A cloudburst – or an extreme amount of rain over a brief period of time – over Lhonak Lake triggered torrential flooding in the valley located about 150km (93 miles) north of Gangtok near the border with China. “Intense rain has led to this catastrophic situation in Sikkim where the rain has triggered a glacial lake outburst flood and damaged a dam and caused loss of life and caused further damage to roads and infrastructure,” said Miriam Jackson, a senior cryosphere specialist at the Nepal-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. The lake, which sits at the base of a glacier in peaks surrounding the world’s third-highest mountain, Kangchenjunga, had shrunk by nearly two-thirds in size overnight, an area roughly equivalent to 150 football pitches (105 hectares), satellite photographs released by the Indian Space Research Organisation showed. Heavy rainfall hampered the search for the Indian troops reported missing, with the capital city of Gangtok cut off by road, defence officials said. “Twenty-three personnel have been reported missing and some vehicles are reported submerged under the slush. Search operations are under way,” a defence ministry spokesperson said. India’s weather department has warned of landslides and disruption to flights as heavy rain is predicted to continue over the next two days in some parts of Sikkim. Jackson warned that such extreme events have become more frequent “as the climate continues to warm and takes us into unknown territory”. The main highway linking Sikkim to West Bengal state had collapsed and Gangtok was totally cut off by road, according to army spokesperson Anjan Basumatary. About 15,000 people living in the vicinity are likely to be affected and at least eight major bridges have been washed away along the banks of the Teesta River, officials said. Media showed images of the river lashing through the hills and entering residential areas.

Intermittent rain and thunderstorms were hampering rescue operations in the area, an army official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office said in a statement that the government will support state authorities in meeting the challenges from the floods. Violent flooding from glacier lakes dammed by loose rock has become more frequent as global temperatures rise and ice melts, with scientists on Wednesday warning the deadly flood was a taste of further extreme weather events to come. Disasters caused by landslides and floods are common in India’sHimalayan regionduring the June-September monsoon season. The region saw heavy monsoon rains this season, with experts sayingclimate changeis increasing their frequency and severity. Nearly 50 people died in flash floods and landslides in August inHimachal Pradesh, also a Himalayan state. Record rains in July killed more than 100 people over two weeks in northern India, as roads were waterlogged and homes collapsed. In February 2021, flash floods killed nearly 200 people and washed away houses in Uttarakhand.

This week is expected to bethe busiest in yearson the roads and airports could set new records – meaningthis week’s headache-inducing weathercould not come at a worse time. The havoc-wreaking system will track from the southern Plains into the Mississippi Valley on Monday and spread rain across much of the central US. Fortunately for any early week travelers, this rain is not expected to be heavy in most areas. 20 million from Texas to the Southeast at risk of severe storms and tornadoes But a different threat has emerged and could snarl travel for portions of the Gulf Coast late Monday afternoon as the storm moves east:severe thunderstorms, including possible tornadoes. Severe weather, while more common in the spring, can happen any time of the year if there’s enough warmth and moisture in the air. Damaging thunderstorms fired up Monday afternoon in east Texas, where the atmosphere is primed with plenty of moisture and warmth. These storms will track across Louisiana, Arkansas and push into Mississippi from Monday evening into early Tuesday morning. Damaging winds and hail are likely within any of Monday’s severe thunderstorms. Several tornadoes are also possible, especially across Louisiana and Mississippi. A fresh input of atmospheric energy and a robust surge of moisture will charge up the storm’s impacts Tuesday and usher in the most widespread, impactful weather of the week. The issues will start early Tuesday morning in the Southeast, where the severe thunderstorm threat will be highest in southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. Storms could unload damaging wind gusts and perhaps a tornado. Rain will expand east throughout Tuesday and spread into parts of the mid-Atlantic and the Southeast, where it will fall heavily at times. This heavy rainfall is unlikely to result in widespread flooding, but may pond on some roadways or in low-lying areas. Breezy conditions will develop across the East on Tuesday, especially in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. The combination of gusty winds and drenching rain may lead to disruptions in airport operations for large hubs in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, DC. Wintry weather will present another challenge for holiday travelers in parts of the Northeast on Tuesday. Rain will mix with sleet and snow when precipitation begins across the elevated terrain of Pennsylvania Tuesday morning and southern New York by Tuesday afternoon. This wintry mix will expand into parts of Vermont and New Hampshire Tuesday evening and turn mostly to snow in some areas Tuesday night. Accumulating snow Tuesday night will largely be confined to the highest elevations of the Adirondacks and the Green and White mountains. Weather travel disruptions may not be as widespread on Wednesday as the stormslowly tracks off the East Coast and inland impacts start to diminish. Roadways may be slick or snow-covered in parts of New York, Vermont and New Hampshire Wednesday morning following Tuesday night’s wintry weather. More accumulating snow will arrive in Maine on Wednesday as a wintry mix continues across Vermont and New Hampshire. Rain will taper off throughout the day across Pennsylvania, New Jersey and much of New York, but will persist across the Carolinas and parts of the Southeast. For travelers across the West, the weather will be perfect for travel on Tuesday and Wednesday with high pressure in control across almost the entire region. Thanksgiving will be much cooler and largely dry across the central and eastern US as chilly Canadian air settles into place in the wake of the storm. However, this influx of cold air will cause lake-effect snow showers to develop downwind of the Great Lakes. Gas prices are tumbling, just in time for Thanksgiving Dry weather is expected for the annual Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City on Thursday morning, but some breezy conditions may persist. The parade’s famous balloons are typically flown closer to the ground on a breezy day and higher off the ground on a calm day. Elsewhere, a few rain showers may push across coastal Texas while in the West some mountain snow could bring fresh powder to high elevations in the northern Rockies. Weather conditions will generally be calmer for travelers across the eastern half of the US heading home after Thanksgiving festivities on Friday, but the weekend may not be dry. Another storm may develop and move off the East Coast over the weekend. Rain and potential wintry weather is possible across the mid-Atlantic and Northeast.It’s still too early to know exactly how, or even if, this storm develops, but details will come into focus by midweek. Travelers in the West should be treated another stretch of favorable conditions as high pressure remains in place.","['us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",us,True,True

Sunak was joined by ministers, diplomats and philanthropists from about 20 countries at a one-day Global Food Security Summit in London, where he urged world leaders to harness artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technology to end malnutrition around the globe. Sunak told delegates that a “fundamental shift” is needed to confront afood-security crisis that is being worsened by climate change. He focused on the role of science and said the U.K. would set up a “virtual science hub” linking international researchers working on more resilient crops. The U.K. hub will be part of a global research partnership known as CGIAR. “Climate change, conflict and population rise mean ever greater challenges to food supplies,"" Sunak said. “So we need a fundamental shift in the way we approach food security, with a focus on long-term solutions to stop food crises before they start. And we need to harness the full power of science and technology to ensure supplies are resilient to threats like conflict, drought and floods.” The event was co-hosted by Somalia and the United Arab Emirates alongside the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and the Bill&Melinda Gates Foundation. The summit coincided with publication of a “re-energized” U.K. development strategy aimed at ending extreme poverty and tackling climate change and biodiversity loss. The document sets out the U.K.'s aid plans through 2030, and confirms Britain will not restore development aid to 0.7% of gross national income — after it was cut to 0.5% during the coronavirus pandemic — until “the fiscal situation allows.” Instead, the U.K. says it will spend smarter, earmarking money to help countries strengthen their defenses against natural disasters, raising more private-sector money for development and building “mutually respectful” relationships with developing nations. “Today’s answer cannot be about rich countries ‘doing development’ to others,” Foreign Secretary David Cameron wrote in an introduction. “We need to work together as partners, shaping narratives which developing countries own and deliver.” The Lancaster House conference venue was picketed by activists from Medical Aid for Palestinians calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war to get urgently needed food and humanitarian aid into Gaza. “It is good that they are talking about addressing food and security in the world. But if they’re going to do that seriously, they cannot ignore the situation in Gaza, where 2.2 million people are at risk of starvation,” said the group’s chief executive, Melanie Ward. “Because of the siege that’s been imposed on Gaza, the amount of aid that’s gotten in the last month is only enough for about two normal days in Gaza. So less than 10% of the food needed to keep people in Gaza alive is actually getting in.” Like the United States, the U.K. has not called for a cease-fire, but Sunak urged Israel to agree to “urgent and substantive humanitarian pauses” to get in food, fuel and medicine. “The situation on the ground is truly tragic and getting worse,” he said.","['unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'somalia', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'israel', 'israel', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories']",us,True,False

The document sets out the U.K.'s aid plans through 2030, and confirms Britain will not restore development aid to 0.7% of gross national income — after it was cut to 0.5% during the coronavirus pandemic — until “the fiscal situation allows.” Instead, the U.K. says it will spend smarter, earmarking money to help countries strengthen their defenses against natural disasters, raising more private-sector money for development and building “mutually respectful” relationships with developing nations. “Today’s answer cannot be about rich countries ‘doing development’ to others,” Foreign Secretary David Cameron wrote in an introduction. “We need to work together as partners, shaping narratives which developing countries own and deliver.” The Lancaster House conference venue was picketed by activists from Medical Aid for Palestinians calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war to get urgently needed food and humanitarian aid into Gaza. “It is good that they are talking about addressing food and security in the world. But if they’re going to do that seriously, they cannot ignore the situation in Gaza, where 2.2 million people are at risk of starvation,” said the group’s chief executive, Melanie Ward. “Because of the siege that’s been imposed on Gaza, the amount of aid that’s gotten in the last month is only enough for about two normal days in Gaza. So less than 10% of the food needed to keep people in Gaza alive is actually getting in.” Like the United States, the U.K. has not called for a cease-fire, but Sunak urged Israel to agree to “urgent and substantive humanitarian pauses” to get in food, fuel and medicine. “The situation on the ground is truly tragic and getting worse,” he said.","['unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'somalia', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'israel', 'israel', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories']",us,True,False

No incontrovertibl… [+9156 chars]",Education,"Although most Americans today have no living memory ofPresident John F. Kennedy, we are reminded of hisassassinationthis week, as we have been every year since November of 1963. No incontrovertible new evidence about the Kennedy assassination has emerged in six decades. Speculation and conspiracy theories about “what really happened” abound and continue to fascinate. They do so at the expense of what is truly worth remembering and memorializing about Kennedy’s final months as president. In the summer and fall of 1963, Kennedy called upon Americans to address what he described as a “moral crisis” confronting the nation—the continued reality of racial injustice in the United States. The steps he took and the message he conveyed made a deep impression on his fellow citizens. They remind us today of how consequential a President’s words, demeanor, and approach to a riven citizenry can be at difficult turning points in the nation’s history. In 1963, racialsegregationwas still very much alive in the United States despite numerous federal court decisions striking down Jim Crow laws and practices, including the 1954 landmarkBrown v Board of EducationSupreme Court decision. Kennedy, notwithstanding his campaign promises, hadacted only haltingly. Mass protests that spring organized by civil rights activists in Birmingham and other cities dramatically catapulted the struggle against racial injustice onto the national stage. To widespread public horror, local officials in Birmingham had brutally loosed police dogs and fire hoses against demonstrators, including children. Moral outrage did little to quell the continued resistance of ardent segregationists. June brought George Wallace’s infamous “stand in the schoolhouse door” when, in defiance of both a May federal district court desegregation order and the Kennedy Justice Department, Alabama’s Governor sought to prevent the enrollment of Vivian Malone and James Hood, two African American students, at the state university. Even as Wallace was forced to retreat, he vowed to fight further “federal interference” in his state and “the trend toward military dictatorship in this country.” Read More:What These 3 Longstanding JFK Myths Reveal About America On June 11, 1963, the very evening of the showdown with Wallace, President Kennedy delivered a remarkable televised speech on civil rights. It was the first presidential address to the nation explicitly characterizing andcondemning at length segregationas a moral wrong, unworthy of a great country. “One hundred years of delay have passed,” Kennedy reminded the nation, “since PresidentLincolnfreed the slaves, yet their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free. They are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice. They are not yet freed from social and economic oppression. And this Nation, for all its hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully free until all its citizens are free.” Kennedy further promised to introduce a sweeping civil rights bill which would take aim at the heart of Jim Crow. Before Kennedy had even finished speaking, telegrams flooded the White House from citizens moved by his remarks. The sentiments they expressed ranged from outrage to exhilaration. One segregationist mused, “I wish you’d take a night off and go to the theater like Lincoln did and then you wouldn’t have any more problems. Neither would we.” Another critic requested, “Please reconsider and don’t introduce your civil rights legislation in Congress because I may want the privilege of throwing you out of my business one day.” He added, “People are fed up with the K-K-K from Washington – Kennedy - Kennedy + King Klan.” A woman who took pains to identify herself as a mother promised Kennedy that she would pray every night that the President would see the error of his ways. If he did not, she continued, “I pray that the Lord will strike you dead before you can lead this country to destruction by these immature and forced actions.” Many African Americans, whose plight the president’s speech sought to redress, responded with gratitude and admiration. One confessed, “You are fulfilling my hopes and dreams as I knew you would. Being a Negro, I know the embarrassment, frustration, anger and hurt that we as a race must suffer. I am glad to know that there are better days ahead for my children.” “Your speech tonight was a profile in courage,” another woman wrote. “May the infant Jesus sustain you as you go forth to be crucified.” Myrlie Evers, then a young wife and mother, watched Kennedy’s speech in her home in Jackson, Miss., as she waited for her husband Medgar to return home from his duties as the state’s NAACP field secretary. The President’s remarks, she would remember, “moved me and gave me hope and madethe work Medgar was doingseem more important than ever.” Within hours an appalling act of violence took her husband’s life when a Ku Klux Klansman murdered Medgar Evers in his driveway near midnight. Evers’ murder highlighted the real danger faced by movement leaders and the urgency the moment demanded. In the following weeks, activists finalized plans for a March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom to pressure Congress to enact the legislation called for by President Kennedy and to ensure the bill had teeth. As anticipated, Kennedy’s commitment had immediate political repercussions. “This is a civil wrongs bill, not a civil rights bill,” said Senator Richard B. Russell, a Georgia Democrat. Debates over the proposed bill threatened Democratic Party unity in Texas and the president’s hopes for reelection, prompting plans for a multi-city peacekeeping visit to the Lonestar State that November to mend fences. Enthusiastic crowds greeted President and Mrs. Kennedy in San Antonio, Houston, Fort Worth, and Dallas. The tragic end of that journey at Dealey Plaza and the brutal assassination of the nation’s youngest-ever elected president failed to quench the era’s heated rhetoric, and in fact, only seemed to intensify it. Read More:How Robert F. Kennedy Shaped His Brother's Response to Civil Rights After Kennedy’s death, the grief that engulfed the nation prompted a new flood of letters to the White House—this time directed to the president’s widow and children. The arrest and murder of alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald did not allay the soul searching expressed by citizens who worried about the state of their country. Among the messages sent to the White House was an “epitaph” written by Martin Luther King Jr. and published in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference’s newsletter. He lamented, “Our late President was assassinated by a morally inclement climate. It is a climate filled with heavy torrents of false accusation, jostling winds of hatred and raging storms of violence. It is a climate where men cannot disagree without being disagreeable, and where they express dissent through violence and murder.” Another young woman expressed this sentiment more personally: “The reason that all men mourn the death of your husband is because we feel that we have played a part in his murder. We may not have been there, or even known that you were there but we are all responsible because we did not fight with him in everything he stood for, we just sat back and watched. We have wasted a great man. We may not realize that fault now, but in time, history will write its own story on blood filled pages.” As we reflect on the death of President Kennedy, we should recall that amid the turmoil of his times, he found the determination to lead the nation forward despite profound divisions within the country. If lingering questions around the circumstances of his death remain, they should not obscure what we do know from the letters written to Kennedy in the last months of his life and to his widow and children after his death. “A great change is at hand,” he instructed Americans in his civil rights speech—a prospect that inspired hope in many and that would be, in a measure, fulfilled when his successor, Lyndon Johnson, signed theCivil Right Act of 1964nearly eight months after Kennedy’s assassination. Transformational changes, though incomplete, would follow in the ensuing decades even though the promise of racial equality has yet to be achieved. That, as much as any smoking gun evidence that may never materialize, is truly worth remembering this Nov. 22, 2023.

It read, “The discussions covered various critical issues, including the direct health impacts of climate change on children, such as increased physical dangers, waterborne diseases, and malnutrition. The event also shed light on the alarming rate of child displacement due to environmental disasters, with 650,000 children displaced from 2016 to 2021 due to floods. “Nigeria, as the second most vulnerable country worldwide in terms of children’s exposure to climate change, faces severe challenges. Over 110 million Nigerian children are at risk, having confronted the harsh realities of rising temperatures, flooding, drought, and severe storms.” Director General, National Council on Climate Change, Dr Salisu Dahiru, said, “As one of the countries that suffers the greatest exposure to adverse climate impacts, Nigeria’s response to climate change must be swift and holistic, accounting for the needs of vulnerable people, including children and women, at the decision-making level, as well as in the implementation of the National Climate Change Action Plan. “This celebration is a crucial platform for our children, the most affected by climate change, to voice their concerns and experiences.

The president of the Dominican Republic has insisted that climate change must be taken seriously after heavy rains killed at least 21 people and displaced thousands more. More than 13,000 people have had to move to more secure areas after torrential rains over the previous 48 hours flooded homes, caused power outages and damaged bridges and roads, the Caribbean country’s Emergency Operations Center (COE) said on Sunday. At least 21 people have lost their lives, the COE added. The storm’s victims include nine people who died on Saturday after rains caused the wall of a highway tunnel to collapse onto their cars in the capital, Santa Domingo, according to the national police. The water “infiltrated a saturated subsoil” and the foundation of the concrete wall gave way, the Ministry of Public Works said on the following day. An investigation into the incident has been ordered, while the majority of the nation’s 32 provinces remain under an alert designation. Videos on social media showed rushing water dragging cars down streets and flooded buildings. President Luis Abinader said it is the “largest rainfall event ever” in the Dominican Republic’s history. “Those who do not believe in climate change, start believing,” said Abinader, who spoke of “extensive and substantial” damages. Classes have been suspended until Wednesday, Abinader said, “in order to evaluate the schools that may have been affected” and “guarantee the safety of our young people”. The rains, from a tropical depression, are expected to continue across portions of the country for the next 24 hours, the United States embassy said in a weather alert. More than 2,500 people had to be rescued by protection agencies, and some 2,600 homes had been affected by the storm, the COE said. Forty-five communities were without communication as of Sunday afternoon, according to the COE report. At the end of August, the passage of Tropical Storm Franklin through the Dominican Republic killed two people, left one missing, and forced the evacuation of some 3,000 people from areas in dangerous conditions.

The government of the Caribbean country has come under scrutiny, with experts saying they had warned more than 20 years ago about the wall’s failures and lack of effort to fix them. “It has weaknesses in the design,” civil engineer Cristian Rojas told The Associated Press. “No anchors were placed, and that is why the wall collapsed.” Rojas, former president of the Dominican College of Engineers, Architects and Surveyors, said the force of the water in a flooded adjacent avenue, combined with the type of wall that was built, led to the collapse. Dominican geologist Osiris de Léon recalled that the first warnings about the wall were made more than two decades ago. He posted a story from December 1999 on X, formerly known as Twitter, in which El Siglo newspaper quoted the college recommending that the wall be rebuilt because it was cracked and “it can fall and cause a tragic accident.” The collapse occurred Saturday in Santo Domingo when a portion of the wall that runs along the heavily transited 27 of February Avenue fell in one piece, crushing cars and their occupants, authorities said. Among the victims wasPuerto Ricoprosecutor Michael Orozco, his wife, María Nereida Martínez, and his in-laws, according to Javier Rivera, president of the island’s Association of Prosecutors. Martínez was pregnant. “Comrade Orozco was living a wonderful personal moment with his family, and as a young, committed lawyer, a promising future awaited him,” Rivera said. Also killed was Dominican Police Gen. Eduardo Cabrera Castillo, authorities said. Andrés Matos, spokesman for the Ministry of Public Works, rejected accusations that the government did not properly maintain the wall and nearby infrastructure. “These tunnels and overpasses are given permanent maintenance,” Matos told the AP. He attributed the collapse to other causes but declined to provide details. “The ministry is ordering a deep, structuralist investigation, which implies that we should not get ahead of the causes,” he said. The collapse occurred as a tropical disturbance moved through the western Caribbean, battering the Dominican Republic with heavy rains over the weekend. Authorities said at least 24 people died, including those crushed by the wall. The storm tore tin roofs off hundreds of homes and cut off access to nearly a dozen communities, authorities said.

516476,bbc-news,BBC News,https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,Extreme weather 'biggest threat' to UK heritage,The National Trust says climate change-linked extreme weather is now the biggest threat to its sites.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-67432755,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14FC3/production/_131755958_9cb9462c-38bb-4acc-a1ca-725de8e1ceb9.jpg,2023-11-20 00:14:54,"Flooding, wildfires and extreme weather threaten the future of nearly three-quarters of sites managed by the National Trust, a new report says.

The charity says climate change is ""the single biggest threat"" facing its 28,500 historic homes, 250,000 hectares of land and 780 miles of coastline. In Monday's report, the trust called on the UK government to do more to help organisations adapt to climate change. The government said it had a five-year plan to boost the country's resilience. Patrick Begg, the trust's natural resources director, said that climate change demanded ""urgent and unswerving attention"" and presented ""the single biggest threat to the places in our care"". The trust is monitoring the climate change threats posed to its stately homes, museum collections, parks, gardens and land holdings by mapping current extreme weather events, such as downpours, flooding, drought and wildfires. It then uses the data on its 'hazard map' to predict the threats posed to its sites under a ""worst-case scenario"" in which greenhouse gas emissions, which trap heat in the atmosphere, continue at their current rate. The charity says planning for the worst will help it identify vulnerable sites across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and use knowledge gained on the ground by local teams to adapt to the impacts of climate change. When the map was launched in 2021, it estimated that the number of National Trust sites facing a high level of threat from issues such as coastal erosion, extreme heat and flooding could rise from 5% to 17% over the next 40 years. But in Monday's report - ""A Climate for Change"" - the trust now estimates that 71% of its sites could be at medium or high risk of being impacted by climate change-related extreme weather events by 2060. In response, the conservation body is ramping up its work on climate adaptation, spending millions to repair and protect some sites but also having to decide where money could be better spent. One of those sites where the trust is looking at new ways of working is Mullion Cove Harbour in Cornwall. Nestled between steep cliffs and built in the 1890s, the harbour's two breakwaters are being hit by frequent and violent storms. That has left the trust needing to spend more than £2m on repairing them - with more than 80% of that spent since 1995. It's a cost that might not be worth continuing to pay in the face of rising sea levels and the trust may decide not to carry on with major repairs to one of the two breakwaters. Catherine Lee, community manager for the National Trust on the Lizard Peninsula, told the BBC: ""We've reached the threshold where we feel very strongly that it's unviable to repair the southern breakwater like-for-like. ""That's a really tough call - the National Trust is about looking after special places forever. But what we know is that we can't continue this battle against climate change. We have to adapt to climate change."" The trust is focusing its efforts on the western breakwater, working closely with local volunteers on day-to-day repairs. One of those volunteers is third-generation fisherman Jonny Pascoe, who is also chairman of the Mullion Cove Harbour Society. ""My dad and grandfather worked here so it's a very special place to me. I like to think I'm keeping that heritage going and being part of that rich history,"" he said. Mr Pascoe said ""hard discussions"" had to be had with the trust about what could be saved, and how. ""We can't afford to procrastinate. The climate change situation is not going to allow us to. The sea is certainly not going to allow us to,"" he explained. When it comes to the trust's historic buildings and stately homes, protecting them from extreme weather isn't cheap. The Tudor mansion Coughton Court in Warwickshire is currently undergoing a £3.3m facelift to make sure its roof and gutters can cope with heavy rainfall. Already, staff at the country house have had to rescue collections of historic paintings and chandeliers, which had been leaked on. In other locations, extreme weather has already seen the trust accept climate adaptation will sometimes mean letting things go. At the Iron Age hill fort Dinas Dinlle on Wales' Gwynedd coast, erosion made worse by heavy rainfall in recent years is destroying the site, with many parts already lost to the sea. But its story and history is being recorded - digital 3D modelling is being used to keep a record of the site before it disappears. The work is being carried out with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales and Aberystwyth University. Three years of work at the site has shown that increasingly heavy rainfall is having a significant impact on the ongoing erosion of the hill fort. Professor Sarah Davies, from Aberystwyth University, said the 3D modelling and geophysical studies of the area would help them ""understand more about the hills, the landscape around it and the rates of change before that information is lost"". The National Trust is now calling for more funding and support from government for landowners, heritage organisations and tourism groups across England, Wales and Northern Ireland to help them adapt their buildings, coastlines and countryside to better cope with the impacts of climate change It also wants to see the UK government establish a new Climate Resilience Bill to create national targets for adaptation and a statutory duty on all public bodies to make adaptation a key factor in decision-making. The UK government said it had a national adaptation programme that does set out a five-year plan to increase the country's resilience to climate change risks, including those posed to heritage sites and its coastline and countryside. It added that it had committed to investing billions of pounds in wider climate change adaptation measures, including £5.2bn on flood and coastal schemes in England. A Welsh government spokesperson said it took climate adaptation ""extremely seriously"" and would be publishing a new national strategy towards the end of next year. A spokesperson for Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) said it welcomed the trust's report and said it would also be publishing a new climate change adaptation programme in late 2024.","['uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom']",gb,True,True

In a unique study covering 49 deltas globally, researchers from Lund University and Utrecht University have identified the most critical risks to deltas in the future. The research shows that deltas face multiple risks, and that population growth and poor environmental governance might pose bigger threats than climate change to the sustainability of Asian and African deltas, in particular.""We can clearly show that many risks are not linked to climate. Whileclimate changeis a global problem, other important risk factors like land subsidence, population density and ineffective governance are local problems. Risks to deltas will only increase over time, so now is the time for governments to take action,"" says Murray Scown, associate senior lecturer, Lund University Center for Sustainability Studies, and lead author.Collapse of delta environments could have huge consequences for global sustainable development. In theworst-case scenario, deltas could be lost to the sea; other consequences are flooding, salinization of water, which affects agriculture, coastal squeeze, and loss of ecosystems.The study,published inGlobal Environmental Change, looked at five different IPCC scenarios forglobal developmentin 49 deltas all over the world, including famous deltas such as the Nile, Mekong, and Mississippi, but also more understudied deltas such as the Volta, Zambezi and Irrawaddy deltas.The research identifies possible risks to deltas stretching 80 years into the future. The researchers based their analysis on 13 well-known factors affecting risk in deltas and drew upon unique models to identify which of these risks are most likely to endanger different deltas in the future. Risk factors include increasing population density,urban development, irrigated agriculture, changes to river discharge, land subsidence and relative sea-level rise, limited economic capacity, poor government effectiveness, and low adaptation readiness.Credit: Lund UniversityPopulation density, land subsidence and ineffective governance are high-risk factorsThe analysis shows that there are some risks that are more critical to deltas than others—in all of the five future scenarios. These include land subsidence and relative sea-level rise, population density, ineffective governance, economic capacity, and cropland use.For some deltas, physical risks are especially pronounced. Land subsidence is, for example, the highest risk factor for the Mekong delta in Vietnam. Extreme sea levels are among the most concerningrisk factorsfor deltas in China, on the Korean peninsula, and in the Colorado (Mexico) and Rhine (Netherlands) deltas.In the Nile (Egypt), Niger (Nigeria), and the Ganges (Bangladesh) deltas, it is increasing population density that is of most concern under certain scenarios. For other deltas, it is the lack of economic capacity and government effectiveness to manage risks, for example in the Irrawaddy (Myanmar) and Congo (Angola and Democratic Republic of the Congo) deltas.""Analyzed all together, we can see that the Asian mega-deltas are at greatest risk, with potentially devastating consequences for millions of people, and for the environment. They are under pressure frompopulation growth, intense agricultural land use, relative sea-level rise, and lagging adaptation readiness,"" says Murray Scown.Local and global approaches and a mixture of hard and soft adaptation can mitigate risks""Instead of sitting back, governments need to think long-term, and put plans in place to reduce or mitigate risks. In the Mekong delta, for example, the Vietnamese government is making strong efforts to restrict future groundwater extraction in the delta to reduceland subsidenceand salinization,"" says Philip Minderhoud, assistant professor at Wageningen University and Research.The researchers highlight that a mixture of hard (""gray"") and soft (""green"") adaptation approaches will be required to manage and mitigate delta risks. They include both hard infrastructures, like sea walls to stop the sea inundating the delta, and soft approaches using nature-based solutions.One example is the Dutch experience of creating room for the river in the Rhine delta, by lowering floodplains, relocating levees, and using spaces that are allowed to flood for grazing. Initiatives to build up delta surfaces by allowing rivers to flood and deposit sediment on the delta to maintain elevation above sea level are also promising, notes Frances Dunn, assistant professor at Utrecht University.""By looking at the deltas together, like we have in this study, we want to highlight what can happen on a global scale if we do not address delta risk both on a local and global level. The study can also complement studies on individual deltas, and identify efforts needed [that are] connected to less studieddeltassuch as the Saõ Francisco or Volta delta,"" says Maria Santos, professor at the University of Zurich.","['laos', 'laos', 'laos', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'ghana', 'zimbabwe', 'myanmar', 'myanmar', 'vietnam', 'china', 'mexico', 'germany', 'netherlands', 'egypt', 'bangladesh', 'congo', 'congo', 'angola', 'democraticrepublicofthecongo']",gb,False,False

Sunak was joined by ministers, diplomats and philanthropists from about 20 countries at a one-day Global Food Security Summit in London, where he urged world leaders to harness artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technology to end malnutrition around the globe. Sunak told delegates that a “fundamental shift” is needed to confront afood-security crisis that is being worsened by climate change. He focused on the role of science and said the U.K. would set up a “virtual science hub” linking international researchers working on more resilient crops. The U.K. hub will be part of a global research partnership known as CGIAR. “Climate change, conflict and population rise mean ever greater challenges to food supplies,"" Sunak said. “So we need a fundamental shift in the way we approach food security, with a focus on long-term solutions to stop food crises before they start. And we need to harness the full power of science and technology to ensure supplies are resilient to threats like conflict, drought and floods.” The event was co-hosted by Somalia and the United Arab Emirates alongside the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and the Bill&Melinda Gates Foundation. The summit coincided with publication of a “re-energized” U.K. development strategy aimed at ending extreme poverty and tackling climate change and biodiversity loss. The document sets out the U.K.'s aid plans through 2030, and confirms Britain will not restore development aid to 0.7% of gross national income — after it was cut to 0.5% during the coronavirus pandemic — until “the fiscal situation allows.” Instead, the U.K. says it will spend smarter, earmarking money to help countries strengthen their defenses against natural disasters, raising more private-sector money for development and building “mutually respectful” relationships with developing nations. “Today’s answer cannot be about rich countries ‘doing development’ to others,” Foreign Secretary David Cameron wrote in an introduction. “We need to work together as partners, shaping narratives which developing countries own and deliver.” The Lancaster House conference venue was picketed by activists from Medical Aid for Palestinians calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war to get urgently needed food and humanitarian aid into Gaza. “It is good that they are talking about addressing food and security in the world. But if they’re going to do that seriously, they cannot ignore the situation in Gaza, where 2.2 million people are at risk of starvation,” said the group’s chief executive, Melanie Ward. “Because of the siege that’s been imposed on Gaza, the amount of aid that’s gotten in the last month is only enough for about two normal days in Gaza. So less than 10% of the food needed to keep people in Gaza alive is actually getting in.” Like the United States, the U.K. has not called for a cease-fire, but Sunak urged Israel to agree to “urgent and substantive humanitarian pauses” to get in food, fuel and medicine. “The situation on the ground is truly tragic and getting worse,” he said.","['unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'uk', 'somalia', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'israel', 'israel', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories']",us,True,False

The work identifies which organizations hold the greatest potential. Discover their capabilities, progress, and commercial prospects, helping you stay ahead.Surging Demand for Crude Oil Amidst Depleting Reserves Is Driving the Market GrowthAs conventional oil reserves deplete, the global demand for crude oil remains unabated. Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) techniques, including polymer flooding and surfactant-polymer flooding, have become pivotal in extracting additional oil from mature fields. This demand is prominent in regions like the Middle East, where countries like Saudi Arabia and Iraq extensively employ chemical EOR methods to sustain oil production levels. The technique ensures a continued supply of oil by recovering otherwise unrecoverable reserves, thus driving the chemical EOR market.The Fluctuation of Oil Prices Hinders the Growth of the MarketThe Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) market, like many sectors within the energy industry, is significantly impacted by the fluctuation of oil prices. These price fluctuations have a profound influence on the market's growth and development. When oil prices experience volatility, it creates a climate of uncertainty within the energy sector. Oil companies and operators must carefully assess the economic viability of their EOR projects, as the cost-effectiveness of implementing chemical EOR methods can be directly tied to prevailing oil prices. During periods of low oil prices, the financial feasibility of EOR initiatives may come into question, as the expenses associated with chemical formulations and injection processes may outweigh the benefits of increased oil recovery.

Insurers can encourage eco-friendly building practices, energy-efficient upgrades, and sustainable materials by offering coverage incentives. These factors align with the growing focus on environmental sustainability and eco-conscious homeowners. Additionally, blockchain technology can enhance transparency, reduce fraud, and streamline the management of insurance policies, particularly in property transactions and ownership transfers. As more individuals run businesses from their homes, insurers can offer specialized coverage tailored to the unique risks faced by home-based businesses, including protection against cyber threats, liability, and business interruption. Furthermore, pay-as-you-go insurance allows homeowners to pay premiums based on usage and risk factors. It can encourage safer behaviour and cost savings for responsible homeowners. Besides, the parametric insurance approach involves pre-defined triggers that automatically pay when specific conditions are met, such as wind speeds during a hurricane. It can provide faster, more transparent claims processing for natural disasters. Request to Download Sample Research Report -https://www.thebrainyinsights.com/enquiry/sample-request/13798 Report Coverage Details Key Insight of the global Home Insurance market Asia Pacific is expected to witness the highest market growth over the forecast period. The Asia Pacific region has experienced significant economic growth over the past few decades, leading to a growing middle class with rising disposable incomes. As people achieve a higher standard of living and homeownership becomes more attainable, the demand for home insurance has steadily increased. Additionally, the Asia Pacific region is the most populous in the world, and with a growing population, there is an increased need for housing and insurance. This demographic shift drives the demand for home insurance. The Asia Pacific region is also susceptible to various natural disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons, and flooding. These risks make homeowners keenly aware of the need for insurance coverage to protect their homes and possessions. As the cost of home insurance becomes more affordable and accessible, many households in the Asia Pacific region prefer to purchase policies, further boosting the market's growth. Besides, some regional governments are promoting homeownership and risk mitigation through initiatives that offer incentives for purchasing home insurance, especially in areas prone to natural disasters. In 2022, the dwelling coverage segment dominated the market with the largest share of 38.61% and revenue of 100.29 billion. The coverage segment includes content coverage, comprehensive coverage, dwelling coverage and other optional coverages. In 2022, the landlords segment dominated the market with the highest share of 68.72% and market revenue of 178.50 billion. The end user form segment is classified into landlords and tenants. Advancement in market In February 2023: Allianz's Direct Home and Landlord insurance offerings have been extended to encompass additional regions in northern Queensland and Western Australia. This expansion comes from the company's decision to participate in the cyclone reinsurance pool, which is backed by the Federal Government, effective from January 1, 2023. With this expansion, many policyholders residing in high-cyclone risk areas in Northern Australia will experience the advantage of reduced premiums for their home and contents insurance. Procure Complete Research Report -https://www.thebrainyinsights.com/report/home-insurance-market-13798 Market Dynamics Driver: Legislative and regulatory changes. Changes in government regulations, particularly those related to building codes and insurance requirements, can have a significant impact on the home insurance market. These regulations are often introduced or modified in response to evolving risks, safety considerations, and the need to protect homeowners and insurers. One common example is the effect of stricter regulations in flood-prone areas. Government authorities regularly update building codes and construction standards to enhance the resilience of homes against natural disasters and other risks. Stricter building codes may require homes in certain areas to be built to withstand hurricanes, earthquakes, or other local hazards. In addition, stricter building codes can lead to safer and more resilient homes, which may result in fewer claims for insurers. This factor can positively impact the pricing and availability of home insurance in compliance with the new codes. Furthermore, government regulations that reinforce mortgage insurance requirements are critical in driving demand for home insurance. These requirements make it a standard practice for homeowners to purchase and maintain insurance coverage. Restraint: Lack of consumer awareness. Homeowners may need to appreciate the potential risks their homes face fully. This lack of awareness can lead to underestimating the importance of home insurance. They might assume that disasters or accidents are unlikely to affect them personally. In addition, some homeowners may need more financial literacy or a clear understanding of insurance. They need to grasp the financial impact of unexpected events, which can result in inadequate coverage or opting for the minimum required coverage. In regions with a history of stability and low incidence of disasters, homeowners may become complacent and assume they are immune to risks. This complacency can lead to paying attention to the need for comprehensive insurance coverage. Some homeowners may mistakenly believe that government assistance will fully cover losses in the event of a disaster. While government aid is available in certain cases, it is often limited and may only cover some expenses. Furthermore, home insurance policies can be complex, with different components for dwelling coverage, personal property, liability, and additional living expenses. Homeowners may need to understand what each component covers fully and pay more attention to their need for specific types of coverage. This lack of awareness can present challenges and hamper the growth of the home insurance market. Opportunity: Data analytics and risk assessment. Advanced data analytics enables insurers to collect, analyze, and interpret vast amounts of data from various sources. This data encompasses historical loss data, environmental factors, property attributes, claims history, and others. Insurers can use this information to gain a thorough understanding of the threats associated with insuring a particular property or area. In addition, with advanced data analytics, underwriters can make informed decisions by leveraging real-time and historical data to assess risk factors comprehensively. This factor leads to more efficient underwriting processes and allows underwriters to tailor coverage and pricing to meet specific risk profiles. Furthermore, geographic information systems (GIS) and geospatial data are integral to risk assessment. Advanced analytics can harness geospatial information to identify high-risk areas for perils such as flooding, wildfires, or crime. This factor enables insurers to offer coverage tailored to specific locations and risk levels. Challenge: Claims processing efficiency. Timely and efficient claims processing is vital for customer satisfaction. When policyholders experience a loss, they rely on their insurance provider to assist them promptly. Delays or cumbersome procedures can lead to frustration, erode trust, and tarnish the insurer's reputation. Efficient claims processing fosters trust and loyalty among policyholders. When insurers promptly and fairly settle claims, it reinforces the perception that policyholders are in good hands. This factor, in turn, encourages long-term relationships and customer retention. Additionally, an insurer's reputation is closely tied to its claims-handling capabilities. Negative experiences with claims can quickly spread through word-of-mouth, social media, and online reviews, potentially harming the company's image. Efficient claims processing helps protect and enhance the insurer's reputation. Furthermore, streamlining claims processing can be a significant competitive advantage. Insurers who excel in this area are more likely to draw the attention of new customers and retain existing ones. Customers often prioritize ease and speed of claims resolution when choosing an insurance provider. Interested to Procure the Research Report?

He said rescue crews were on standby waiting for the weather conditions to ease to begin a rescue mission. “Unfortunately, we could not carry out search-and-rescue activities for the 12 Turkish crew members,” Yerlikaya said. “As soon as conditions improve the search-and-rescue operations will begin immediately.” The severe storms that hit northwestern Turkey caused widespread damage and disruption on Sunday, including the breakup of another cargo ship and the evacuation of a prison.

All 13 crew were rescued safely. Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said prisoners had been transferred from Eregli’s prison to surrounding facilities due to rising water levels.

Raman lost more than Rs.20 lakh on Diwali night. A misdirected sky-shot cracker landed inside his eighth floor apartment and started a blaze that destroyed the furniture, gadgets and clothing. Fortunately, Raman and his family were out, so there were no casualties, but many valuables were reduced to ashes. Though it won’t lessen the emotional distress of losing one’s belongings and seeing one’s house covered in soot, a basic home insurance policy can cover the financial loss . Home insurance is as cheap as it is necessary. The annual premium of covering a house and its contents for Rs.20 lakh is only Rs.900-1,200 ( see graphic ). The cost is minuscule compared to the coverage it offers. Broken down to daily cost, it is less than half of what you pay for a cup of tea at a roadside vendor . GAURAV ARORA CHIEF, UNDERWRITING & CLAIMS, PROPERTY & CASUALTY, ICICI LOMBARD GENERAL INSURANCE “People invest their life savings in a house, but don’t do enough to protect this asset. A big chunk of the net worth is exposed to risk.” Yet, barely one in 20 homeowners purchases this cover. For an average person, his house is the biggest financial investment. “People invest their life savings in building a house, but don’t do enough to safeguard this investment,” says Gaurav Arora, Chief of Underwriting & Claims, Property & Casualty, ICICI Lombard General Insurance. “We have a very optimistic outlook and believe that disasters happen only to other people,” says Vivek Chaturvedi, CMO and Head of Direct Sales, Digit General Insurance. “The frequency of disasters may be low, but the severity of loss when the disaster strikes is very high,” he adds. You Might Also Like: What a home insurance policy will not cover Buyers nudged by nature Perhaps the most effective salesperson for home insurance is nature itself. Every time there is a natural disaster, home insurance sales pick up. In August 2018, floods wreaked havoc in Kerala. The following year, the fire and allied perils segment witnessed a 34% jump in premium income as homeowners rushed to cover their houses and valuables. In May 2020, cyclone Amphan hit West Bengal and premium income shot up 27% in 2020-21 (see graphic ). However, public memory is short, and once the memories of disaster recede, home insurance is relegated to the backseat again. “We saw a parallel in health insurance recently. When Covid struck and medical bills shot to stratospheric levels, there was a massive surge in the purchase of health insurance. Now that the threat has gone away, health insurance is back to normal levels,” says Chaturvedi of Digit General Insurance. GURDEEP SINGH BATRA HEAD OF PROPERTY UNDERWRITING, BAJAJ ALLIANZ GENERAL INSURANCE “Flat owners need not depend on home insurance taken by the housing society. They can buy an additional cover for their unit and its contents.” Devastating earthquakes, cyclones and floods are not the only risks that your house is exposed to. The mushrooming of high-rise buildings and growing use of gadgets and appliances have increased the risk of fires. According to one estimate, Mumbai witnesses more than 5,000 fire incidents every year, and 70% of these are caused by electricity. Both Delhi and Bengaluru record about 2,500 fire incidents in a year. “Fire incidents are on the rise because the use of electrical and electronic gadgets has increased the load on electrical wiring, especially in high-rise buildings,” says Arora of ICICI Lombard General Insurance. In many cases, the fire may not even start, but the interiors may still get damaged. Chaturvedi of points out that once a fire alarm gets activated, water pressure from the sprinkler system often damages the interiors. The electronic gadgets in the house will also get damaged due to water. Unless the contents are insured against damage, the owner will suffer a loss even if there is no fire. Some people have this misconception that if they live in a rented house, they don’t need home insurance. Any damage to the house will, of course, be the landlord’s headache, but what about the contents? You also need insurance against any damage to the contents (by natural or man-made disaster), and against burglary. Essential covers for your house If we have convinced you to buy home insurance, here are the things you need to consider. Buy a policy that fits your needs. Three years ago, the insurance regulator made it mandatory for general insurers to offer a standard home insurance policy. The Bharat Griha Raksha (BGR) policy offered by all insurers covers damage to the house by natural calamities, fire, explosion or even external forces, such as a tree falling or a vehicle crashing into the wall. It also covers many associated costs of damage, such as removal of debris and fees of the architect or consulting engineer. Though this policy offers comprehensive insurance, the standard BGR has its limitations. The policy covers contents up to Rs.10 lakh or 20% of the cover, whichever is lower. A cover of Rs.10 lakh may not sufficiently cover the contents of the average middle class home. “If you have highvalue items in your house, you should consider buying an additional cover for the contents,” says Gurdeep Singh Batra, Head of Property Underwriting, Risk Engg, Global Accounts and Coinsurance, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. The BGR offers an additional cover for valuable contents on an agreed value basis, where the value is determined by mutual agreement. “One can also buy breakdown cover for gadgets and appliances,” says Tarun Mathur, CBO, General Insurance & Co-founder, Policybazaar.com. Don’t undervalue While buying home insurance, make sure you have sufficient cover. Yes, you need to insure only the value of the structure, not the cost of the property, but make sure you have calculated the reconstruction cost correctly. “Home insurance buyers often make the mistake of linking the cover to the loan taken for the property,” says Batra of Bajaj Allianz general Insurance. The cost of reconstructing a basic quality structure is only Rs.1,200-1,500 per square foot. But if your house has premium fittings and a lot of branded stuff, the cost will be much higher at Rs.3,500-4,000 per square foot (see graphic). Buy adequate cover for your house. SRABASTI DHALI VICE-PRESIDENT & NATIONAL MANAGER, PCG & HOME, TATA AIG GENERAL INSURANCE “A multi-year plan saves one the trouble of annual renewals, locks future premiums and hikes the cover by 10% every year.” The other common mistake is that buyers don’t review coverage when the policy comes up for renewal. Inflation will push up the cost of construction every year, so you need to increase the cover accordingly. One way to do this is by taking a multi-year policy. Such policies increase the base cover by 10% every year to offset the impact of inflation. “A multi-year policy saves the buyer the trouble of renewing it every year, locks in the premium amount for the future, and even takes care of inflation by way of 10% annual increase in home building cover,” says Srabasti Dhali, Vice-President & National Manager, PCG & Home, TATA AIG General Insurance. Valuation of contents The valuation of contents is critical. Start by making an inventory of the items you want to cover, mentioning the item, the year of purchase, model and machine number, and its value. Keep in mind that insurance companies value appliances, gadgets and other items using the standard depreciation formula. The value of the item keeps reducing over the years. So an electronic item bought for Rs.50,000 two years ago will now be worth only Rs.20,000-22,000. It’s important to revisit this list every year when the policy comes up for renewal. You may have discarded some items in the list or added new ones. Make sure to notify the company for any additional item and furnish all the required details. If the overall value of the contents is within the insurance cover opted for, there won’t be any change in premium. This is why it is advisable to use the services of an insurance agent so that there is no discrepancy. If you want to insure some art or artefacts, you will need a valuation certificate from a certified agency. This requirement is waived if the item is worth less than Rs.1 lakh and the total value of such items does not exceed Rs.5 lakh. VIVEK CHATURVEDI CMO AND HEAD OF DIRECT SALES, DIGIT GENERAL INSURANCE “We tend to believe disasters happen only to other people. The frequency of disasters may be low, but the severity of loss is very high.” How much does it cost? The essential insurance that your house needs is very cheap. ESSEN TIAL COVERS Damage to building The basic home insurance that everybody needs. It covers the structure for damage by natural calamities, such as earthquake, lightning, storms and floods, and man-made perils, such as fire, vandalism and riots. The policy pays for repairs and reconstruction of the damaged property. Cost of cover: Rs.15-30 per Rs.1 lakh Damage to contents Apart from the building, you can also cover the contents against these perils. The premium is slightly higher for this coverage, though some companies charge the same rate for both the building and contents. Cost of cover: Rs.30-50 per Rs.1 lakh Burglary or theft The house contents also need to be insured against burglary or theft. The items to be covered (furniture, artefacts, clothing, appliances, gadgets) are specified and insured for an agreed value determined by the customer and insurance company. Cost of cover: Rs.125-200 per Rs.1 lakh GOOD TO HAVE COVERS Breakdown of gadgets Gadgets in the house can also be covered against breakdown. Here, again, the items have to be listed and insured for an agreed value determined by the customer and insurance company. Cost of cover : Rs.200-300 per Rs.1 lakh EMI protection If the houseowner had taken a loan for the damaged property, he can buy protection against EMI payments. The insurance company pays the EMIs for a specified period when the damaged house is being repaired or reconstructed. Cost of cover: Rs.2,500 for six months’ EMIs Alternative accommodation If the house is damaged, a tenant will have to take up alternative accommodation. If the rent for this is higher than that being paid by him for the damaged house, the insurance company will pay the difference for the period specified in the policy. Cost of cover: Rs.2,500 for six months’ rent Loss of rent If the damage to house makes it unlivable, the owner will suffer loss of rent. Houseowners can safeguard themselves against this loss with an add-on cover that pays rent for a chosen period. Cost of cover: Rs.2,000 for a rent of Rs.25,000 per month for six months AVOIDABLE COVERS Personal accident Houseowners can bundle in a personal accident cover with their home insurance policy. This cover is very cheap, though the insured amount is not very high. Cost of cover: Rs.300 for Rs.5 lakh Baggage loss Another add-on cover is for loss of baggage during travel. This cover may not be very useful. In any case, a travel policy taken by the individual will also offer baggage cover. Cost of cover: Rs.250 for baggage worth Rs.50,000 HOW TO BRING DOWN HOME INSURANCE COST Worried by the cost of home insurance? Here are ways to reduce the premium. AGREE TO PAY : If you agree to pay a minimum amount for the repair of your house and contents, the premium is reduced. However, not all companies offer this option. BE SELECTIVE: Don't insure all items in the house. Very old items, with low depreciated values, should be kept out of the list. ENHANCE COVERAGE: Some companies offer discounts if you take 2-3 add-on covers. This may not bring down the premium, but will enhance your coverage. INVEST IN SAFETY: If you install safety measures, such as fire safety alarms and fire-fighting equipment, you can get discounts ranging from 10-15%. CLAIM TAX BENEFITS: If you are a self-employed professional or businessman, you can claim deduction for the amount spent on home insurance. This benefit is not available to salaried people. BUY MULTI-YEAR PLAN: A multi-year plan will increase the cover by 10% every year. This will not bring down the cost per se, but will enhance your cover at no extra cost.

Pathak, 44, migrated from his village in eastern Bihar state over two decades ago to work in the big city on the other side of the country, hoping to supplement his family's income reliant on wheat and rice from their 1.5-acre (0.6-hectare) farm. His decision to leave paid off. Pathak's steady salary from the city job kept his family afloat even as crop yields dropped consistently due to the droughts and floods ravaging his farm. ""It either doesn't rain or it rains so much that it floods. We get just one yield every year. It wasn't like this when I was growing up,"" Pathak told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Now he leases his field to villagers who share half of any profit with him. But he would like to go back to his land if a push towards eco-friendly agriculture helps farmers cope with worsening climate pressures and pays off financially. Agriculture is India's biggest employer, supporting the livelihoods of 250 million farmers and informal labourers - but their work is getting harder as climate change makes living off farming difficult, pushing up debt, migration and suicides. Worries over falling yields have driven up the use of chemical fertilisers that are stripping the soil of nutrients and fuelling agricultural emissions on a warming planet. In response, green farming projects have taken root in India, where staple crops include rice, wheat, maize, sugarcane, cotton and groundnut. But experts say the scale and success hinges on how well the approach protects poor farmers' incomes. ""If you want to sustain agriculture as the biggest employer, and want to bring in sustainable farming, first bring living income to farmers,"" said Devinder Sharma, an independent expert on agricultural policy. ""As a nation, we need to move towards agro-ecology but these (sustainable farming projects) will only bring about cosmetic changes until you provide farmers an assured income,"" he added. A government-backed guaranteed price for natural produce, subsidies to cover losses and stronger marketing channels would all help, he said. A TALE OF TWO FARMERS Worldwide, rice is a staple food for more than 3 billion people while flooded paddy fields account for 12% of humanity's methane emissions - equivalent to 1.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions - according to the Asian Development Bank. Asia-Pacific accounts for the highest emissions from agriculture, partly because of the region's rising use of synthetic fertilisers in rice cultivation, the bank says. Farmers' incomes in India, the second-largest producer of rice globally after China, are wedded to paddy yields. That makes them reluctant to shift away from conventional methods of pumping fertilisers onto fields to raise production. But farmer Jitendra Singh in northern India has made the switch from high fertiliser use, incentivised by the prospect of extra income from generating carbon credits through lower-emitting methods, which can be traded on international markets. He no longer transplants paddy seedlings into flooded fields, but directly sows them into the soil. Besides reducing methane emissions, that has cut water use, time needed for sowing and the use of chemical herbicides and fertilisers. On a rice farm in eastern Odisha state, however, Gurcharan Mahanta seems uninterested in a regional project to promote millet, a long-forgotten crop making a comeback because it is resilient to droughts fuelled by climate change. Mahanta, 54, said his high-yielding hybrid rice variety fetched him a good price, which millet would not with a small consumer base. Growing paddy is also less labour-intensive. ""I go by the market demand,"" he said. FINANCIAL PROBLEMS CURB GREEN SHIFT More than 80% of farmers in India own less than five acres - and many keep spending on fertilisers and pesticides, hoping for good yields even though they face a crushing burden of debt. Nearly 11,000 farmers, cultivators and agricultural labourers took their own lives in 2021, averaging about 30 deaths a day, with bankruptcy the leading cause, according to government data. In a bid to support these smallholders and make farming more climate-friendly, India is promoting organic and natural farming, encouraging diversification to cut dependence on one major crop and incentivising solar-powered water pumps for irrigation to reduce the use of fossil fuel power. At a meeting of G20 agriculture ministers this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the disproportionate impact of climate change on agriculture in the Global South and said Indian farmers are taking up natural farming to revive the soil. ""Our policy is a fusion of back to basics and march to the future. We are promoting natural farming as well as technology-enabled farming,"" he said in a speech. Yet agricultural scientists estimate that fewer than 5% of Indian farmers have switched to sustainable farming methods, even though many are aware of the threat of global warming and the rising costs of conventional practices. ""Farmers understand climate change. They worry about rain and droughts. But they will not understand sustainable agriculture until their problems are first understood,"" said Vikram Singh, joint secretary of the All India Agricultural Workers' Union. TRADITIONAL TIES TO THE LAND Despite the challenges, sustainable farming has brought some success stories, including young people who have given up city careers in tech or pharmaceuticals to return to family farms. But the wins are patchy - and, in some cases, the eco-friendly switch has added to farmers' stress. In the southern Indian state of Telangana, for instance, millers are turning away from genetically modified BT cotton in response to rising global demand for sustainable organic cotton. But organic seeds are rare in India where BT dominates and cotton-processing infrastructure is designed for large volumes. Addressing issues like these - and ensuring that sustainable methods boost crop yields and incomes - will be key to bringing would-be farmers like Pathak back to the land they love. Wrapping up his day driving through the manic Mumbai traffic, Pathak said he pined for the clean air of his village, his jute bed and the farm-fresh gooseberries he enjoys on his annual vacation back home. He hopes to return to that traditional rural life if the economics stack up and local markets for naturally grown produce thrive. He suggested farmers could find other income sources too like selling milk to dairies with village networks, helping them earn between harvests and protecting them from climate extremes. Shiraz Wajih, president of the nonprofit Gorakhpur Environmental Action Group, urged farmers and agricultural scientists to work together to create solutions on the ground. Local production of inputs for natural farming can cut costs and dependence on outside markets while creating jobs, he said. And fine-tuning farm processes suited to each region's ecology would boost acceptance of greener methods, he added. Wajih said most farmers do not want to leave their land, as seen during COVID-19 lockdowns when migrant factory workers returned to their farms to keep them going in tough times. ""People are aware of job options that can pay them better. But land is always the permanent address of farmers,"" he said.

Sunak was joined by ministers, diplomats and philanthropists from about 20 countries at a one-day Global Food Security Summit in London, where he urged world leaders to harness artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technology to end malnutrition around the globe. Sunak told delegates that a ""fundamental shift"" is needed to confront a food-security crisis that is being worsened by climate change. He focused on the role of science and said the UK would set up a ""virtual science hub"" linking international researchers working on more resilient crops. The UK hub will be part of a global research partnership known as CGIAR. ""Climate change, conflict and population rise mean ever greater challenges to food supplies,"" Sunak said. ""So we need a fundamental shift in the way we approach food security, with a focus on long-term solutions to stop food crises before they start. And we need to harness the full power of science and technology to ensure supplies are resilient to threats like conflict, drought and floods."" The event was co-hosted by Somalia and the United Arab Emirates alongside the Children's Investment Fund Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The conference venue was picketed by activists from Medical Aid for Palestinians calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war to get urgently needed food and humanitarian aid into Gaza. ""It is good that they are talking about addressing food and security in the world. But if they're going to do that seriously, they cannot ignore the situation in Gaza, where 2.2 million people are at risk of starvation,"" said the group's chief executive, Melanie Ward. ""Because of the siege that's been imposed on Gaza, the amount of aid that's gotten in the last month is only enough for about two normal days in Gaza. So less than 10% of the food needed to keep people in Gaza alive is actually getting in."" Like the United States, the UK has not called for a cease-fire, but Sunak urged Israel to agree to ""urgent and substantive humanitarian pauses"" to get in food, fuel and medicine.

Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here. Moving is never easy — and it’s even harder in the era of global warming. Beyond the usual concerns like jobs, affordability, and proximity to family and friends, people are now considering rising seas, wildfire smoke, and heat waves. According to a recent survey, nearly a third of Americans named climate change as a motivation to move. Some are headed to “climate havens,” the places experts say will be relatively pleasant to live in as the world heats up, like Duluth, Minnesota; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and Burlington, Vermont. Researchers have pointed to the Great Lakes region, and Michigan in particular, as a destination for people seeking to escape the storm-ravaged Southeast or the parched Southwest. The Midwest holds special appeal with its abundant fresh water, cooler summers, and comparatively little risk from hurricanes and wildfires. But as the federal government’s comprehensive Fifth National Climate Assessment detailed last week, there’s nowhere you can truly hide from climate change. This summer, historic wildfires in Canada sent unhealthy smoke swirling into the Midwest and Northeast, bringing apocalyptic skies from Minneapolis to Buffalo, New York, and all the supposed refuges in between. Heavy rain in July caused devastating flash floods in Vermont. Three years earlier, a ProPublica analysis had identified the hardest-hit place in the state, Lamoille County, as the safest county in the U.S. “It’s time to put the idea of climate safe havens to rest,” the climate news site Heatmap declared this summer. Still, the new assessment demonstrates that some places are safer than others. The report says that moving away from more dangerous spots to less precarious ones is a solution that’s already happening — not only in coastal areas in the Southeast, but also in flood zones in the Midwest. The assessment also makes it clear that vulnerability is often created by city planning choices. Climate havens may not be something nature hands us, but something we have to build ourselves. And finding refuge doesn’t necessarily entail moving across the country; given the right preparations, it could be closer to home than you think. “While the climate is going to change, how we respond as a species, as a society, as individuals, I think will really determine what is a ‘refuge’ for us and what isn’t,” said Vivek Shandas, a professor at Portland State University whose research focuses on how cities can adapt to climate change. Shandas, who worked on the Northwest chapter of the report, says that it points to how human choices — policies and urban design decisions — have either put people more in harm’s way or brought them greater safety. Tulsa, Oklahoma, was once the country’s most frequently flooded city, according to the assessment. After a disaster in 1984 submerged 7,000 homes and killed 14 people, the city came together to fix the problem with an aggressive flood-control plan. They constructed a network of drainage systems, created green spaces to soak up water, and put strict rules on where new homes could be built. Over the last three decades, Tulsa has also cleared roughly 1,000 buildings out of flood zones through a buyout program. Officials say the effort has saved the city millions of dollars, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency gave Tulsa its top risk-reduction rating last year. That’s the kind of tough work that lies ahead of any Midwest city aiming to protect its residents. With dam failures and overflows from combined sewer and stormwater systems common, the region is unprepared to handle the volume of water now coursing in. “Just being more sheltered from certain dangers does not make you a haven,” said Julie Arbit, who researches equity and the environment at the University of Michigan. And flooding isn’t the only problem. Purported climate havens like Minneapolis, Duluth, Ann Arbor, and Madison, Wisconsin, will see some of the greatest temperature increases in the country in the coming decades. Residents of Michigan and Wisconsin face some of the longest power outages in the country. The idea that any city could be a climate haven traces back to Jesse Keenan, a professor of urban planning at Tulane University — though he suspects the phrase itself was invented by journalists. “People often associate me with coining that concept, but I don’t think I’ve ever used that phrase in any of my talks or writing,” Keenan said (though he did come up with “climate-proof Duluth.”) In 2018, the journalist Oliver Milman wrote an article for The Guardian looking at the parts of the U.S. that might be less miserable as the climate changes, calling Duluth and Buffalo “safe havens.” That framing took off the following year, making the headlines in Reuters, Yale Climate Connections, and Bloomberg. Keenan said he probably wouldn’t have used the phrase “climate havens,” though he does take credit for the proposition behind it. “The general idea is that there are places that people are going to move to, whether we like it or not, whether we plan for it or not,” he said. “We need to help those places and guide those places to prepare.” The idea of climate havens caught on, in part, because it was a hopeful message for post-industrial cities in the Great Lakes region, raising the prospect of filling vacant homes and revitalizing sluggish economies. Over the last two decades, more than 400,000 people left the Midwest for other regions of the United States. In 2019, Buffalo’s mayor called his city a “climate refuge.” The title is still embraced by some city planners: The 2023 Green Cincinnati Plan names the city a “climate haven.” The reality of climate change has weakened the phrase’s charm. Another factor that could be dampening enthusiasm for havens, according to Shandas, is that researchers aren’t getting much federal funding for their proposals to identify the role climate change plays in propelling migration patterns. The National Climate Assessment, for instance, points out that there’s yet not enough data to “make a strong statement” on how climate change might drive migration to the Midwest. Beth Gibbons, an author of the Midwest chapter of the report and the national resilience lead with the consulting group Farallon Strategies, says she’s heard many anecdotes of people moving to the Great Lakes in search of a less hostile climate. Most locals, however, don’t share politicians’ enthusiasm for a wave of climate migration to the Midwest. Interviews across Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Western New York have found that people are nervous about the prospect, Gibbons said. “By and large, the sense in communities is that we have a lot of challenges as it is,” Gibbons said, “and they’re not sure that this sounds like something that is really an opportunity, but rather something else that they may have to be dealing with.” Environmental justice advocates also worry that “the idea of being a climate haven is going to become a distraction from caring for people who are already here.” The “climate havens” conversation has largely revolved around the Midwest, but new research suggests that other parts of the country might be getting overlooked. The Climate Vulnerability Index, released by the Environmental Defense Fund and Texas A&M University last month, maps out risk across the United States on a neighborhood level, measuring environmental dangers alongside factors that make it harder for people to deal with hazards, such as income levels and access to health care. According to data provided to Grist, the least vulnerable counties are mostly rural and scattered across the northern part of the country, from Nantucket County, Massachusetts, to Juneau County, Alaska. The only Midwest spot to make the top 10 was Oneida County in Wisconsin. And the only place with a large population (numbering 600,000 people) on the list was Washington County, Oregon, which includes the east side of Portland. Portland has been named as a potential climate haven before, but the idea has recently fallen out of favor after the Pacific Northwest was struck by an off-the-charts heat dome in June 2021. It brought 116-degree temperatures to Portland, melting streetcar power cables and buckling pavement. In a region largely unaccustomed to owning air-conditioning units, roughly 1,000 people died across Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. “‘Nowhere is safe’: Heat shatters vision of Pacific Northwest as climate refuge,” read a headline in The Guardian at the time. Two years later, Portland and Seattle are more prepared for heat. “The Northwest went bananas with distributing heat pumps and AC units all over the place,” Shandas said. One bad disaster doesn’t necessarily cross a given place off the “havens” list; people can learn from past events and work to better survive the next disaster. And the reality is that most people are unlikely to pack up their belongings and move across the country to find refuge. There’s “no doubt that most people will be moving relatively locally,” Keenan said. He says that climate migration, even at a more local level, presents another opportunity to get it right when it comes to urban development. “We can either recreate crap suburban sprawl and high-carbon sprawl, or we can try to do it the right way. But we will branch into new cities in America, and those may be closer to home than we realize.” “Local refuges” might provide a better framework for discussing how to escape the worst of climate change, Shandas said. He borrowed the concept from the field of ecology, where the Latin “refugia” refers to areas where the climate conditions stay relatively safe over time, despite change happening around them. A local refuge could be a community center with air conditioning during a heat wave. Or it could mean moving out of a wildfire danger zone, or up the hill to escape frequent flooding. “For me, that’s a wonderful thought,” Shandas said, “because it allows humans to actually not be the victim of, like, ‘Oh my God, no matter where we go, we’re going to be crushed by this climate.’ And it’s like, ‘No, actually, there are things we can do.” This article originally appeared in Grist at https://grist.org/migration/climate-havens-national-climate-assessment-midwest-migration/.

It manifests in many ways, from empty spaces in supermarket shelves to houses left unlivable after floods, anxious communities, collapsing ecosystems and emergency services stretched to capacity.Climate researchers initially assumed that if you gave people the right information, we would act on it. Burningfossil fuelscomes with severe consequences—so let's phase out fossil fuels. But they found out very quickly this was not the case.For many people, it triggeredcognitive dissonance, where they knew climate change was happening butacted like it wasn't. After all, many people still smoke, even though they know it is bad for their health. And many of us still fly to Italy—even though we know how many extra tons of carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere.But why is it so easy to understand but not act?Change seems hard, doing nothing is easyIt's because of public and private narratives we have grown up with. Our expectations of life are geared towards wanting comfort and stability.This means not everyone has developed the ways of thinking needed to deal with the impacts (such as natural hazards) we are now facing. Sudden changes caused by these—such as the loss of a home—are almost invariably shocking and can create a sense of disbelief. How could this be? When do we get back to normal? Surely it won't happen again?Ourresearch on systemic riskssuch asclimate change adaptationsuggests this disconnect is common. Because we expect and hope for stable normality, we find it hard to truly believe the changes we are seeing will continue.Credit: The ConversationThere's also a divide between who benefits and who pays. Your family trip to Iceland pays off for you in shared memories and good times. The damage in terms of emissions is spread across the globe. Often the damage done has less impact on the people who have done most to cause it, compounding inequality and eroding the ability of those most at risk to respond.Adapting to the climate and working to reduce further heating can be an uncomfortable and at times painful process where we have to embrace and acknowledge our grief for the changing world. We're often taught to avoid potentially dangerous or painful things—especially if they are unfamiliar. But now, doing what we've always done is not safe.Then there are the limitations of individual action. No matter how committed you are to cutting your own climate impact, it makes very little difference if others aren't doing the same.Action needs to be collaborative and sustained over the longer term, favoring public good over individual vested interests and short term gains. The politicization of action in Australia's climate wars haspolarized opinionand eroded trust in the research. It has also left some people feeling that their actions are too small to matter.All of this means we can find it surprisingly easy to detach our own daily actions—driving to work, holidays in Queensland, watching Netflix—from the broader goals of getting emissions down to zero as soon as possible.So how can we avoid climate hypocrisy?Many of us understand the risks of climate change full well, but we do not accept the responsibility. That, in turn, means we may feel okay not to act. Or we may understand and accept the risk, but not have the resources or ability to act.We know that presenting climate change as a problem without a solution or using fear tacticsdisengages and demotivates us. It can also feed anxiety, which undermines action.So the first step to overcoming climate inaction is to identify where you can act directly, such as switching your second car to an e-bike, investing insolar panels, working on local re-vegetation projects or making climate-friendly consumer choices.Where you have influence, apply this through voting, education or advocacy. Humble actions matter because they accumulate to create change.This isn't to say you should give up holidays. It is about making informed choices. Ending the burning of fossil fuels will take time and our choices will change as we transition away from this.But doing something is always better than nothing. Active responses can help reduce climate anxiety and they are also the panacea for avoiding climate hypocrisy. And while large-scale policy responses are necessary, individual action and pressure can help speed up the shift.Climate change isn't just a problem for scientists, engineers and governments. We need both large-scale and small-scale action. As the costs ofclimatechange escalate, we can no longer afford to know aboutclimate changebut not act.","['italy', 'iceland', 'australia', 'australia']",gb,False,False

The death toll from flashfloodingcaused by torrential rains in Somalia has risen to 50, with nearly 700,000 people driven from their homes, according to a government official. With more heavy rains starting on Tuesday, the plight of people in the country is expected to worsen, he said. “Fifty people died in the disaster … while 687,235 people were forced to flee their houses,” Mohamud Moalim Abdullahi, the director of the Somali Disaster Management Agency, said at a news conference on Monday. “The expected rains between 21st and 24th of November … may cause more flooding which could cause death and destruction.” The Horn of Africa region is experiencing heavy downpours and floods linked to the El Nino weather phenomenon, killing dozens of people and causing large-scale displacement, including in Somalia, where the rains have destroyed bridges and inundated residential areas. The floods and extreme rains have resulted in “catastrophic” consequences for hundreds of thousands who have lost their homes and properties, or their animals and crops, the International Rescue Committee said in a statement on Monday, adding that more than 1.7 million people are in “urgent need”. “With above-normal rainfall expected to persist until the end of 2023, this will exacerbate the already grave humanitarian situation, whereby 4.3 million people, a quarter of the population are expected to face crisis-level hunger or worse by the end of 2023,” the aid agency added. NGO World Vision said the current floods have destroyed homes, schools and roads, leaving children without basic needs such as shelter, food and drinking water. “The floods have made life extremely difficult for children. Ongoing flooding has destroyed homes forcing children and their families to leave their homes, some of whom are now sheltering in makeshift structures in the open. As they move, they are at increased risk of illness,” Kevin Mackey, the organisation’s Somalia country director, said in a statement on Monday. On Saturday, the United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA said the number of people displaced by heavy rains and floods in Somalia “has nearly doubled in one week”. “In addition, roads, bridges and airstrips have been damaged in several areas, affecting the movement of people and supplies and leading to increased prices of basic commodities,” OCHA said. British charity Save the Children on Thursday said more than 100 people, including 16 children, had died and hundreds of thousands were forced from their homes in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia due to flash flooding. The Horn of Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change and extreme weather events are occurring with increased frequency and intensity. The region is emerging from the worst drought in four decades after multiple failed rainy seasons that left millions of people in need and devastated crops and livestock. Humanitarian groups have warned that the situation is only likely to worsen and called for urgent global intervention as El Nino is expected to last until at least April 2024.

Notwithstanding these commi… [+6219 chars]",Weather,"At therecent G20 summit in New Delhi,world leaders reiterated their commitment to addressing climate change challenges by building sustainable and appropriate solutions. Notwithstanding these commitments, climate-induced loss and damage are taking place in different parts of the world. With an extensive coastline of around 7,517 kilometres, India is among the most vulnerable countries, with exposure to rising sea levels, floods and droughts. The marginalised communities living in the coastal belt are particularly vulnerable to these extreme weather events, which cost the country over 17,000 lives between 2012 and 2021 alone. Extreme climate events have a significant impact on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services as droughts, floods, and cyclones can damage toilets, water supplies, and sewerage infrastructure, affecting the quality of water supply and sewage spillage. This has disastrous health impacts on the communities living in the slum settlements of urban cities. Water was mentioned for the first time in the final declaration adopted at the UN Conference of the Parties (COP27) held at Sharm el-Sheikh in November 2022. Building on the resolutions and commitments made at COP27, countries have to make serious efforts to find effective solutions to address the climate impact on WASH at the forthcoming COP28 in Dubai. The responsibility for providing drinking water supply and sanitation services falls under the purview of state governments, as outlined in the State List of the Seventh Schedule. The 74th Amendment to the Constitution mandated the devolution of these services to the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). Despite India having the policy framework for WASH-related policies in flagship missions such as the Swachh Bharat and Jal Jeevan missions, the country still struggles with developing a climate-resilient WASH infrastructure and sustainable practices. Understanding and improving resilience requires reliable data that offers insights into urban dynamics and the potential challenges faced by the poor living in these settlements. In this context, the risk and vulnerability assessment that the Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) did, supported by the Water for Women initiative of the Australian government, to identify the potential climatic risks and their impact on WASH infrastructure in the slum areas of Jaipur and Bhubaneswar, provides important insights. For this, we selected households in 19 wards and 24 wards in Bhubaneswar and Jaipur respectively. As the spatial locations of slums play a significant role in designing appropriate local actions for the resilience of the marginalised groups, we selected slum settlements which are susceptible to climate change impacts. For example, in Bhubaneswar, 48.6 per cent of settlements were situated near drains and canal roads, exposing them to potential flooding during heavy rains. The consequences are evident when considering the 2011 Census data for a total of 67 wards in Bhubaneswar and 77 wards in Jaipur; it reveals that 52 per cent and 16 per cent of the wards, respectively, face high vulnerability due to multiple indicators, including illiteracy, lack of access to electricity and mobile phones, and the significant presence of marginalised communities, particularly Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. These factors, when combined with the three critical WASH indicators (lack of latrine facilities, wastewater treatment and access to treated drinking water), compound the vulnerabilities and significantly impact the overall resilience of these populations. The pressing question is whether programmes like the Swachh Bharat Mission and AMRUT scheme, which have diligently worked to improve WASH infrastructure in informal settlements, have adequately addressed climate preparedness on both small and large scales. Our study emphasises the consequences of climate events on water and sanitation services. While tap connections have improved to 92 per cent in Bhubaneswar and 72 per cent in Jaipur, these figures drop, respectively, to 77 per cent and 25 per cent during adverse climate events, forcing people to resort to government and private tankers. Similarly, access to latrine facilities declined during these events, leading to a surge in open defecation, from 6 per cent to 18 per cent in Bhubaneswar and 11 per cent to 80 per cent in Jaipur. People are aware of the need for raised pit latrines in flood-prone areas, but financial constraints and the low-lying location of households hinder their construction. Additionally, while public/mobile toilets have increased to 11 per cent in Bhubaneswar and 6.4 per cent in Jaipur, they are often submerged and unclean after heavy rains, emphasising the need for climate-resilient WASH infrastructure and community preparedness; this is particularly vital due to the high prevalence of vector- and water-borne diseases. Therefore, the spread of diseases adds another layer of challenges, with 80 per cent of slum residents in Bhubaneswar and 63 per cent in Jaipur reporting fever, skin infections, malaria, dengue and typhoid, loss of livelihood, with economic instability and increased healthcare costs. Women and girls suffered the most, grappling with menstrual hygiene challenges and facing harassment while relieving themselves due to the lack of home toilets. Despite facing a series of challenges, the silver lining is that the people are adaptive and not ready to give up. People across slums and wards continuously find and experiment with ways to address these challenges. To combat the spread of waterborne diseases, they regularly test water quality in various wards, such as 16, 18, 30, and 49 in Bhubaneswar, and 7, 84, 93, and 99 in Jaipur; they also monitor places prone to waterlogging independently. Moreover, they take it upon themselves to get defunct water sources, like hand-pumps, repaired and have prepared alternative water sources in wards such as 5, 18, 19, and 46 in Bhubaneswar and ward 84 and 99 in Jaipur. Governments can further strengthen people’s initiatives by strengthening their capacity to sustain safe sanitation and incentivising them to revive alternative water sources, store water to cope with supply irregularities, and conduct regular water testing for a resilient and sustainable future.

The messaging platform, despite its Russian origins, had gradually become a popular online watering hole capable of displacing Twitter, now called X, in Ukraine. Young Ukrainians flooded there to find the latest news, and Russian disinformation often quickly followed. But in those first days, Laba, who studied computer science, logged into his local community channel where students were advertising the possibility of using their skills in cyber ""to give some impact or to help the country, to help the military, to help the government,"" he recalled during a Zoom interview with NPR. ""And that's how it all began."" Laba is one of the co-founders, along with Mykhailo Kunynets, of Cyber Regiment, one of perhaps dozens of Ukrainian volunteer cyber ""hacktivist"" organizations that have sprung up and evolved since Russia invaded. At first these groups appeared disorganized and were outwardly dismissed. They largely ran unsophisticated denial of service operations, flooding Russian targets with traffic to temporarily take them offline. However, they appear to have stepped up their operations in recent months, launching more sophisticated hack and leak campaigns, open source intelligence operations, and other disruptive campaigns. Additionally, they appear to have more coordination with the Ukrainian government. It's difficult to measure their true effectiveness. But now, their work might have more impact on the war — if not on the outcome — with helping to gather intelligence and to disrupt and disturb Russian targets, many of which Ukrainian officials direct them toward. Given the Russian government's advanced cyber capabilities and the army of Russian cybercriminals at the Kremlin's disposal, Ukraine, which has no formal cyber army of its own, needs to find ways to make use of its many volunteers. Cyber Regiment, for one,describes itselfas a ""Ukrainian association of volunteers, which has been protecting the independence of our state in cyberspace since the first days of the war."" It grew in part out of the Student Committee for the Cyber Defense of Ukraine, and the founders explain that they still work with some students, who have a unique combination of skill, drive and time on their hands. While the cofounders declined to share many details about current operations, they told NPR about a contest they recently hosted focused on gathering open-source intelligence about Russian intelligence officers. The contest was called Undercover Chronicles, and it was cosponsored by partners in government and academia including the Cyber Intelligence Committee of Ukraine. They claim to have received ""dozens"" of submissions. Laba said they're sharing the results of the contest with their government partners, and that the submitter who won the contest donated the prize fund to medical organizations supporting wounded Ukrainian soldiers. Next, they plan on running a penetration testing contest to help find vulnerabilities in Russia's systems, another element of their ongoing operations. In the early days of the war, Laba explained, things were more chaotic. Cyber Regiment and others were throwing ideas at the wall — launching ""denial of service attacks"" against any Russian targets they could find, openly sharing software tools so other people could launch attacks. Now, the group, which has over 30 active members, is running specific, targeted campaigns with clear objectives, primarily to gather intelligence. ""Now we have much more strategic and specific goals,"" Laba said. ""We use our resources, skills, and knowledge to get certain data from certain sources of companies or whatever."" When asked whether they're coordinating with Ukrainian government agencies, Kunynets said there is ""some type of communication."" There's also, perhaps most famously, the IT Army—endorsed publicly by Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation. And there'sHack Your Mom, born out of a collective of hacktivists in Kharkiv. There's Cyber.Unit Tech, a startup born in a parking garage the day of Russia's invasion that's also focused on training cyber defenders in Kyiv and raising money for various Ukrainian causes. Some groups' memberships have combined, like the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance. Other volunteers are organizing and publishing information and articles, like InformNapalm. And there are perhaps dozens of others, some open and others more secretive, who have organized around the goal of volunteering in cyberspace for Ukraine. The lines between these groups are sometimes blurry. In fact, Kunynets says the IT Army actually had ""a different owner"" in the early days of war, and he now estimates there being over 30 separate groups. Previously, at least in the West, these groups have often been dismissed as an unorganized horde, a nuisance that haven't had a major impact while potentially taking away from more professional government cyber operations. But there's growing recognition that many of these volunteers are skillful, and that they're becoming better tools in the Ukrainian government's arsenal. For one, the Center for International and Strategic Studies' Aiden Render-Katolik describes the IT Army as an organization ""that has quietly transformed from an ad-hoc group of volunteers into a tightly organized operation, with ongoing support from Ukrainian government officials, tens of thousands of international participants and industry-leading tools."" The IT Army's development ""presents vital lessons for the landscape of cyber conflict,"" wrote Render-Katolikin August. Stefan Soesanto, a senior defense researcher at The Center for Security Studies in Zurich, has dedicated a significant amount of time to studying the IT Army, which he described in June 2022 as Kyiv's ""creative"" solution for the question of ""how to combine its nascent military and intelligence cyber capabilities with a massive, willing, and global civilian IT community in defense of the nation."" He concluded then that it was a ""unique and smart construct,"" which poses new questions about existing legal frameworks and ""the future stability of cyberspace,"" particularly once the war is over. Ukraine's government will have to figure out how to incorporate those skillful hackers back into society, and prevent them from launching criminal cyberattacks. But for now, there's additional evidence for the impact of volunteers during the war. The Ukrainian Cyber Alliance, a collective of Ukrainian cyber activists from across the country, recently took down a ransomware gang called Trigona, breaching their servers, stealing data and taking their public pages offline. Trigona is one of many criminal cyber gangs with connections to the Russian government, often acting as a cutout or hired mercenary in exchange for leniency for their criminal activity. Cyber experts interviewed by NPR confirmed Trigona's website was taken down and that the operation appeared successful. Perhaps most notably, a pair of Ukrainian hacktivist organizations recentlypartnered with Ukrainiancounterintelligence agency SBU to hack Alfabank, one of the most prominent financial institutions that caters to Russia's wealthy elite. Alfabank executives appeared to confirm the breach. A source confirmed to NPR that SBU participated, but did not elaborate on what role the agency played. It's not surprising that Ukrainian government agencies, aware of these groups' existence and without a formal cyber army to draw upon, would make use of their skills — at minimum to gather information. ""In our personal opinion, the cyber operations carried out by our organization ... are a unique example in the world,"" Laba, the co-founder of Cyber Regiment, told NPR. He suggested that their example could help other countries who experience similar conflicts. But it's after the war that the impacts of cyber hacktivism and volunteering might truly be felt. Ukraine's national security and law enforcement officials are currently compiling a dossier of evidence against Russia's Sandworm hackers to present to the International Criminal Court in the Hague, drawing upon large volumes of data collected by government intelligence agencies and from outside organizations. If they are successful with that case, it could be the first time that cybercrimes have been elevated to the level of international war crimes. While Laba and Kunynets said they weren't sure whether the intelligence Cyber Regiment is gathering is a part of ongoing cases against Russian hackers. But they are ""sharing this data with government agencies,"" Laba said. ""Our goal is the same,"" he concluded.","['russia', 'russia', 'russia', 'russia', 'russia', 'russia', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'switzerland', 'italy', 'italy', 'italy']",us,True,False

to relocate citizens.Instead, President Mohamed Muizzu promises the low-lying nation will beat back the waves through ambitious land reclamation and building islands higher—policies, however, that environmental andrights groupswarn could even exacerbate flooding risks.The upmarket holiday destination is famed for its white sand beaches, turquoise lagoons and vast coral reefs, but the chain of 1,192 tiny islands is on the frontlines of the climate crisis and battling for survival.Former president Mohamed Nasheed began his administration 15 years ago warning citizens they might become the world's first environmental refugees needing relocation to another country.He wanted the Maldives to start saving to buy land in neighboring India, Sri Lanka or even far away in Australia.But Muizzu, 45, while asking for $500 million in foreign funding to protect vulnerable coasts, said his citizens will not be leaving their homeland.""If we need to increase the area for living or othereconomic activity, we can do that,"" Muizzu told AFP, speaking from the crowded capital Male, which is ringed with concrete sea walls.""We are self-sufficient to look after ourselves"".President Mohamed Muizzu promises the low-lying nation will beat back the waves through ambitious land reclamation and building islands higher.'Out of fresh water'The tiny nation of Tuvalu this month inked a deal to give citizens the right to live in Australia when their Pacific homeland is lost beneath the seas.But Muizzu said the Maldives would not follow that route.""I can categorically say that we definitely don't need to buy land or even lease land from any country,"" Muizzu said.Sea walls will ensure risk areas can be ""categorized as a safe island"", he said.But 80 percent of the Maldives is less than a meter (three feet) abovesea level.And while fortress-like walls ringing tightly-packed settlements can keep the waves at bay, the fate of the beach islands the tourists come for are uncertain.Tourism accounts for almost one-third of the economy, according to the World Bank.Nasheed's predecessor, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, was the first to ring the alarm of the possible ""death of a nation"", warning the United Nations in 1985 of the threat posed by rising sea levels linked to climate change.The Maldives, a chain of 1,192 tiny islands in the Indian Ocean, is on the frontline of a battle for survival.The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned in 2007 that rises of 18 to 59 centimeters (7.2 to 23.2 inches) would make the Maldives virtually uninhabitable by the end of the century.The warning lights are already flashing red.Gayoom's fear of his country running out of drinking water has already come true, as rising salt levels seep into land, corrupting potable water.""Every island in the Maldives has run out of fresh water,"" said Shauna Aminath, 38, the environment minister until last week, when Muizzu's government took power.Almost all of the 187 inhabited islets in the archipelago depend on expensive desalination plants, she told AFP.""Finding ways as to how we protect our islands has been a huge part of how we are trying to adapt to these changes"", Aminath said.Tourism accounts for almost one-third of the economy, according to the World Bank.Environmental regulations 'ignored'The capital Male, where a third of the country's 380,000 citizens are squeezed onto a tiny island, is ""one of the most densely populated pieces of land in the world"" with 65,700 people persquare kilometer, according to the environment ministry.A giant sea wall already surrounds the city, but Muizzu said there is potential to expand elsewhere.Reclamation projects have already increased the country's landmass by about 10 percent in the past four decades, using sand pumped onto submerged coral platforms, totaling 30 square kilometers (11 square miles).Muizzu, a British-educated civil engineer and former construction minister for seven years, played a key part in that, overseeing the expansion of the artificial island of Hulhumale.Linked to the capital by a Chinese-built 1.4-kilometer (0.8-mile) bridge, with tower blocks rising high over the blue seas, Hulhumale is double the area of Male, home to about 100,000 people.Environmental and rights groups warn that while reclamation is needed, it must be done with care.The capital Male is ""one of

""Look at the height and health of this plant - the number of florets on it is amazing,"" he said. Located in the northern state of Haryana, one of India 's main rice and wheat-growing regions, Singh's 80-acre (32.4-hectare) farm is part of a gradual shift in how Indians cultivate their staple crops, from a model that is fertiliser and water-intensive to more natural, climate-friendly ways. What convinced middle-aged traditional farmer Singh to change how he grows rice was the prospect of benefiting from another fledgling movement: generating carbon credits through sustainable agriculture to sell for additional income. ""The new method of rice cultivation is not only helping my land regain its fertility - it is also helping fight global warming,"" Singh said. He expects to be among the first tranche of Indian farmers to receive payments from the carbon market. A score of private firms have emerged in the past few years in India, tying up with farmers like Singh to generate carbon credits, even as the role of voluntary carbon offsetting in reducing global climate-heating emissions comes under scrutiny. Across the country, these startups are enrolling farmers who cultivate resource-intensive crops like rice, cotton and sugarcane and are nudging them to use practices that emit less planet-warming gases - and in return generating credits for the avoided carbon and methane emissions from their farms. Emissions from agriculture and land use accounted for 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, according to U.N. data. HIGHER YIELDS, LOWER EMISSIONS Singh first heard about the carbon credit programme in 2019 from a representative of Grow Indigo, one of the new backers of agriculture-based carbon offset projects in India. Grow Indigo is a joint venture of India-based seed firm Mahyco Grow and U.S.-based agriculture technology company Indigo Ag which produces and sells farm-linked carbon credits. With technical support from Grow Indigo, Singh tested a new way of cultivating rice on 20 acres of his farm. Instead of transplanting seedlings from a nursery into flooded fields, he used a drill machine to directly sow seed into the soil. The new method - called direct seeded rice (DSR) - cuts the overall cost of cultivation by using 12-35% less irrigation water and reducing labour, sowing time and use of chemical herbicides and fertilisers. ""My rice yields have increased without having to flood my fields again and again - which also stops methane generation,"" said Singh. Produced by bacteria in flooded fields, among other sources, methane is a short-lived greenhouse gas that has more potent capacity to heat up the Earth's climate than carbon dioxide (CO2). The cultivation of rice - a staple food for more than 3 billion people worldwide - is responsible for 12% of global methane emissions and 1.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Singh also changed his traditional method of cultivating wheat, a winter crop that follows the monsoon crop of rice. After harvesting rice, Singh no longer sets the stubble on fire - a major seasonal source of air pollution. Instead, he mulches and spreads the stubble across the field, into which he plants wheat seeds directly without tilling - a practice that disturbs the soil and releases carbon. The new ""zero-till"" method helps trap soil carbon, while mulching increases the fertility of the soil. FAIR SHARE FOR FARMERS Typically, avoiding or reducing greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to one tonne of CO2 generates one carbon credit. For instance, when Singh avoids methane emissions from his rice cultivation or sequesters carbon in the soil by not tilling it, he can generate one carbon credit per acre. Grow Indigo measures this carbon storage over a period using a combination of sampling methods and satellite monitoring, and then has it checked by a third-party auditor. Once verified and entered on a recognised registry, the credits are available for purchase by buyers who want to offset their own carbon emissions, such as corporations or individuals. For example, a multinational company could buy the credits to compensate for the emissions of its employees' air travel. Generally, the price of one credit - depending on its quality - ranges between $2 and $50 on the voluntary carbon market, said Umang Agarwal, head of carbon and sustainable produce at Grow Indigo. Agarwal said he hoped Indigo Agriculture's strict methodology would allow the Indian credits to fetch a high price, with farmers set to receive 75% of the revenue compared to the 35-45% share offered by some companies in India. ""If the money for carbon credits comes, good - otherwise I am happy with the yield gains through new methods,"" said Gurucharan Singh Bhuttar, another farmer cultivating wheat and rice on 60 acres in Karnal district. Bhuttar, who signed up with Grow Indigo about four years ago, said his wheat yield has increased after switching to the zero-till method, bringing in additional income of about 500,000 rupees ($6,000) per year as well as lower cultivation costs. Carbon credits from agriculture are still a nascent market globally, according to Ecosystem Marketplace, an international repository of information on payments for ecosystem services. Its figures show that in 2021, 500 million carbon credits were traded globally, valued at $2 billion. Of those, agriculture credits accounted for only 1 million, or about 0.2%. Indian developers have yet to sell any farm offsets on the international carbon market, but Grow Indigo predicts they could grow into a $5 billion-$7 billion market in India in a decade. DOUBTS OVER CLIMATE BENEFITS Globally, the voluntary carbon market has come under fire over the integrity of its contribution to the fight against warming. Failings identified by researchers include emissions reduction claims that are temporary or were already happening, displacement of the emissions to other sites, exaggerated climate benefits and projects that would take place even without finance from the carbon market. In the case of India, a recent analysis from the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a Delhi-based think-tank, noted that the sale price of credits is ""at times inflated and at times it is so low that the project becomes unviable"". In some cases, the CSE found that a project had issued too many credits or had not resulted in the changes claimed on the ground. People who provided land and labour were not fairly compensated and project-related information was not transparent, it said in a report. ""I have never personally seen such a shroud of secrecy as I found in this market,"" CSE's director general Sunita Narain told the report's launch. ""The entire purpose of these markets seems to serve the interests of project developers, buyers and intermediaries and not the mitigation of emissions,"" she added, calling for a floor price of $30 per credit. Governments should consider these lessons when they meet at the COP28 U.N. climate conference in December to discuss the rules for global carbon markets, Narain added. Back in Karnal district, meanwhile, Singh is enthusiastically awaiting the first reward for his new eco-friendly approach. ""If one farmer receives these carbon credit payments, others will not need much convincing to join,"" he said.

New York 20 November 2023 The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General. **Noon Briefing Guests Alright, good afternoon. We are delighted to be joined by our colleagues from the World Health Organization (WHO). We have with us Dr. Michael Ryan, the Executive Director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, and he is in Geneva, and with some luck, we should have Rob Holden, WHO's Senior Emergency Officer, who is joining us from Gaza. But, I do know that we have some problems connecting Rob. They will obviously be talking to you about the situation of the health sector in Gaza and the recent evacuation from the Al-Shifa. So, without further ado, Michael, you go ahead, and hopefully Rob will join us. [...] Alright, I may have a bit of news. **Gaza Just to stay in the topic with an update from our Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs colleagues about the situation in Gaza: They tell us that about 69,000 litres of fuel entered Gaza from Egypt yesterday. The Israeli authorities have confirmed that they would start allowing the entry of a daily amount of approximately 70,000 litres of fuel from Egypt, which while good, remains well below the minimum requirements for essential humanitarian operations. Fuel is set to be distributed by UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]. UNRWA also tells us that with that, they will support food distribution and the operation of generators at hospitals, water and sanitation facilities, shelters, and other critical services. Yesterday, UNRWA and UNICEF [United Nations Children's Fund] distributed some 19,500 litres of fuel to water and sanitation facilities south of Wadi Gaza, enabling them to operate generators and resume their operation. That amount of fuel is expected to last for about 24 hours. To the north of Wadi Gaza, all water and sanitation facilities are presumed to be shut down, and no distribution of bottled water has been taking place since the start of the Israeli ground operations on 28 October, raising grave concerns about dehydration and waterborne diseases. UNRWA has also reported that the number of fatalities in the attack that directly hit Al Fakhouri school in Jabalia on 18 November is at least 24 people, with others injured. At the time of the incident, the facility was sheltering about 7,000 internally displaced persons. In astatementthat you saw yesterday, the Secretary-General said he was deeply shocked that two UNRWA schools were struck in less than 24 hours in Gaza. Dozens of people and children were killed and injured as they were seeking safety in United Nations premises. The Secretary-General reaffirmed that UN premises are inviolable. He also reiterated his call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. **Yemen Also, I was asked about the incident that took place in the Red Sea, concerning the ship, and I can tell you that while the circumstances around the incident remain unclear, we are following with deep concern reports of the seizure by the Houthis of a vessel flying the flag of the Bahamas in the Red Sea and reportedlyen routebetween Türkiye and India. We reaffirm the importance of ensuring that international law is respected in full in relation to maritime navigation, freedom of navigation. We urge all concerned parties and countries in the region to exercise maximum restraint and refrain from taking any escalatory actions. **Emissions Gap Report Back here, this morning, you saw the Secretary-General launched the 2023 UNEP [United Nations Environment Programme] Emissions Gap report, which is not good news, and says that if nothing changes, in 2030, emissions will be 22 Gigatonnes higher than the 1.5 degree-limit will allow. That's roughly the total present annual emissions of the USA, China, and the European Union combined. That report was shared with you. **Secretary-General's Travel He also announced that later today he will travel to Chile and then to Antarctica to see the deadly impact of the climate crisis. Scorching temperatures mean Antarctic ice is melting faster, with deadly consequences for people around the world. While in Antarctica he is expected to stop to see the Collins and Nelson Glaciers, and he will also stop at the Kopaitic Island, which is home to penguins and other species which are being impacted by climate change. The Secretary-General will be accompanied on this trip by President of Chile, Gabriel Boric. The Secretary-General will also take his experiences in Antarctica to COP28 [twenty-eighth Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] in Dubai next week, where he will call for action that matches the scale of the crisis we face. We expected him back in New York on Sunday. And we have pencilled in on Monday afternoon a stakeout with him, in which he will answer some of your questions. **Security Council The Security Council alsometthis morning. The Secretary-General spoke at their debate on the vital link between development and sustaining peace. He told Council members that development by itself is not enough to secure peace, but it is essential. No peace is secure without inclusive and sustainable development that leaves no one behind. Noting that development gains are often among the first casualties of war; the closer a country is to conflict, the farther it is from sustainable and inclusive development. By contrast, he added, human development lights the way to hope — promoting prevention, security and peace. This is why advancing peace and advancing sustainable, inclusive development go hand-in-hand, he said. Those remarks were shared with you. **Mali A couple of peacekeeping updates, the first from Mali, where the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) tells us that it has closed its base in Ansongo, in the Gao region of eastern Mali, and handed it over to civilian authorities on Saturday 18 November. Over the past decade of service in Ansongo, peacekeepers have played a key role in stabilizing the area and contributing to reducing the impact of terrorist groups, in support of local authorities and the Malian Defense and Security Forces. The UN Mission noted that these efforts include securing the transborder road that connects Niger to Mali, which has been vital for the country and the broader region. To protect civilians and restore state authority, the Mission also undertook numerous activities, including building and equipping facilities for the Malian forces and local police, providing fuel for their security patrols, and securing the airstrip for humanitarian [activities]. The Peacekeeping Mission in Mali also provided basic services to help prevent community conflict and improve living conditions, including access to safe drinking water and electricity. Despite these improvements, persistent insecurity remains a challenge, mainly due to the limited presence of national authorities. The Ansongo camp is the ninth of 13 bases that have closed under MINUSMA's plan to withdraw from Mali by 31 December. That is in line of course with the Security Council wishes. The Mopti base will close in early December, and the liquidation phase in remaining sites in Timbuktu, Gao and Bamako will begin on 1 January. **Abyei From Abyei, our peacekeeping mission in there, UNISFA, has strongly condemned attacks by a group of armed youths on villages in the area around Angath, Wunpeth, and Korioch yesterday, which resulted in a number of people killed and injured. It also reports that, contrary to what was reported in a number of media over the weekend, no peacekeeper was killed or wounded during these incidents. In response to the attacks, UNISFA moved quickly to enhance security in the impacted area by intensifying patrols, closely monitoring the situation and engaging with the relevant communities. **Niger And going back to West Africa, Niger, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that last week, on 14 November to be precise, 320 tons of therapeutic nutritional products from the World Food Programme (WFP) arrived in Niamey as part of trucks transporting humanitarian goods which entered the country through Burkina Faso. This was the first entry of humanitarian goods into the country since 26 July. More humanitarian transports — including medicines, medical equipment, water and sanitation items and therapeutic foods from UNICEF are on their way to Niger, and those will arrive from Togo to Kaya in Burkina Faso. This is a welcome development for humanitarian organizations, whose stocks were almost depleted while needs remain high across the country. We have been reporting. To give you a sense of the needs, 4.3 million people need humanitarian assistance in Niger, including 3.3 million people who are food insecure, according to the latest food security analysis. Our humanitarian partners are working on statistics for next year and we will be communicating those figures towards the end of the year. **Somalia And crossing the continent, backing to the east, in Somalia, out humanitarian colleagues are telling us that heavy rains and floods have impacted [half] a million people in the past week alone. This brings the total number of people impacted since the start of floods in early October to 1.7 million. The number of people displaced also continues to increase and has reached more than 640,000. According to our partners, at least 41 people have been killed, including 12 children. Roads, bridges and airstrips have been damaged in many parts of the country, hampering the movement of people and supplies and leading to higher prices of basic commodities. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warns that suspected cases of Acute Watery Diarrhoea and cholera are rising and are expected to [further increase]. Our humanitarian partners, the authorities and local communities have stepped up assistance to impacted people. More than 740,000 men, women and children have received life-saving assistance since October. Despite the rapidly growing needs, funding for the humanitarian response remains low. With six weeks in the year remaining, the Humanitarian Response Plan for Somalia is only 40 per cent funded. **Liberia And you will have seen that over the weekend we issued a statement on Liberia, where the Secretary-General commended the Government and people of Liberia for the 2023 presidential and legislative elections, which took place in a calm and peaceful manner. These were the first general elections since the closing of the UN Mission in Liberia in 2018. The Secretary General reaffirms the continued support of the United Nations to the people of Liberia in their efforts to consolidate peace, democracy, and sustainable development. **International Days International days: Today is Africa Industrialization Day. In his message, the Secretary-General says that accelerating Africa's industrialization is vital for growth, diversifying economies and combatting poverty. And today is of course World Children's Day. UNICEF tells us that 400 million children — or about one child in every five — are living in or fleeing from conflict zones. But beyond conflict zones, children's rights also are under threat. These include rising poverty and inequality, public health emergencies and, of course the global climate crisis. Mr. Klein? **Questions and Answers Question: Thank you. This question regards the shipment of fuel into Gaza. First of all, are those shipments going directly to UNRWA personnel? Spokesman: Yes. Question: And secondly, what monitoring process, if any, is in place to make sure that the fuel gets to where it's needed, hospitals, etc. rather than being perhaps stolen by Hamas? Spokesman: UNRWA has decades and decades of experience of working in Gaza and ensuring that monies and supplies go to whom it's intended. The fuel goes to run UN-run facilities, including health centres and others. So it remains in the... as far as I know, it remains in the custody of the UN the whole time. Margaret? Question: Just a follow-up on the fuel. Okay. So it's supposed to be a 140,000 litres every 48 hours. So I guess that means they're... you said they got 69,000, so the half of it? Spokesman: Yeah. It said 70,000 about a day. Yeah. Question: So are they going to do it...? Spokesman: 70,000 a day. Question: So they're going to split it and go daily. But then there's supposed to be another 20,000 litres for PalTel, the communications entity. Is that going to go through UNRWA also or directly to them? Spokesman: I don't know. It's a very valid question and I will check. Question: Because... And can you check and see if it was delivered? Spokesman: I will check everything you asked me to check. Dezhi, and then... I will get there. Question: Also a couple of follow-ups. First of all, follow ups, also on the fuel. You just mentioned that 70,000 litres of fuel each day, it's below the minimum requirements. Can we know what would be the minimum requirements? [cross talk] Spokesman: Yeah, I mean, as I was... as I was reading it. That was my question. I believe it's in the hundreds of thousands, but I'll check with the... what we actually... what the volume would be to meet the actual needs. Question: So the second follow-up, you just mentioned that the Secretary-General issued a statement on the attack on two UNRWA schools there. I know this question sounds stupid, but I have to confirm this. Does these schools... do these schools have Hamas bases or weapons in there? Because I think it's UNRWA school. You guys know the situation. Spokesman: These schools were there to shelter civilians. Right? They are not there to shelter combatants. The coordinates of these schools have been communicated. These schools didn't pop up overnight. They've been there for a long, long time. It is unacceptable that people seeking shelter under the UN flag be then confronted with these types of bombings. Question: Okay. So one last question. This question is concerning the climate crisis. I think, yeah, today, there has been a report released called ""Climate Equality: a Planet for the 99%"", which, in this report, it says that in 2019, the superrich 1% were responsible for 16% of global carbon emissions, which is the same as the emissions of the poorest 66% of the humanity. Just want to know what does the Secretary-General has to say of these findings? Spokesman: First of all, we have no doubt as to the solid scientific base of what our Oxfam colleagues put together. And it is yet another glaring example of the impact of inequality that we see in the world that impacts not only basic services, people's lives, but climate, as well. Question: But then what does the UN think the super-rich 1 per cent should do? Spokesman: People should be more responsible and think of others. Yes, ma'am. Oh sorry. And I'll get to you in a second. Question: Thank you. I'm wondering if you have any update on the possibility of opening the Kerem Shalom Crossing? Spokesman: No, no update. And as I said, as soon as... if there was positive answer, we would share that with you pretty quickly. Question: But are there any ongoing negotiations? Spokesman: Yeah, I mean we're... this is something we've been in discussions with the Israeli authorities and been pushing for. Anade? Question: Thank you Steph. Steph, my question is last week, you said that Under-Secretary General Rosemary DiCarlo was traveling to the region. And if I remember correctly, you said her diplomatic efforts would start on Sunday, which is yesterday. You also mentioned that she'd be meeting with Israeli, Palestinian Jordanian officials. Can you give us any details as to who she'll be meeting with? Any readouts we'll be able to get or any discussions...? [cross talk] Spokesman: Uh... It's a very good question. It's information we should have had... I know she met with a number of Israeli counterparts yesterday, but let me get... I'll try to get a further readout for you. [He later added: USG DiCarlo met on Sunday with Israeli President Isaac Herzog and other senior Israeli officials, including from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She also met with families of hostages being held in Gaza. On Monday, she held further meetings with Israeli interlocutors and UN colleagues on the ground. Tomorrow, 21 November, she is traveling to Ramallah to meet with Palestinian interlocutors.] Serife and then Mike and then we will go to the screen. Question: Thank you, Stéphane. I actually have a follow-up from briefing to you. So during the WHO's briefing, I think it was Mike who said that have the mandate to verify all information that relates to the attacks on healthcare facilities. They publish that information, and they also report that information back to the Secretary-General. And then it's the Secretary-General who has the task, who has the mandate to task, any other bodies such as the ICC (International Criminal Court) to investigate. So, considering that there are about 350 attacks on healthcare facilities since the beginning of the crisis, is the Secretary-General planning to task any bodies like the ICC to investigate? Thank you. Spokesman: I will get back to you on all of the questions you've asked. Because I have to check the legal pathways. That... Mike was talking about things that I was not aware of, but there's a lot of things I'm not aware of so... Mushfique, I have to apologize because I know you wanted to ask a question on Friday, and I ran away quickly. So, go ahead, please. Question: Thanks. Thank you, Stéphane. Very quick. Bangladesh Government announced its election schedule on 7 January in crackdown on opposition and [inaudible] rejected help from the international community for a political solution. I'm wondering what step the Secretary-General is going to take to ensure a free, fair and credible election in Bangladesh. Has Government rejected the international call? Spokesman: We continue to call on all stakeholders, the Government, the political parties to do whatever they can, to promote a peaceful, inclusive, and credible election. Mike, sorry, I skipped you. Didn't I? Sorry. I apologise. [cross talk] Correspondent: Don't worry about it. Spokesman: I feel it's Friday today for some reason, and... Question: Every day is Friday right now; the energy is exhausting. What is the responsibility for UN workers and those affiliated with UN agencies to report Hamas' usage of UN facilities for military purposes? Is there a procedure in place? Who do they go to? And how far up the chain of command? [cross talk] Spokesman: I mean we've had... I would refer you to investigations and reports that were done after... in past conflicts in Gaza, where we reported very transparently what we had found in that regard. The focus right now is, and I think as Rob put it very clearly, is on keeping people safe. But every time there's been investigations after previous conflict, we've been very clear and we've shared with you all of those findings. Question: Are there any adjustments made within, while the conflict is going on? Are there any communications with Hamas after a report of their presence? Spokesman: Well, we have repeatedly called for combatants not to use our facilities, not to fire to our facilities or from our facilities or near our facilities. Stefano? Just a follow-up on this, I know this was asked before, but just to clarify. Let's say if actually Hamas is using some of those facilities. Even just for hiding. And there are children, civilians, family, then there are, instead of finding shelter, what the international law says, can Israel actually shoot at these...? [cross talk] Spokesman: I think you... the international humanitarian law is very clear. And it's not for me to give you a synopsis of it, I would encourage you to read... I would encourage you to read the Geneva Conventions for yourselves. Because I think that's the best way for you to find out. Correspondent: I understand. Spokesman: So we have repeatedly called for premises... UN premises not to be used in combat. But I... as far as what international law says, it's... international law is not a secret. Read it for yourself. Question: No, I understand. But then when he's asked when we ask you, if Israel is committing crime against humanity or war crimes, then the answer that you give is that there will be investigation or there will be... why that, why you can't say if...? Spokesman: Because there will need to be accountability. And I think the Secretary-General answered that specific question when Kirsten asked this morning. Maggie, go ahead. Question: In previous Gaza conflicts, when UNRWA installations have been hit, been damaged, they're... the UN did approach Israel for reparations or compensation, however you want to call it. Will you be doing that again in this conflict? Spokesman: I have no doubt there will be full investigations done in order to have accountability once this conflict is over. Our focus right now is, I mean, in Gaza, for colleagues in Gaza as a humanitarian law. Question: And can you just remind us if Israel ever paid any of that compensation? Spokesman: I will check if there were some discussions. Go ahead, Joe. Go ahead. Correspondent: Okay. I'll make this very quick. Spokesman: Killing won't be painful. Correspondent: No, I wouldn't do that. Spokesman: I'm sorry. I'm kidding. Go ahead Joe. I'm happy to... go ahead Joe. I'm all smiles and all ears. Just briefly, could you give us any update if you have one, on where the negotiations are going with the release of 50 to 70 hostages in return for a four or five day pause? There were reports that, this is very close to being completed, and I assume the UN has had some part in these discussions. Can you just give us a general sense where this stands? Spokesman: No. I won't... for the reason that there's so much writing on this. There are obviously discussions going on, very intensive discussions, but I will leave it at that. Question: Yesterday, in the Secretary-General's statement that you sent out, the last paragraph. He thanked Qatar for their mediation. Was that a direct reference to the hostage negotiations? Spokesman: Well yeah, there's... you know, Secretary-General's been in touch with the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister of Qatar, with the Amir. I mean, it's not a secret that Qatar has been playing a pivotal role on a number of issues, but notably on the issues of hostages. Programming note, this is my Friday because I will not be here until the rest of the week. Farhan [Haq] will be here Tuesday and Wednesday. We're closed on Thursday. Stay away. Friday, we will... unless there is breaking news, we will only post highlights. But we'll have duty team, and we will see you back on Monday. And, hopefully, the SG will have a stakeout on Monday, which means I don't have to brief.","['unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'switzerland', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'palestinianterritories', 'egypt', 'egypt', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'israel', 'yemen', 'bahamas', 'turkey', 'india', 'china', 'chile', 'chile', 'unitedarabemirates', 'niger', 'niger', 'niger', 'mali', 'austria', 'not found', 'france', 'burkinafaso', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'liberia', 'liberia', 'liberia', 'liberia', 'liberia', 'bangladesh', 'qatar', 'qatar', 'qatar']",us,True,False

Instead, Pr… [+5535 chars]",Climate,"Rising sea levels threaten to swamp the Maldives and the Indian Ocean archipelago is already out of drinking water, but the new president says he has scrapped plans to relocate citizens. Instead, President Mohamed Muizzu promises the low-lying nation will beat back the waves through ambitious land reclamation and building islands higher -- policies, however, that environmental and rights groups warn could even exacerbate flooding risks. The upmarket holiday destination is famed for its white sand beaches, turquoise lagoons and vast coral reefs, but the chain of 1,192 tiny islands is on the frontlines of the climate crisis and battling for survival. Former president Mohamed Nasheed began his administration 15 years ago warning citizens they might become the world's first environmental refugees needing relocation to another country. He wanted the Maldives to start saving to buy land in neighbouring India, Sri Lanka or even far away in Australia. But Muizzu, 45, while asking for $500 million in foreign funding to protect vulnerable coasts, said his citizens will not be leaving their homeland. ""If we need to increase the area for living or other economic activity, we can do that,"" Muizzu told AFP, speaking from the crowded capital Male, which is ringed with concrete sea walls. ""We are self-sufficient to look after ourselves"". The tiny nation of Tuvalu this month inked a deal to give citizens the right to live in Australia when their Pacific homeland is lost beneath the seas. But Muizzu said the Maldives would not follow that route. ""I can categorically say that we definitely don't need to buy land or even lease land from any country,"" Muizzu said. Sea walls will ensure risk areas can be ""categorised as a safe island"", he said. But 80 percent of the Maldives is less than a metre (three feet) above sea level. And while fortress-like walls ringing tightly-packed settlements can keep the waves at bay, the fate of the beach islands the tourists come for are uncertain. Tourism accounts for almost one-third of the economy, according to the World Bank. Nasheed's predecessor, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, was the first to ring the alarm of the possible ""death of a nation"", warning the United Nations in 1985 of the threat posed by rising sea levels linked to climate change. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned in 2007 that rises of 18 to 59 centimetres (7.2 to 23.2 inches) would make the Maldives virtually uninhabitable by the end of the century. The warning lights are already flashing red. Gayoom's fear of his country running out of drinking water has already come true, as rising salt levels seep into land, corrupting potable water. ""Every island in the Maldives has run out of fresh water,"" said Shauna Aminath, 38, the environment minister until last week, when Muizzu's government took power. Almost all of the 187 inhabited islets in the archipelago depend on expensive desalination plants, she told AFP. ""Finding ways as to how we protect our islands has been a huge part of how we are trying to adapt to these changes"", Aminath said. The capital Male, where a third of the country's 380,000 citizens are squeezed onto a tiny island, is ""one of the most densely populated pieces of land in the world"" with 65,700 people per square kilometre, according to the environment ministry. A giant sea wall already surrounds the city, but Muizzu said there is potential to expand elsewhere. Reclamation projects have already increased the country's landmass by about 10 percent in the past four decades, using sand pumped onto submerged coral platforms, totalling 30 square kilometres (11 square miles). Muizzu, a British-educated civil engineer and former construction minister for seven years, played a key part in that, overseeing the expansion of the artificial island of Hulhumale. Linked to the capital by a Chinese-built 1.4-kilometre (0.8-mile) bridge, with tower blocks rising high over the blue seas, Hulhumale is double the area of Male, home to about 100,000 people. But environmental and rights groups warn that, while reclamation is needed, it must be done with care. In a recent report, Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused the authorities of failing to implement their own environmental regulations, saying reclamation projects were ""often rushed"" and lacked proper mitigation policies. It gave the example of an airport on Kulhudhuffushi, where 70 percent of the island's mangroves were ""buried"", and a reclamation project at Addu which damaged the coral reefs fisherman depended on. ""The Maldives government has ignored or undermined environmental protection laws, increasing flooding risks and other harm to island communities,"" HRW said. Ahmed Fizal, who heads the environmental campaign group Marine Journal Maldives (MJM), said he feared politicians and businessmen saw shallow lagoons as potential reclamation sites to turn a quick profit. ""You have to ask 'what is the limit, what is the actual cost of reclamation?'"", he said.","['maldives', 'maldives', 'maldives', 'maldives', 'maldives', 'maldives', 'maldives', 'maldives', 'maldives', 'maldives', 'india', 'srilanka', 'australia', 'australia', 'tuvalu']",us,False,False

A storm that hit much of the eastern US earlier this week raised fears of travel chaos for millions of Americans. But the rain and wind is forecast to ease by Wednesday afternoon and is unlikely to disrupt plans for most. Almost 50,000 flights are scheduled to depart on Wednesday. The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) advised travellers to arrive at the airport early given it is the busiest day of the week. It urged passengers to check their flight status in advance because lingering rain and wind could still cause some delays and cancellations. The FAA also said that low cloud and rain could affect some airports in the east; namely in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and around Washington DC. But as of 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) most flights at those airports were departing, or were scheduled to depart, on time. On the roads, rain has caused some flooding in eastern states. There were some delays on the I-95 route from Virginia to Massachusetts on Wednesday due to flooding, but those conditions are expected to clear by the afternoon. Drivers elsewhere have been told to expect trips to take longer than usual due to congestion. ""The day before Thanksgiving is notoriously one of the most congested days on our roadways,"" Bob Pishue, an analyst at INRIX, which provides transportation data, said in a statement. ""Travellers should be prepared for long delays, especially in and around major metros."" The American Automobile Association (AAA) predicted just shy of 50 million people will drive 50 miles (80km) or more during this year's holiday period. This would be the third-highest travel numbers since AAA began tracking holiday travel in 2000 - marking an enthusiastic return to pre-pandemic levels. With the weather expected to improve from Wednesday afternoon, forecasters say most can expect a pleasant Thanksgiving Day. It also means the winds are unlikely to be strong enough to ground the balloons at the Macy's Thanksgiving parade in New York, so Americans and tourists alike can look forward to witnessing the colourful tradition. Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the rain and wind would clear by Thursday. From there, some snowfall is predicted for parts of northern New England and portions of Montana, Wyoming and Idaho. Otherwise, the weather this week is expected to be ""quiet"", Mr Chenard said, with temperatures hovering around typical seasonal levels. ""It should be a pretty nice Thanksgiving for most people,"" he said.","['us', 'us', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates']",gb,False,False

According to the latest research by InsightAce Analytic, theGlobal Hazard Vulnerability Analysis For Healthcare Facilities Marketis expected to witness aCAGR of 7.36%during the forecast period of 2023-2031. Hazard vulnerability analysis (HVA) is a scientific method for pinpointing potential threats to a hospital and its surrounding neighbourhood. The CMS Emergency Preparedness Rule also mandates risk assessments and HVAs. For healthcare facilities to remain accredited and in conformity with government and healthcare regulatory organization norms and standards, comprehensive hazard vulnerability analysis must be implemented. Market expansion can be attributable to expanding healthcare institutions' requirement for integrated risk management systems that involve hazard vulnerability analysis as a major component. Natural disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and wildfires, are becoming more common and more devastating. Healthcare facilities are understanding the significance of doing extensive hazard vulnerability analysis. However, Healthcare institutions must ensure compliance with tight data protection requirements and maintain patient confidentiality at all times, which might delay the implementation of modern technology and data-driven hazard vulnerability analysis solutions. This is because polymer films are slow to decompose and might cause damage to the environment. Free PDF Report Brochure @https://www.insightaceanalytic.com/request-sample/2209 List of Prominent Players in the Hazard Vulnerability Analysis For Healthcare Facilities Market: Hazard Vulnerability Analysis For Healthcare Facilities Market Report Scope: Market Dynamics: Drivers: The growing demand for hazard vulnerability analysis for healthcare facilities is fueled by the increased frequency of severe weather events like hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and wildfires. Healthcare facilities are realizing they require thorough hazard vulnerability analysis to guarantee they are ready for any eventuality. They also implement a complete hazard vulnerability analysis to ensure compliance with the government and healthcare regulatory bodies' stringent norms and regulations for the industry. Challenges: The prime challenge is a lack of awareness and high cost, a shortage of competent individuals, and a lack of norms and protocol because of lockdowns and isolation in emerging countries, which is predicted to slow the growth of the hazard vulnerability analysis for the healthcare facilities market. Smaller healthcare facilities may struggle to afford the high upfront costs of implementing comprehensive hazard vulnerability analysis due to the need to purchase expensive equipment, train staff, and upgrade infrastructure. The efficient adoption and maintenance of comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation techniques in healthcare settings might be hampered by a lack of competent staff in conducting hazard vulnerability analysis and designing effective risk management strategies. After the COVID-19 pandemic, Cybersecurity risks are increasingly being prioritized by healthcare organizations. While supply chain and financial organizations are prime targets for cybercriminals because of their significance to the economy, they are not the only ones that could be attacked. Cybersecurity assaults, such as data breaches, phishing, and ransomware, pose a particularly high risk to the healthcare industry. Regional Trends: The North American hazard vulnerability analysis for the healthcare facilities market is anticipated to register a major market share in revenue. It is projected to grow at a high CAGR in the near future due to technological advancements and affluence. North America dominates the market due to the region's well-established healthcare infrastructure, cutting-edge technology, and widespread awareness of the importance of catastrophe preparedness.

Studies also suggests that women are more affected by climate anxiety than men. The rise of wildfires, floods and droughts around the world are just some of the highly visible signs of climate change. What is reported less is the impact of climate change on human minds. Climate anxiety - defined as feelings of distress about the impacts of climate change - has been reported globally, particularly among children and young people. Data from Google Trends shows that search queries related to ""climate anxiety"" have increased dramatically. Search queries in English around ""climate anxiety"" in the first 10 months of 2023 are 27 times higher than the same period in 2017. There have been surges related to climate anxiety in other world languages over the same period. These are not the languages with the most commonly searched queries around climate anxiety but are just some of the world languages the BBC asked Google to look at. Searches may be higher among speakers of languages with greater awareness of climate anxiety, or among those who use Google most often and do not necessarily suggest that people in countries with bigger shares of search queries are more prone to experiencing climate anxiety. The Google Trends data combines search queries for ""climate anxiety"" and ""eco-anxiety"", terms which are often used in the same way but which have slightly different meanings. Climate anxiety is anxiety specifically associated with awareness of climate change. Eco-anxiety is a more general anxiety associated with awareness of threats to environmental health, including pollution and loss of biodiversity. Google Trends does not simply measure the total volume of searches but looks at a sample of searches to identify trends around the world. It uses a measure called ""search interest"", to look at the relative popularity of search queries over time. Nordic countries had the biggest share of global search queries related to climate anxiety over the past five years. In fact, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway accounted for more than 40% of search queries related to ""climate anxiety"". Google says that its data is adjusted to account for differences in overall search volume, which allows it to compare countries of various population sizes. That's why smaller countries may top the ranking instead of more populated ones. Countries in the Global South - such as Chile, the Philippines and South Africa - represented smaller shares of search queries. Countries with low search volumes have been excluded from the analysis. Google says it has also noted a global increase in search queries about the future of the planet together with queries about the environment in the last 12 months. ""When you look at the kind of queries people are searching for, it's evident that they are seeking understanding, but also wanting to take action,"" a spokesperson said. ""For example, 'how to solve climate change' was one of the trending queries about climate change worldwide in the last two years."" Google data shows a rise in queries about the future together with climate change (up 120%), adaptation (up 120%), sustainability (up 40%) and greenhouse gas emissions (up 120%) in the last 12 months. Trending queries worldwide about climate change include Spanish language searches such as ""cuales son los riesgos del cambio climático?"" or ""what are the risks of climate change?"" (up 150%). Google did not release data on the gender of people searching for queries related to ""climate anxiety"" but research has indicated that women are more predisposed to climate anxiety than men. Findings from a 2023 study published in the academic journal Sustainability, for example, showed that female respondents around the world reported ""greater levels of concern and negative emotions"" about climate change. Male respondents, on the other hand, were ""more optimistic and expressed greater faith in government"". The study was based on an online survey of 10,000 people aged 16 to 25 across 10 countries carried out in 2021. Analysis of more than 44,000 respondents from the European Social Survey in 2019 also concluded that women registered greater concern about climate change than men. Professor Susan Clayton, who co-authored the Sustainability study, has some possible explanations for this. She says that one reason women consistently report higher levels of concern is that they are more open to discussing emotions. ""Women are in general more willing, and may be able to acknowledge their own emotional response [to climate change]. So they seem to think about their emotions, and they are more willing to talk about them, compared to men in general,"" she says. But she also says that some women may worry more about climate change because they are at greater risk than men of experiencing some of the real-life impacts. ""After an extreme weather event you frequently find increased levels of domestic violence, and when people are involuntarily displaced, due to climate change, that opens women to the threat of sexual violence or trafficking,"" she says. ""Also, women are often physiologically vulnerable to climate change. So high temperatures and air pollution can have an impact during pregnancy and the ways pregnancy affects a woman's body may make it more difficult for her to escape extreme climate conditions."" There is some research which suggests women are more likely than men to die in climate change-related disasters. For example, a study looking at cyclones in Bangladesh between 1983 and 2009 suggested that women had an increased mortality risk compared to the general adult population. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says it's likely that humans have contributed to the increased intensity of some cyclones. Professor Clayton says that gender-based inequalities mean that some women in poorer countries may lack access to information following a climate change event. They are less likely to be able to travel to a place of safety, and may have caring responsibilities that mean they prioritise the safety of others over themselves. Indirect and longer-term impacts of climate change can also be detrimental to the wellbeing of women and girls. ""Some studies have shown that girls are married earlier when the family is facing economic pressures associated with the changing conditions of climate change. ""For example, maybe agriculture is threatened by droughts or floods and so because of their economic constraints families want to marry off their daughters, so they don't have to feed the daughters themselves,"" Professor Clayton adds. In 2022, the IPCC reported on the mental health impacts of climate change for the first time. This year's COP28 in Dubai will also feature several discussions about mental health. Just as the physical impacts of climate change are on the rise, so too is the attention paid to its impacts on the mind.

Tacloban, The Philippines– Twice a month for the last 10 years, pig farmer Alejandro Sumayang has planted mangrove plants along the shoreline a few metres from his home. Pushing a stick into the muddy ground, he creates a hole for the seedling, tying it to a piece of bamboo to prevent the tide from washing it away. “This is what shields me,” he said, crouching to inspect a recently planted row of plants. The back of Sumayang’s makeshift house faces the Pacific Ocean in the Philippines’s central Leyte province. Ten years ago, on November 8, 2013, tsunami-like waves whipped up bySuper Typhoon Haiyancrashed into his home in Silago, leaving only broken wooden beams standing amid the wreckage. Haiyanwas one of the strongest typhoons ever to make landfall. More than 6,300 people were killed as the storm swept across the island of Leyte, flattening homes and causing a storm surge that swamped entire neighbourhoods. The government said at least 13 million people were affected. Leyte wasstruck againby a typhoon in December 2021. Typhoon Rai rivalled Haiyan’s intensity. “I’d have lost my house again if we hadn’t planted anything. From afar we could see the waves losing their momentum, breaking apart before they reached the shore,” Sumayang told Al Jazeera. About 20 typhoons a year enter Philippine territory. For the last 12 years, the Southeast Asian archipelago has kept the top spot for the most vulnerable and at-risk country for natural disasters in theWorld Risk Indexproduced by Germany’s Ruhr University Bochum. In Haiyan’s wake, several coastal communities began mangrove reforestation efforts, arguing nature was the most effective way to deal with the effects of climate change. Four villages in Silago were among the first to start, working with NGOs and village officials to begin planting a year after the disaster. The characteristic bulbous roots and flat leaves of the varying types of mangrove now line 215sq km (83 sq miles) of the town’s coastal area. The Leyte Center for Development (LCDE), a humanitarian organisation which supported the planting in Silago, believes the plants helped save 2,000 coastal residents from Rai’s onslaught. “It is a testament to the effectiveness of an eco-systems-based approach and it cost the people practically nothing,” said the LCDE’s director Minet Aguisanda-Jerusalem. There has been little support from any officials at the municipal level or above, however. The government has instead backed man-made interventions including a vast concrete sea wall in Tacloban City, Leyte’s capital. Construction on the 16.9 billion Philippine peso ($304.5m) Storm Surge Protection Project (SSPP) began in 2016. The 44.48km (27.6 miles) long concrete seawall was supposed to have been finished by 2020 but only 58 percent of the work has been done. Delays have been caused by “Right-Of-Way Acquisitions, fluctuating prices of materials [and] request of additional features in the tide embankment”, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) regional office told Al Jazeera in an email. Along some sections of the SSPP, the wall has already started to crack and crumble, exposing the steel rebars inside to the elements. But the DPWH is standing by the project. In a report it shared with Al Jazeera, it advised engineering offices on the island “to adopt the SSPP standards in protecting their shores all over the region”. Professor William Holden, an environmental geographer from the University of Calgary who is studying the situation in Tacloban, says that even when the wall is finished, it will probably not be enough to protect the city. “Climate change means warmer air holding more water and thus heavier rainfall events. So there’s no way engineers can predict how big of a seawall to build. Future typhoons will eventually dwarf Haiyan,” said Holden, who suspects the maintenance of the SSPP will also prove costly. Jon Bonifacio, the national coordinator for the environmental advocacy group Kalikasan, worries the wall could even exacerbate the effects of climate change, because it risks trapping any water that enters the city during a storm and causing prolonged flooding. He is also critical of the social cost of the project, which required thousands of coastal residents to leave their homes, separating them from their livelihoods. He faults the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr for continuing the state’s “obsession with grey infrastructure” as it “ends up displacing impacts rather than eliminating climate change impacts”. The Philippines is home to 46 of the world’s 70 species of mangrove trees and shrubs, which thrive in the tidal saltwater shallows where the land meets the sea. While research has shown the plants help reduce coastal communities’ vulnerability to tsunamis and storm surges, they are also under threat. The Philippines is estimated to have lost about 49 percent of its mangrove forests since 1920. Professor Eduardo Mangaoang, the founder of the Regional Climate Change R&D Center at Visayas State University in Leyte, urged authorities to heed the beneficial science behind mangroves. “The stems and bodies are a natural breakwater system against strong waves. It stabilises and holds shoreline soil together and is a nursery for fish,” Mangaoang explained to Al Jazeera. In 2014, Jecel Espina-Pedel, a 14-year-old from Silago and a self-described “nature lover”, joined the hundreds of others in a coordinated mangrove planting effort. Gazing out of her window, she remembers seeing the first leaves sprout in just six months. Within a few years, the surrounding soil was totally transformed. “The ground went from rocky to muddy. We could see small holes which were new habitats. We looked under rocks and saw fish we’d never seen here before,” she explained, still thrilled by what happened. Pedel comes from a family of fisherfolk. Before long, they were often eating shellfish for dinner and selling the rest of their catch by the roadside. “It has multiple co-benefits: food sources, science-based, and it creates a carbon sink. It’s internationally recognised. But locally, there isn’t a comprehensive plan for this,” Gerry Arances, the director of the Center for Energy, Ecology and Development in Manila, told Al Jazeera. For mangroves to survive, the correct varieties of seedlings must be chosen and placed properly along the shore. In 2015, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) drew flak for using improper methods in a 1 billion Philippine peso ($18m) mangrove reforestation project. In 2023, advocates againcriticisedthe department for repeating the mistake in Bohol and Negros Occidental. Mangaoang attributes the success in areas like Silago to the attention of local residents who continue planting while keeping the mangroves free of barnacles and other parasites. The academic travels all over the region promoting mangroves. In his town of Baybay, Leyte, he finally convinced Mayor Jose Carlos Cari to support a community mangrove plan for next year, a first for the region. Overall, Mangaoang says, community-coordinated mangrove planting is “still at the early stages. Coastal communities have a lot of local practices that need support. They themselves are scientists, they just don’t know it.” The government, however, continues to expand its engineering interventions in Leyte. In February of this year, construction began on the Tacloban City Causeway. According to the DPWH, the 4.5 billion Philippine peso ($81.1m) 2.5km (1.5 miles) road will reduce city travel time and “protect the life and property of the residents/constituents in the area from erosive tidal actions”. The road embankment will be built on reclaimed land. That entails bulldozing the mangroves along Cancabato Bay, classified as a protected area by the city for its biodiversity. The bay is a popular fishing ground and its mangrove density was increased by the local fishing community after Haiyan. “There needs to be proper planning around these issues,” said Ian Fry, the United Nations special rapporteur on the protection of human rights in the context of climate change, after visiting Tacloban during the 10th-year commemoration of Haiyan. He called the potential loss of mangroves a “serious concern”. Roque Regis, a bay area community leader, estimates their own efforts have added an extra 30 percent to the bay’s mangroves since Haiyan. He called the government “deaf” for ignoring its own protections over the bay and residents’ pleas to halt construction. After the typhoon, “they displaced everyone living near the coast”, Regis told Al Jazeera. “Now they’re set to do the same in Cancabato Bay. They want to ‘clean up’ the area for tourists. But they’re taking down our homes and our fishing grounds.” With the Philippine government’s response to climate disaster unfinished, affected communities remain convinced that the solution to future problems remains with nature. They plan to persist in their defence of the trees that they believe both save and nurture them. “There were doubters when we started planting, saying the mangroves would be home to snakes, or that they wouldn’t work. But look at us here, we are protected. This is a gift to the people,” said Sumayang.

Paul Gilbert found his mother Maureen, 83, dead in flood water inside her home in Chesterfield last month. He said said the street was trying to come to terms with the tragedy but had been ""let down"" by the council's response. Chesterfield Borough Council said it was supporting residents. Mr Gilbert, who has being trying to clear up the wreckage in the home in Tapton Terrace, where his mother lived all her life, said: ""It's horrible being down here. ""It's taking too long [for help] to come through. You're having to ring the council up to get them to come and collect rubbish. ""It's very difficult. We are having to fight for everything. We have been let down again."" The street flooded when the nearby River Rother burst its banks during heavy rain and water swept into 26 properties. Some residents said insurance companies had been so busy they had been unable to send loss adjusters to survey damage. Mrs Gilbert's neighbour, Stephanie Winnard, said she was still in the process of getting her house dried out after it was deluged by 5ft (1.5m) of water. She said: ""It's absolutely devastating. It's still very stressful. It hits you so hard every time you come in and you see your house in a state like this."" Businesses in the town are also counting the cost of the flooding. The cellar and ground floor of the Anchor pub, in Factory Street, was submerged during the storm and had to close for a week. Joint owner Layonie Rawson said previous issues with flooding had made it impossible to get insurance. She said: ""We had loss of revenue and repairs and replacing equipment and we are pushing around £20,000 [of costs]. ""We just had to crack on. We are really lucky we have had a support form friends and family and members of the community. Everyone just chipped in. ""We have even had help from people we don't know turning up with packages of cleaning supplies even food parcels."" Leader of Chesterfield Borough Council Tricia Gilby said: ""This has been an incredibly challenging period for the town and borough but Chesterfield is a resilient place, and our communities pull together like no other at such times. ""Over the last month we have been supporting our residents and businesses with the huge clean-up, and providing emergency and temporary housing for those affected by flood damage."" She said eight households were still in emergency accommodation following the flooding and that financial aid was available for residents and businesses through the council.

Then the floods. In the small village of Sesklo in central Greece, 46-year-old Vasilis Tsiamitas has felt the extremes of both freak weather phenomena this summer, as Greece has become a climate change hotspot. Storm Elias flooded his house, damaged his beach bar and swept away his car in September. That finished off what was left weeks earlier by Storm Daniel, Greece’s most intense on record, and a July wildfire that scorched his family’s almond grove. “God only knows how I will get past this,” said Tsiamitas, standing outside his two-storey family house. The front door is off its hinges, propped up against a wall next to wooden boards soaked by floodwater. “What else could hit me? It can’t get any worse,” he said. Fierce storms and floods have become more frequent in recent years, while rising temperatures make summers hotter and drier, creating tinder-box conditions for wildfires. Muddy roads and household furniture, stacked up outside to dry, in villages across the central mainland region of Thessaly are a constant reminder of the steps Greece needs to take as it adapts to climate change and seeks to mitigate the effects of such freak weather events. Sesklo, a village of about 800 residents near the port city of Volos, and home to one of Europe’s oldest prehistoric settlements, has survived natural disasters through the centuries. But its oldest residents, Tsiamitas says, have never experienced anything like this year’s devastation. “It’s the first time that our village is tested so much,” said Tsiamitas, who is also the local community leader. “We have elderly people sitting at the village square who are 95 years old. They have never experienced such a thing before.” The wildfire that broke out in July was burning uncontrolled for at least two days. Sesklo residents were evacuated in time but the flames, fanned by strong winds, burned through farmland and groves, destroying approximately 70 percent of the village’s almond and olive oil production, said Tsiamitas. “The weather conditions were so bad, the wind, there was no humidity that day, the fire was moving fast. There was not enough time to do anything,” he said. In early September, Storm Daniel hit Thessaly after Greece’s longest heatwave in more than 30 years. It killed 16 people and turned the area into an inland sea, destroying homes, farms and wiping out swaths of crops. Tsiamitas, whose beach bar flooded, said most Sesklo residents were not as badly affected as others in the wider region. But their feeling of relief was short-lived. Weeks later, Elias, a less intense but unexpected storm, was the final straw. Tsiamitas recounts that he had his youngest son in his arms when a raging torrent flung his front door open, forcing him to race upstairs where his in-laws live. Since then, the water has subsided, revealing the devastation that villages like Sesklo suffered. “We should learn our lesson,” Tsiamitas said, looking at stumps of burned almond trees. “We need to uproot them … we need to plant them again. Again and again, we need to start everything from scratch.” Follow Al Jazeera English:","['greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece', 'greece']",us,False,False

Here, in photos and in her own words, she captures the increasing threat climate change poses to the lives and livelihoods of the Ladakhi people, who face an uncertain future below the melting glaciers of the Himalayan mountains. Kumar-Rao is one of this year's Climate Pioneers on the BBC 100 Women list. The night of 5 August 2010 is still fresh in the memory of the people of Ladakh, in northern India, when it felt like a cloud had burst over the area surrounding the capital, Leh. One year's worth of rain fell on the cold desert in just two apocalyptic hours. Massive walls of sludge swallowed up everything in their path. Scrambling people were buried mid-stride under a thick brown-grey mass. Several hundred people were never found after that fateful night. The Ladakh region, the northernmost plateau of India, sits more than 3,000m (9,850ft) above sea level. The Greater Himalayan Range shields the region from the annual monsoon that much of the rest of India relies on. Until recently, Ladakh has been bathed by the sun for 300 days per year, while barely four inches of rain have fallen on the vast landscape of rock and mountains. Floods were virtually unheard of. The destructive flood of 2010 was followed in quick succession by further floods in 2012, 2015, and most recently, in 2018. Something that had not happened in seven decades, occurred four times in fewer than 10 years. Such freak weather events are a result of climate change, experts say. A decade and a half ago there used to be a regular rhythm to the Ladakhi land, which provided villagers with a steady water supply. Winter snow melted to feed streams, just as meltwater from the glaciers trickled down and provided water for farming and agriculture in springtime. However, climate change has seen average winter temperatures in Ladakh rise by about 1C over the last 40 years. Snowfall has become increasingly unpredictable and glaciers have retreated farther up towards the peaks, or disappeared altogether. I first visited Ladakh in 2018. I returned in 2019, and again in spring this year - kept away in the interim by the coronavirus pandemic. The difference was startling. The snow now melts faster, leaving villagers with little to no water by spring. Glaciers are now so high up in the mountains that they melt later in the year. Ladakhi springtime - once lush and fertile - was dry and silent this year. A lack of water has led to a decrease in meadows - keeping large flocks of pashmina goats is becoming unviable. The Changpa herders are giving up their traditional livelihoods and migrating to other parts of India or to Leh looking for non-pastoral work. Farmers, unable to find water for their barley and apricots, are leaving in droves. Despite the destruction caused by climate change, there is hope for this isolated region. On my second visit to Ladakh in March 2019, I met engineer Sonam Wangchuk. He told me that on a drive through the valleys in 2013 he noticed a large mound of unmelted ice under a bridge, sheltered from the sun. The sight of that small tower of ice triggered an idea. ""High school maths tells us that a cone is the simple answer,"" he grinned at me. Wangchuk wanted to help villagers freeze water in winter which could be saved for use in spring. Freezing it in the shape of a cone would maximise the volume of ice per square metre of surface area exposed to the sun and lengthen the amount of time it would take to melt. The engineer assembled a team of local people and began experimenting, looking for the best way of creating cones of ice. Eventually, they found the right formula. After piping water from a mountain stream down into the valley, the group forced water to flow up a vertical pipe with a fine nozzle attached to its end. The water went up the pipe and exited via the nozzle as a fine spray. In night-time temperatures of -30C, the spray froze as it exited the pipe. Gradually, as more and more water emerged as spray and turned to ice, the edifice began to resemble a cone. Now named ice stupas, after Buddhist places of meditation, they have gained popularity all across Ladakh. The structures, some of which tower over 100ft (30m), provide a water supply for a community that has seen climate change disrupt its natural resources. They also provide a surprising source of entertainment - hotly contested competitions for the tallest stupa take place annually. But the injustice of the situation is not lost on either Wangchuk or his stupa-building friends. Ladakhi people are paying the price for carbon emissions made elsewhere. ""It is not enough that we keep coming up with technical innovations, keep adapting, keep solving problems,"" Wangchuk tells me. ""I want to use ice stupas as much to sensitise the world about the need for a change in behaviour, as I want to use it to provide water for us."" As a photographer who has travelled across vast spaces of South Asia, I know Ladakh is not alone in its fight. For the first time in history India and its neighbouring countries, China and Pakistan, face a common enemy - climate change. It has the potential to destroy river basins and threaten the most populated regions of the world. It may be time to come together to shore up resilience against this threat to survival.

At a camp for internally displaced people on the outskirts of Baidoa city in southwest Somalia, Halima Abdi, 57, walks through the flooded compound to access her makeshift house. It is partly submerged in the water, which had forced her to leave the previous day. Most of her neighbours have left to seek shelter in Baidoa and, as she stands in the almost-empty camp of scattered shanty houses, she checks to see what is left after the flood swept away her belongings. “We were forced to flee after three days of heavy rain that almost took our lives,” Abdi, a single mother of seven children told Al Jazeera. “We are left with nothing but just the pillars of the house, and the floods swept away all our goods including the utensils, mattress and clothes. I have rescued my children and taken them to a different house in the town.” Early last year, Abdi sought refuge at the camp to get aid after a severe drought destroyed their maize farm in Manaas village, about 45km (28 miles) south of Baidoa and could barely get anything to feed her children. It was the worst drought the Horn of Africa had experienced in four decades. Since then, she has been dependent on aid in the form of food and medicine to survive. Today, her fortunes have been dampened again. “We couldn’t plant anything due to the failed rainfall in four consecutive seasons and that is why we come to the camp looking for a better life. Now it has rained heavily and my makeshift house isn’t there any more and I literally have to swim back when accessing the main road,” she added. Climate change has upended lives and livelihoods across the region in the last two years. The United Nations has said 4.3 million people, a quarter of Somalia’s population, are at risk of “crisis-level hunger or worse” this year due to drought and floods. Kevin Mackey, Somalia country director of the NGO World Vision, has said children are among the most affected groups and are now “at increased risk of illness”. With these floods following right after the dry spell, the most vulnerable people in Somalia have been hit once again by the latest shocks in a continuing climate crisis. In Dolow town, approximately 250km (155 miles) from where Abdi lives, Heyba Shirar and her four children live in her relative’s house with nowhere else to go. “I have nothing to feed my children with, I used to run a small restaurant but it’s no longer operational due to the floods and the cost of living is very high since the roads are impassable.” Shirar, 28, told Al Jazeera. “No clean water to drink and all the water storage is destroyed. Also, all the sewage system is ruined and the number of people falling sick is increasing. I also got sick and I was diagnosed with malaria, we are suffering, we kindly ask for help.” Many Somalis attribute floods and drought to God’s action but analysts have said the unusually heavy rains were triggered by the El Nino phenomenon, the periodic warming of surface waters in the Pacific. According to the country’s disaster management agency SoDMA, the torrential rains have affected nearly 1.5 million people in South-Central and caused the death of at least50 people. Its data shows that 687,235 people in the Gedo, Hiraan, Bay and Bakool regions were forced to flee their houses, as floodwaters swept away key bridges and destroyed up to 6,000 houses. More rain is forecast between November 21-24 and is expected to cause more destruction. The government says it has made efforts to address the current crisis and delivered humanitarian aid to some affected areas. Somali government spokesperson Farhan Mohamed Jimale told Al Jazeera that food aid, mosquito nets and other relief materials have been delivered to 4,500 families displaced by the rains. “We have also initiated lifesaving programmes which includes deployment of dozens of boats where bridges are destroyed,” he said, adding that there are ongoing partnerships with aid organisations who are also responding as the situation unfolds. However, the effects of the climate crisis remain widespread across Somalia. In Beledweyne, an agricultural town about 350km (217 miles) northwest of the capital Mogadishu, the downpour ruined countless hectares of farmlands, some of which are still flooded. The flash floods from the river also displaced thousands of families who are now surviving on anything they can find. “The water level is reaching my chest and all over the residential [area] is flooded and inaccessible. I was forced to flee with my children and took them to higher ground. Literally, my children are sleeping on the ground [during] this cold and raining period.” Abdikadir Abdullahi Mohamed, 60, a father of three in Beledeweyne told Al Jazeera. “I had a grocery store and a farm and all was swept away by the floods,” he added. “I have lost about $2,000 and still continue to count the loss; we are suffering. It’s just now that we were hoping to plant and harvest given the drought over the years but it’s over.” According to the United Nations, countries like Somalia – which contributes 0.03 percent of total global emissions – are being disproportionately affected by climate change. It is a topic that was debated at the Africa Climate Summit in Kenya in September and is expected to again be discussed as world leaders gather in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for COP28, the UN Climate Change Conference, from November 30 – December 12. Meanwhile, the Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) – a body tasked with climate forecasts – of the regional bloc IGAD has warned that the effects of climate change are becoming more severe, frequent and widespread with far-reaching consequences for the region. The centre says the region lacks an active multi-stakeholder coordination mechanism for the preparation of resources based on climate data and tools for early warning, alerts and disaster triggers. “At an average global warming level of above 1.1 degree Celsius – and the region warms faster than this average – more climate change impacts are likely,” Guleid Artan, the director at ICPAC told Al Jazeera. Artan added that for resilience during recurrent and severe climate-related hazards, people need early warning information from real-time monitoring by government agencies. That is missing and could take time to put into place. “There is [the] need to build back better and not resettle people in lowlands and flood-prone areas,” he said. “An integrated approach on land and environmental restoration and rehabilitating degraded landscapes including tree planting will help to reduce disasters in the medium and long run.” For now, Abdi, despite the situation around her, is still hopeful. “There is nothing we can do, I hope and pray that we overcome this, return to our farming activities and recover from the disaster,” she said.

Flash floods from the Tana River in Garissa, a county on the border with Somalia, forced the 42-year-old fruit vendor to flee at night from her submerged home built from mud and corrugated metal sheets to the nearest dry land with her family of 12, including seven children. They are among thousands of people left homeless and destitute by torrential rains that have lashed much of Kenya, killing more than 70 people. The Horn of Africa – only slowly emerging from a devastating drought that left millions hungry – is experiencing heavy rainfall and floods linked to the El Nino weather phenomenon. The latest disaster has claimed dozens of lives and caused large-scale displacement in Kenya as well asSomaliaand Ethiopia. “The waters have ruined everything,” a distressed Gumo said as she folded her soaked hijab, oblivious to the health risks from the overflowing pit latrine next to her. “My life is in a very bad state right now.” At a camp for the displaced hurriedly set up near an aid agency’s warehouse in the heart of Garissa town, Mwana Juma Hassan sat outside her white domed tent, her eyes downcast. “Eating here has become a luxury,” she said. “We don’t know when we will eat the next meal.” It is the fourth time the 37-year-old widow has been displaced by floods in less than a decade, and the latest downpour has washed away her watermelon farm – her only source of income. Along with her teenage daughter, Hassan said they plan to return home after the water recedes, fearing starvation at the camp.

Now they say they have nowhere to hide from intense flooding as rainfall exacerbated by the weather phenomenon El Niño pummels large parts of Somalia. Floods have killed at least 96 people, the country’s Council of Ministers said Thursday. Among the worst hit towns is the densely populated Beledweyne, where the Shabelle River has burst its banks, destroyed many homes and caused thousands to flee to higher ground near the border withEthiopia. Hakima Mohamud Hareed, a mother of four children including one who is disabled, said that her family constantly looks for shelter. The family recently moved to Beledweyne, fleeing battles between the extremist group al-Shabab and Somali government forces. “We left our home in search of safety and stability, but little did we know that we would end up facing another calamity,"" she said by phone. In the displacement camp of Kutiimo in Beledweyne, the floods destroyed the family's small, tattered tent. Wind lashes the damp and flimsy fabric. “The floods washed away all our belongings, so we were left only with our lives,"" she said. “It was a traumatic experience for all of us."" They aren't alone. According to the humanitarian group Save the Children, the flooding has forced an estimated 250,000 people, or 90% of Beledweyne's population, out of their homes. Somalia's federal government declared a state of emergency in October after extreme weather exacerbated by El Niño destroyed homes, roads and bridges. An El Niño is a natural, temporary and occasional warming of part of the Pacific that shifts weather patterns across the globe, often by moving the airborne paths for storms. It hits hardest in December through February. Scientists believe climate change is making El Niño stronger. Many parts of Somalia, as well as in neighboring Horn of Africa nations Kenya and Ethiopia, are still receiving torrential rainfall in what aid agencies have described as a rare flooding phenomenon. The U.N.-backed Somali Water and Land Information Management project has warned of “a flood event of a magnitude statistically likely only once in 100 years,"" the U.N. food agency said in a recent statement. About 1.6 million people in Somalia could be affected by flooding events in the rainy season lasting until December, it said. Beledweyne, in the central region of Hiran, may be the most devastated community. As floodwaters swept through, homes were washed away. Hakima said that her family may be safe from flooding in their camp, but they are hungry and desperate for warm shelter. “We ask our Somali brothers and sisters to help us get out of this situation, as we are struggling to survive,” she said. Mukhtar Moalim, the owner of a retail shop, described frantic attempts to save his property in Beledweyne's market after the river burst its banks. He and a relative swam towards the shop to try to prevent the water from flowing in, putting concrete blocks against the door. But the water level keeps rising, also threatening their residence on the floor above the shop from which they monitor the destruction. At least 53 people have been killed by flooding across Somalia, said Hassan Issee, who manages emergency operations at the Somalia Disaster Management Agency. “The situation is grave, and we are doing our best to provide relief to the affected people,” he said. Mogadishu, the Somali capital, has also been affected. The city's main streets, including the road to the airport, have flooded. Speaking on Wednesday in the Dollow district of Gedo region, where many families have been displaced by flooding, Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre urged the international community to help. “We are doing our best, but we need more support,” he said. ___ Follow AP's Africa coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/africa","['somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'not found', 'kenya', 'ethiopia']",us,False,False

Peru holds 68% of the world's tropical glaciers and warming temperatures have led to melting and the creation of new mountain lagoons that risk overflowing and flooding, the National Institute of Research of Mountain Glaciers and Ecosystems said. The report uses satellite imagery until 2020 and shows that 2,084 glaciers are covering 1,050 square kilometres (405 square miles) in Peru, compared to the 2,399 square kilometers of ice and snow in 1962. ""In four years, from 2016 to 2020 we have lost almost 6% of these high mountain glaciers,"" Beatriz Fuentealba, the institute's director, said from the Ancash region where many glaciers have disappeared. According to the inventory, 164 lagoons have been formed or are in the process of formation in the last four years, bringing the number of glacial lagoons up to 8,466, covering about 1,081 square kilometres. ""The new lagoons could be, in the future, water reserves, but being at high altitudes they cause a danger of overflowing and flooding,"" said Jesus Gomez, director of research on glaciers at the Ministry of the Environment . Nearly all of Peru's tropical glaciers are above 6,000 meters (19,685 feet) above sea level while the new lagoons are at an altitude of between 4,000 and 5,000 meters, the report said. Almost 20 million Peruvians benefit directly or indirectly from the water that comes down from the glaciers, according to the report. ""This means that we have lost more than half of our water reserves,"" said Environment Minister Albina Ruiz, noting that glacial retreat is impacting the natural mountain ecosystem. ""Although we cannot prevent glaciers from disappearing over the years, we can reduce the speed at which they are being lost,"" she said, calling for less pollution, more green areas and ""above all, recognizing that the mountain provides us with life.""

The Horn of Africa has had five failed rainy seasons since 2019, according to the UN. The US and UN suspended aid earlier this year after allegations of theft, worsening the humanitarian crisis. Tigray is recovering from a two-year civil war which ended a year ago, while a conflict has erupted in Amhara. About 46 people died in the town of Yechila in Tigray, while six died in the neighbouring Amhara region of Wag Hemra, because of food shortages, the officials said. Over 4,000 cattle have died because of severe drought. As northern Ethiopia battles drought, the country's southern and eastern regions have been deluged by flash floods. In a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, the UN said that more than 370,000 people had fled their homes because of the floods. At least 43 people have been killed by the flooding and landslides in the eastern Somali region. During the war in Tigray, the region was cut off from humanitarian aid, leading to an unknown number of deaths. But it has been estimated that about 500,000 people may have died as a result of war, lack of medical supplies and hunger amid what were described as ""famine-like conditions"". The conflict ended after the Ethiopian government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) signed a peace deal brokered by the African Union (AU). After the conflict ended, there was a steady flow of aid until June, when the US and UN paused humanitarian assistance, staying it had been systematically stolen by corrupt officials. The US says widespread food deliveries will be resumed in December after significant reforms had been made to ensure that the supplies reached those who needed it most. Across East Africa, heavy rains and flash flooding have killed 130 people in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia in recent weeks, according to the Associated Press. The UN has described them as a ""once-in-a-century event"". In a statement, Fati N'Zi-Hassane, Oxfam in Africa Director said, the region was ""going from one disaster to the next as climatic shocks become more frequent and intense"". Somalia has been especially hit hard by the floods, after suffering from catastrophic droughts in recent years. The worst hit town is Beledweyne, where the Shabelle River burst its banks. The El Nino phenomenon has greatly affected East Africa. It is caused by warming in the Pacific Ocean and is linked to flooding, cyclones, drought and wildfires. Not all droughts or floods are due to climate change, but excess heat in the atmosphere is drawing more moisture out of the earth and making droughts worse, while a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.","['ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'sweden', 'sweden', 'kenya', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'somalia']",gb,False,False

The crop is harvested twice annually—October to March for the main crop and a May to August mid-crop.On a hot November morning, a squad of trucks arrived from the plantations to drop off a few dozen bags of beans at the Scappen cooperative in the village of Hermankono, near the central southern town of Divo, some 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the economic capital Abidjan.""It's rained too much this year. Usually at this time, trucks are queueing up to unload. Here, we have barely 200 bags whereas we could stock 10 times as many,"" complained Sylla, chairman of the cooperative grouping some 1,500 planters.He expects harvest volume to drop some three to four times on last year's.A look in the fields nearby suggests that fear is well-founded. And Analysts confirm as much.""Traders are worried about another short production year and these feelings have been enhanced by El Niño that could threaten West Africa crops with hot and dry weather later this year,"" said Jack Scoville of Price Futures Group.The analyst warned of ""tight supplies"" amid ""more reports of reduced arrivals in Ivory Coast and Ghana,"" the number two global producer.The rains are set to see harvest volume come in some three to four times down on last year.By a dirt track which only motorbikes could thread their way along, Bamoussa Coulibaly collected a few rare yellow-red pods from the many cocoa trees.July was a particularly rainy month in Ivory Coast's south, just as the cocoa plants were flowering. As a result, ""the flowers fell,"" the farm worker said as he explained his meager harvest.Of those cocoa pods which resisted, some rotted anyway in the excessive humidity.Rainfall soarsSome areas have seen rainfall this year between 20 and even 40 percent above the 1991-2020 norm, according to data from national meteorological service Sodexam.To blossom fully, cocoa needs a subtle alternation between sunshine and rain.A few kilometers from Hermankono, in the bush near N'Douci, Monique Koffi Amenan waded through a marshy field resulting from weeks of rainfall which caused the neighboring river to burst its banks.""This year, what we've harvested won't even fill one bag, instead of the usual two. The rain has rotted the cocoa,"" explained the planter in her 40s who has spent a decade working the area with her husband.""We'd forecast a 20 percent drop on last year and our forecasts are confirmed. With the heavy rains, many pods have rotted,"" Yves Brahima Kone, who heads Ivorian regulator the Coffee-Cocoa Council (CCC), told AFP.Workers pile sacks of cocoa beans at the warehouse of Hermankono cooperative.Prices soar tooWith a 40 percent share of global supply, Ivory Coast is the world's top producer ahead of neighboring Ghana, whose production has recently suffered from cocoa swollen shoot virus disease, as well as illegal mining on some cocoa farms.Anticipating a poor crop, Ivory Coast suspended export contracts—some two-thirds of produce usually goes to the EU bloc—back in July.As a result of that move, cocoa prices have soared on commodity markets beyond $4,000 a ton in New York, a level not seen in more than four decades, since 1978.It was a similar story in London, with a ton fetching £3,478 on November 10, a post-1989 record and up 70 percent on January.The situation threatens to remain critical with the resurgence of the El Niño climate phenomenon threatening western Africa.""This is proof that climate change is hitting developing countries hardest,"" said Ivorian economist Seraphin Prao.Even ahead of expected further El Niño woe next year, producers are already fretting over their short-term financial health.The World Bank says the commodity provides income for around one in five Ivorians.In Ivory Coast, the government sets cocoa prices. At 1,000 CFA francs per kilogram (1.50 euros, $1.70) it is higher this year than in recent seasons, but low volumes will eat into many producer families' revenues.Cocoa provides a wage for around one in five Ivorians—some six million people—according to the World Bank.""My children are school age—but if cocoa doesn't deliver, how shall we manage?"" Amenan worried.""In a liberalized system, farmers would be winners in the current context, as cocoa (prices) reach record levels. In Cameroon, for example, where the price is not set by the state, a kilo of cocoa sells for twice as much,"" said economist Prao.Back at the Hermankono cooperative, Siaka Sylla is pinning his hopes on a better intermediate harvest next April.""But that won't make up for our losses,"" he said.","['ctedivoire', 'ctedivoire', 'ctedivoire', 'ctedivoire', 'ctedivoire', 'ctedivoire', 'ctedivoire', 'ctedivoire', 'guinea', 'france', 'ghana', 'ghana', 'unitedstates', 'unitedkingdom']",gb,True,False

The team found that most of the ancient wood came from yew trees that populated the area between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago.These trees, which are a nuisance when they jam farming equipment during plowing, contain a treasure trove of perfectly preserved information about what the Fens looked like thousands of years ago.The Fen yew woodlands suddenly died about 4,200 years ago, when the trees fell into peat and were preserved. The researchers hypothesize that a rapid sea level rise in the North Sea flooded the area with salt water, causing the vast woodlands to disappear.The climate and environmental information these trees contain could be a valuable clue in determining whether this climate event could be related to other events that happened elsewhere in the world at the same time, including a megadrought in the Middle East that may have been a factor in the collapse of ancient Egypt's Old Kingdom. The researchers have published their findings inQuaternary Science Reviews.Credit: Tatiana BebchukYew trees (Taxus baccata) are one of the longest-lived species in Europe, and can reach up to 20 meters in height. While these trees are fairly common in Cambridge College gardens and churchyards across southern England, they are absent in the Fens, the low-lying marshy region of eastern England. Much of the Fens was a wetland until it was drained between the 17th and 19th centuries using artificial drainage and flood protection. Today, the area is some of the most productive farmland in the U.K., thanks to its rich peat soil.While the area is great for farming and does have its own charms, few people would describe the Fens as spectacular: for the most part, the area is extremely flat and dominated by fields of potatoes, sugar beet, wheat and other crops. But 5,000 years ago, the area was a huge forest.""A common annoyance for Fenland farmers is getting their equipment caught on big pieces of wood buried in the soil, which can often happen when planting potatoes, since they are planted a little deeper than other crops,"" said lead author Tatiana Bebchuk, a Ph.D. student from Cambridge's Department of Geography. ""This wood is often pulled up and piled at the edge of fields: it's a pretty common sight to see these huge piles of logs when driving through the area.""For farmers, these logs are a nuisance. But for Bebchuk and her colleagues, they are buried treasure. The Cambridge team approached several Fenland farmers and took samples of hundreds of logs that had been dug up and discarded, to find out what secrets they might hold.Inner part of the pile of subfossil yew trunks. Note fresh chain-saw cuts after sampling cross-sectional disks. Credit: Tatiana Bebchuk""I remember when I first saw this enormous pile of abandoned trees, it was incredible just how many there were,"" said Bebchuk. ""But when we got them back to lab, we were even more surprised: these trees were so well-preserved, it looked as if they were cut down just yesterday.""To put current anthropogenic climate change in a long-term context of natural variability, scientists need accurate evidence from the past, and trees are some of the best recorders of past conditions: their annual growth rings contain information about temperature and hydroclimate for every growing season they witnessed. ""But the further back in time we go, the less reliable evidence we have, since very old trees and well-preserved wood materials are extremely rare,"" said Professor Ulf Büntgen, the senior author of the study.However, analysis by the Cambridge Tree-Ring Unit (TRU) showed that the yew trees dug up from Fenland fields were very old indeed: some of these ancient trees were 400 years old when they died. The new find provides unique climate information for over a millennium from around 5,200 years ago until about 4,200 years ago, when much of the Fens was a woodland of yew and oak: completely different than it looks today.""Finding these veryold treesin the Fens is completely unexpected—it would be like turning a corner in rural Cambridgeshire and seeing an Egyptian pyramid—you just wouldn't expect it,"" said Bebchuk. ""It's the same with nature—wood rots and decomposes easily, so you just don't expect a tree that died 5,000 or 4,000 years ago to last so long.""Cross-section of a subfossil yew trunk after surface preparation. The disk contains 380 tree-rings, which means the tree was at least 380 years old when it died. Credit: Tatiana BebchukGiven that most of the Fens are barely above sea level, about 4,200 years ago, a sudden rise in sea level most likely killed the Fen woodlands. The period that the Fen woodlands died coincided with major climatic changes elsewhere in the world: at roughly the same time, a megadrought in China and the Middle East was a possible trigger of the collapse of several civilizations, including Egypt's Old Kingdom and the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia.""We want to know if there is any link between these climatic events,"" said Bebchuk. ""Are the megadroughts in Asia and the Middle East possibly related to the rapid sea level rise in northern Europe? Was this a global climate event, or was it a series of unrelated regional changes? We don't yet know what could have caused these climate events, but these trees could be an important part of solving this detective story.""""This is such a unique climate and environmental archive that will provide lots of opportunities for future studies, and it's right from Cambridge's own backyard,"" said Büntgen.

A local chief said they were sitting on a log in the middle of the river as they tried to cross when the floodwaters rose and took them away. The group was returning to their homes in Makueni County after meeting First Lady Rachel Ruto in Nairobi. Kenya, as well as neighbouring Somalia and Ethiopia, are grappling with their worst flooding in recent history. Witnesses told local media that several people had been left stranded after the Muooni River flooded following several hours of intense rain, but the group resolved to attempt crossing it anyway on Thursday evening. ""They were sitting on a log floating in the middle of the river after being overwhelmed by the raging waters as they tried to cross,"" the area chief Norman Musyoki told privately owned Daily Nation newspaper. ""A sudden swelling of the river swept them away as a crowd of witnesses looked on helplessly."" He said that authorities were trying to determine the exact number in the group, but witness accounts say at least seven were swept away. Rescue and recovery efforts by local authorities and the Kenya Red Cross are currently under way. Ongoing heavy rains and flooding - which are linked to the El Niño weather phenomenon - have killed at least 71 people and displaced more than 150,000 in Kenya, according to the Kenya Red Cross. El Niño is caused by the Pacific Ocean warming and is linked to flooding, cyclones, drought, and wildfires. Thirty-three out of 47 counties have been affected, but Makueni is one of the most affected. Despite the widespread devastation, Kenya's Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua on Wednesday said that the national government would not fund flood-response efforts. The floods have killed more than 130 people in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia, according to the aid agency Oxfam. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.","['kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'kenya', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'ethiopia', 'ethiopia']",gb,False,False

On a hot November morning, a squad of trucks arrived from the plantations to drop off a few dozen bags of beans at the Scappen cooperative in the village of Hermankono, near the central southern town of Divo, some 200 kilometres (125 miles) from the economic capital Abidjan. ""It's rained too much this year. Usually at this time, trucks are queueing up to unload. Here, we have barely 200 bags whereas we could stock 10 times as many,"" complained Sylla, chairman of the cooperative grouping some 1,500 planters. He expects harvest volume to drop some three to four times on last year's. A look in the fields nearby suggests that fear is well-founded. And Analysts confirm as much. ""Traders are worried about another short production year and these feelings have been enhanced by El Nino that could threaten West Africa crops with hot and dry weather later this year,"" said Jack Scoville of Price Futures Group. The analyst warned of ""tight supplies"" amid ""more reports of reduced arrivals in Ivory Coast and Ghana,"" the number two global producer. By a dirt track which only motorbikes could thread their way along, Bamoussa Coulibaly collected a few rare yellow-red pods from the many cocoa trees. July was a particularly rainy month in Ivory Coast's south, just as the cocoa plants were flowering. As a result, ""the flowers fell,"" the farm worker said as he explained his meagre harvest. Of those cocoa pods which resisted, some rotted anyway in the excessive humidity. Some areas have seen rainfall this year between 20 and even 40 percent above the 1991-2020 norm, according to data from national meteorological service Sodexam. To blossom fully, cocoa needs a subtle alternation between sunshine and rain. A few kilometres from Hermankono, in the bush near N'Douci, Monique Koffi Amenan waded through a marshy field resulting from weeks of rainfall which caused the neighbouring river to burst its banks. ""This year, what we've harvested won't even fill one bag, instead of the usual two. The rain has rotted the cocoa,"" explained the planter in her 40s who has spent a decade working the area with her husband. ""We'd forecast a 20 percent drop on last year and our forecasts are confirmed. With the heavy rains, many pods have rotted,"" Yves Brahima Kone, who heads Ivorian regulator the Coffee-Cocoa Council (CCC), told AFP. With a 40 percent share of global supply, Ivory Coast is the world's top producer ahead of neighbouring Ghana, whose production has recently suffered from cocoa swollen shoot virus disease, as well as illegal mining on some cocoa farms. Anticipating a poor crop, Ivory Coast suspended export contracts -- some two-thirds of produce usually goes to the EU bloc -- back in July. As a result of that move, cocoa prices have soared on commodity markets beyond $4,000 a tonne in New York, a level not seen in more than four decades, since 1978. It was a similar story in London, with a tonne fetching GBP3,478 on November 10, a post-1989 record and up 70 percent on January. The situation threatens to remain critical with the resurgence of the El Nino climate phenomenon threatening western Africa. ""This is proof that climate change is hitting developing countries hardest,"" said Ivorian economist Seraphin Prao. Even ahead of expected further El Nino woe next year, producers are already fretting over their short-term financial health. In Ivory Coast, the government sets cocoa prices. At 1,000 CFA francs per kilogram (1.50 euros, $1.70) it is higher this year than in recent seasons, but low volumes will eat into many producer families' revenues. Cocoa provides a wage for around one in five Ivorians -- some six million people -- according to the World Bank. ""My children are school age -- but if cocoa doesn't deliver, how shall we manage?"" Amenan worried. ""In a liberalised system, farmers would be winners in the current context, as cocoa (prices) reach record levels. In Cameroon, for example, where the price is not set by the state, a kilo of cocoa sells for twice as much,"" said economist Prao. Back at the Hermankono cooperative, Siaka Sylla is pinning his hopes on a better intermediate harvest next April. ""But that won't make up for our losses,"" he said.","['ctedivoire', 'ctedivoire', 'ctedivoire', 'ctedivoire', 'ctedivoire', 'ctedivoire', 'ctedivoire', 'ctedivoire', 'guinea', 'france', 'ghana', 'ghana', 'unitedstates', 'unitedkingdom', 'mexico']",us,True,False

In Coimbatore district, Mettuapalayam witnessed the season's most intense rainfall, measuring a staggering 37 cm within 24 hours. The deluge prompted the Nilgiris district collector to declare a shutdown of all government and private schools in Coonoor and Kotagiri today, citing the unrelenting precipitation. Torrential rains wreaked havoc on various parts of Coimbatore, causing extensive waterlogging and resulting in extensive traffic snarls in the textile hub. Notably, near the Ramanathapuram signal, roads were submerged under pools of rainwater, severely impacting commuting. Quick intervention by Ramanathapuram Traffic Division Special Assistant Inspectors Anbazagan and Murugaswamy proved instrumental in clearing the waterlogged roads after dedicated efforts. In Thoothukodi, heavy rains led to a tree falling on a truck, disrupting traffic for nearly two hours. The Kalgukumalai fire department and local police collaborated to swiftly remove the tree, alleviating the traffic standstill on the Mettupalayam and Coonoor route. Landslides in the area compelled authorities to redirect public traffic to the Mettupalayam-Kotagiri route. The inclement weather also prompted the Indian Railways to suspend services along the Nilgiri Mountain Rail Route between Coonoor and Mettupalayam due to landslides triggered by heavy rainfall. Mudslides obstructed tracks at Hillguro, necessitating the suspension for safety reasons. The forecast indicates a continued spell of light to moderate rains across Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal. The Indian Meteorological Department warns of thunderstorms and lightning in certain Tamil Nadu regions, while isolated heavy rainfall is expected in specific districts, including Tiruvallur, Ranipet, and Kancheepuram. The regional weather forecast department of Tamil Nadu alerts to anticipated rains in districts like Thrivallur, Chennai, Chengalpattu, Kanchipuram, Viluppuram, Cuddalore, Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, Tirunelveli, and Thotukudi. Moreover, IMD forecasts heavy rainfall in select districts for the upcoming days, emphasizing preparedness in Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram, Villupuram, Cuddalore, Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur , Thanjavur , and Pudukkottai districts of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal area on Saturday. The relentless downpours have led to widespread disruptions, forcing closures of schools in multiple districts, including Coonoor and Kotagiri. The situation remains precarious with traffic congestions, waterlogging, and incidents of vehicles getting stranded, compelling collaborative efforts by authorities and local departments to manage the chaos caused by the heavy rains in the region.

The partial cave-in of the under-construction Silkyara road tunnel in northern Uttarakhand state nearly two weeks ago -- with the desperate men still awaiting rescue on Friday -- was only the latest disaster in the geologically unstable region. Added to that are the challenges caused by rising global temperatures unleashing a cascade of extreme weather that scientists warn will get worse. ""The scale and extent of the infrastructure development needs a complete rethink,"" Shripad Dharmadhikary, an environmental researcher and veteran activist, told AFP. India's monsoon rains mean flooding is common, but major infrastructure projects in the mountains -- including hydroelectric dams, railways and roads -- are being built in areas hit ever harder by storm surges and landslides. ""It is one thing to build roads for local connectivity,"" Dharmadhikary said. ""But roads for big hydropower projects are much wider, increasing vulnerability and risk... Scale makes a big difference."" Raghav Chandra, ex-chairman of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), warned Friday that ""building a tunnel through a mountain is perilous"", but dangers were multiplied when such large-scale projects are poorly carried out. ""The accident is a wake-up call about the perils of undertaking massive construction projects in the fragile Himalayan range, which is under threat from intense human activity and the vagaries of the climate crisis,"" Chandra wrote in the Hindustan Times, alongside another top ex-NHAI official, BS Singla. The Himalayas -- the world's highest mountain range, with peaks driven upwards by colliding continental plates -- is one of the globe's most seismically active regions, with earthquakes common. Scientists say glaciers in the Himalayas are melting faster than ever due to climate change, exposing communities to unpredictable and costly disasters. Last month, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Himalayan regions were struggling with rapidly melting glaciers, warning on a visit to neighbouring Nepal that the ""rooftops of the world are caving in"". The Silkyara tunnel is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's infrastructure project aimed at cutting travel times between some of the most popular Hindu temples in the country. The 4.5-kilometre (2.7-mile) passage is meant to connect Uttarkashi and Yamunotri, two of the holiest sites. For Modi, leader of the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the grand projects help burnish his appeal, with elections due next year. But India's projects are also focused on improving access to strategic areas bordering rival China. New Delhi has been wary of Beijing's growing military assertiveness and their 3,500-kilometre shared frontier has been a perennial source of tension. ""Tunnelling helps to reduce travel time and plays a strategic role by enabling quicker passage of defence armaments and military troops,"" Chandra and Singla added. ""But, with the growing urgency to speed up construction, the manifold risks and challenges involved... are often ignored."" After the Silkyara collapse, the NHAI said it would assess all 29 under-construction tunnels to ""ensure safety and adherence to the highest quality standards"". Arnold Dix, president of the International Tunnelling and Underground Space Association, pointed out the advantages of building tunnels. ""The environmental footprint of a tunnel is likely to be less than the environmental footprint of a much larger and more complex road,"" Dix told AFP at the Silkyara tunnel site, where he is helping rescue efforts. Campaigners say that while development is needed, the breakneck pace is causing problems, including a surge of unregulated building development replacing the forests that helped keep hillsides stable. ""This decade... the Himalayas have been tunnelled, blasted, cut, gouged, turned to rubble and concretised as never before,"" environmental campaigner Priyadarshini Patel wrote in the Times of India this week. ""The development model in this young, fragile mountain range has been disastrous and needs course correction,"" added Patel, head of Ganga Ahvaan, a community group working to protect the Himalayas and the watershed of the Ganges river. ""Mega-projects are not what the Himalayas are about, culturally or geologically"".","['india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'italy', 'nepal', 'nepal', 'china', 'china']",us,False,False

Because of the pressure of the flood, water was not entering my house from the front or the back door but from under the tiles. It ended up damaging my property. The kind of doors we use are quite expensive and I have had my doors changed over and over again.”Another resident, Yusuf Lawan, said he did not leave, but moved his family away to the hotel while he stayed back.“But despite that, I lost two of my water pumps and two deep freezers,” he lamented.Our correspondent learnt that some residents refused to return but rather put their properties up for sale.Landlords in the community have also called on the state government to explore the prospects of Internally Generated Revenue in the community.The Chairman of Riverview Estate in Isheri, Abayomi Akinde, urged the government to fulfil its promise to find a lasting solution to the problem.He said, “The Ogun State Government has a lot to gain if they can fix the problem in this area and not just fix the roads.

Extreme heat, air pollution and the increasing spread of deadly infectious diseases are just some of the reasons why the World Health Organization has called climate change the single biggest health threat facing humanity. Global warming must be limited to the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees Celsius ""to avert catastrophic health impacts and prevent millions of climate change-related deaths"", according to the WHO. However, under current national carbon-cutting plans, the world is on track to warm up to 2.9C this century, the UN said this week. While no one will be completely safe from the effects of climate change, experts expect that most at risk will be children, women, the elderly, migrants and people in less developed countries which have emitted the least planet-warming greenhouse gases. On December 3, the COP28 negotiations in Dubai will host the first ""health day"" ever held at the climate negotiations. This year is widely expected to be the hottest on record. And as the world continues to warm, even more frequent and intense heatwaves are expected to follow. Heat is believed to have caused more than 70,000 deaths in Europe during summer last year, researchers said this week, revising the previous number up from 62,000. Worldwide, people were exposed to an average of 86 days of life-threatening temperatures last year, according to the Lancet Countdown report earlier this week. The number of people over 65 who died from heat rose by 85 percent from 1991-2000 to 2013-2022, it added. And by 2050, more than five times more people will die from the heat each year under a 2C warming scenario, the Lancet Countdown projected. More droughts will also drive rising hunger. Under the scenario of 2C warming by the end of the century, 520 million more people will experience moderate or severe food insecurity by 2050. Meanwhile, other extreme weather events such as storms, floods and fires will continue to threaten the health of people across the world. Almost 99 percent of the world's population breathes air that exceeds the WHO's guidelines for air pollution. Outdoor air pollution driven by fossil fuel emissions kills more than four million people every year, according to the WHO. It increases the risk of respiratory diseases, strokes, heart disease, lung cancer, diabetes and other health problems, posing a threat that has been compared to tobacco. The damage is caused partly by PM2.5 microparticles, which are mostly from fossil fuels. People breathe these tiny particles into their lungs, where they can then enter the bloodstream. While spikes in air pollution, such as extremes seen in India's capital New Delhi earlier this month, trigger respiratory problems and allergies, long-term exposure is believed to be even more harmful. However it is not all bad news. The Lancet Countdown report found that deaths from air pollution due to fossil fuels have fallen 16 percent since 2005, mostly due to efforts to reduce the impact of coal burning. The changing climate means that mosquitoes, birds and mammals will roam beyond their previous habitats, raising the threat that they could spread infectious diseases with them. Mosquito-borne diseases that pose a greater risk of spreading due to climate change include dengue, chikungunya, Zika, West Nile virus and malaria. The transmission potential for dengue alone will increase by 36 percent with 2C warming, the Lancet Countdown report warned. Storms and floods create stagnant water that are breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and also increase the risk of water-borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid and diarrhoea. Scientists also fear that mammals straying into new areas could share diseases with each other, potentially creating new viruses that could then jump over to humans. Worrying about the present and future of our warming planet has also provoked rising anxiety, depression and even post-traumatic stress -- particularly for people already struggling with these disorders, psychologists have warned. In the first 10 months of the year, people searched online for the term ""climate anxiety"" 27 times more than during the same period in 2017, according to data from Google Trends cited by the BBC this week.","['unitedarabemirates', 'india', 'india']",us,False,False

But the audition for the next World Cup, though in a different format, has already begun. In seven months’ time, the T20 World Cup will be held in the US and the West Indies. And the two finalists of the title clash in Ahmedabad — India and Australia — with just a handful of players who played in that final, have been the first to hit the ground running for the next big ICC event with a five-match T20 series.Team India’s aspirants for the T20 World Cup showed that they wouldn’t be intimidated by the opposition nor by the enormity of the challenge when they pulled off Men in Blue’s highest ever successful run-chase in a last-ball thriller against Australia in the first T20 in Visakhapatnam on Thursday.And they will carry that confidence into the second game here at the Greenfield Stadium on Sunday when they take on the Matthew Wade-led Australia.Suryakumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan were the chief protagonists of the win in Vizag as they launched a blistering counterattack after the early dismissal of the openers. While Yadav showed he is a different beast in T20 with a 42-ball 80, Kishan demonstrated his destructive power with a blazing 39-ball 58.The team management, however, would have been happier with the composure shown by Rinku Singh, who hit a crucial unbeaten 22 to help India get over the line. However, the ineffectiveness of the bowlers in the middle overs would be a point to ponder for the coaching staff led by VVS Laxman. They would be hoping for a course correction in the second game. Only Mukesh Kumar’s death-over bowling stood out in the first T20, though he went wicketless in the game. Left-arm Pacer Arshdeep Singh would have pleasant memories of the pitch at Greenfield as he had exploited the swinging conditions to claim three wickets and restrict the South Africans to just 106 when a T20I was last played here more than a year ago.Though the pitch for Sunday’s game may not be as conducive for the bowlers as the one that was laid out for the last T20 that was played here, the bowlers would be praying that it helps them more than the one in Vizag.For Australia, Josh Inglis came up with a blistering ton and Steve Smith enhanced his T20 prospects with a half-century in the first game. But the inexperience of their bowling attack was exposed on Thursday and it may prompt a change in personnel.The World Cup stars — Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head and Adam Zampa — didn’t play the first game in Vizag but they are very much available for the second game if the Aussie team management desires to field them. The biggest concern before any game in this part of the world is the weather. Torrential rain on Wednesday resulted in a deluge in some parts of Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday, though the Greenfield Stadium remained largely unaffected. It was pretty hot and humid when the Australians arrived for an optional practice session on Saturday afternoon.","['india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'australia', 'us', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedstates']",in,True,True

At least four storm-related deaths have been reported by local media. Ukraine says 2,019 of its villages and towns have no power after snowstorms. The storm is also battering Moldova, Georgia and Bulgaria. In Russia's Black Sea port of Sochi, big waves have been seen battering the city's seafront. Footage has also emerged purportedly showing a three-storey building collapsing. Near the town of Anapa, also on the Russian Black Sea coast, a cargo vessel with 21 crew has run aground. In the capital Moscow, authorities had to deploy specialist machinery to clear the streets after heavy snowfall. In Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula - illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 - Moscow-installed officials reported flooding in coastal areas. Fallen trees and other debris were seen on the streets of several towns. About 800 exotic fish died when a historic museum-aquarium was destroyed by sea flooding in the port of Sevastopol, the museum director was quoted as saying by a local media outlet. A state of emergency is now in place in several municipalities in Crimea. Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior ministry, said the storm ""washed away trenches in occupied Crimea that the Russian army dug out on the beaches"". Russia's military has not commented on the claim. Meanwhile, Ukraine's DSNS emergency service said snowstorms and fierce winds were battering 16 regions of the country. It said 48 people, including children, had been evacuated from trapped vehicles in the worst-affected Odesa region in the south-west. As many as 840 vehicles had to be towed away as snow drifts reached more than two metres (6.6ft) in some places, the emergency service said. At least 1,370 cargo lorries are currently stuck. At least six people have suffered hypothermia. Traffic is currently blocked on 14 motorways. Ukraine's southern Mykolaiv region is also badly hit. More than 1,500 rescuers are now deployed across Ukraine in a massive clean-up operation. They are being helped by police, border guards and National Guard members. In the capital Kyiv, the country's largest flag - measuring 16x24m - had to be taken down from a 90m pole after it was damaged by fierce winds. City officials said the flag would be replaced and raised again. The extreme weather comes as reports say Russia is again preparing massive rocket and drone strikes on Ukraine's power grid and other critical infrastructure. Last autumn and winter, Moscow carried out waves of such deadly attacks, leaving millions of people across Ukraine without electricity and heating. Last Saturday, Russia launched its biggest drone strike on Kyiv since its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukrainian officials said. They said that 74 out of 75 of Shahed kamikaze drones were shot down around the capital. Are you in the area? If it is safe to do so, share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

More than 2,000 towns and villages were without electricity on Sunday night and Monday morning in 16 Ukrainian regions, including Odesa, Mykolaiv and inland in Kyiv, as trees were uprooted, power lines snapped and electrical substations failed, leaving almost 150,000 households in the area without electricity, Ukraine’s Energy Ministry said. A 110-metre (360ft) chimney of a heat and power plant collapsed in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Sunday night, adding to Ukraine’s losses of energy infrastructure that have already sustained heavy damage from Moscow’s militarycampaign targeting Ukraine’s power grid. As winter nears, Russia has been attackingcivilian infrastructurefar from the front lines, leaving millions of Ukrainians without power, heat and water for days at a time.

The head of Russia’s national meteorological service said the storm that hit Crimea was the most powerful since record-keeping began, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. At least three people were killed during the storm, local media reported. One person was killed in the resort city of Sochi, another on the Russian-held Crimean Peninsula and a third person on board a vessel in the Kerch Strait, which separates Crimea from the Russian mainland, the state news agency TASS reported. Russia’s Ministry of Energy said “about 1.9 million people” were affected by power cuts in the southern Russian regions of Dagestan, Krasnodar and Rostov as well as the occupied Ukrainian territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhia and Crimea.

The warm surface water initially driven by the trade winds towards the coasts of Indonesia and eastern Australia then sloshes back eastwards, which can have devastating consequences.Physicist Armin Bunde from Justus Liebig University Giessen (JLU), together with Josef Ludescher and John Schellnhuber from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), has succeeded for the first time in developing a method that can be used to predict, with high accuracy and about one year in advance, how dangerous a coming El Niño will be.Their resultshave been published in the journalnpj Climate and Atmospheric Science.There are two different forms of this weather phenomenon: Often the warm surface water that sloshes back only reaches the center of the Pacific, in which case it is referred to as a Central Pacific El Niño. In some cases, however, thewarm waterreaches the eastern Pacific, which then warms significantly—this is the Eastern Pacific El Niño.Both types can impact theclimate, but the Eastern Pacific El Niño is much more dangerous, as it can causesevere droughtsas well as heavy rainfall and flooding in many parts of the world. In addition, the high water temperatures off the coast of Peru and Chile ensure that the majority of fish retreat to cooler regions, leaving the fishing nets empty.The method used by the physicists from Giessen and Potsdam to predict the type of an El Niño is based on the analysis of the water temperatures in the Western and Central Pacific since 1950.Previously, scientists could only predict the onset of an El Niño about one year in advance, with the help of a climate network they had introduced earlier. However, the new method also makes it possible to forecast its type and thus its hazard potential.""We can now correctly predict the type of an upcoming El Niño with a probability of 86%,"" says Josef Ludescher, first author of the study and former Ph.D. student of Armin Bunde.""This means that if we obtain a forecast from our climate network at the end of the year that an El Niño is on its way and our new method indicates a Central Pacific El Niño, then we can already give some all-clear for the coming fall and winter. However, extreme caution is advised if the method points to an East Pacific El Niño. The long lead time coupled with the high accuracy is important to be able to initiate suitable adaptation measures in the affected areas at an early stage and thus prevent or at least mitigate possible disasters and protect human lives.""Armin Bunde also emphasizes the high quality of the new El Niño forecasting option. ""Our early warning system is clearly superior to even the latest generation of Earth system models in terms of advance warning time and accuracy. Using our method, we had already predicted this year's East Pacific El Niño in December 2022.""","['indonesia', 'australia', 'not found', 'peru', 'chile', 'germany', 'germany']",gb,False,False

World leaders will meet later this week in Dubai to discuss global efforts to reduce emissions of planet-warming pollution and transition to renewable energy sources.Frank Augstein/APhide caption Wind turbines generate electricity off the coast of England. World leaders will meet later this week in Dubai to discuss global efforts to reduce emissions of planet-warming pollution and transition to renewable energy sources. A major, annual international climate meeting kicks off later this week in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. World leaders are meeting from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12 to discuss the effects of climate change, efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the increasingly pressing question of who will pay for the costs of a hotter planet. Attendance at the annual negotiationshas balloonedand hit anestimated 45,000 peoplelast year. Thousands of climate scientists, mayors, activists, corporate executives and representatives of major oil companies will also fly to thepetroleum-dependent host countryto attend hundreds of side events. The meeting comes at the close of the hottest year ever recorded on Earth. Extreme weather is killing people around the world. And while it'sstill possiblefor humans to avoid catastrophic climate change effects — such as mass extinctions and runaway sea level rise by the end of this century — it is only possible if greenhouse gas pollution falls dramatically and immediately, scientists warn. Meanwhile, a fight is brewing over whether the countries most responsible for causing climate change willfollow through on promisesto help the most vulnerable countriesfoot the billfor adapting to a hotter world. Here's what you need to know about what's at stake and what to expect. This meeting happens every year and is arranged by the branch of the United Nations that handles global negotiations about climate change. In U.N.-speak, the climate meeting is called the Conference of the Parties, or COP. This is the 28th Conference of the Parties, so it's called COP28. At the end of the 2015 COP meeting, world leaders signed the landmark Paris climate agreement. The Paris Agreement requires virtually every country on Earth to pledge how much they'll cut planet-warming pollution and update those plans every few years. The goal is to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to temperatures in the late 1800s, and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. This year, world leaders are required to review humanity's collective progress toward that goal. And the situation is not good. A U.N.analysis released this monthfound that global greenhouse gas emissions are still rising, and the planet is on track for at least 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century. And while it's still possible to stay below 2 degrees of warming — and every tenth of a degree of warming the world avoids will save lives — scientists warn that the1.5 degree target is slipping away. Last year's COP27 meeting in Egypt ended with a watered-down agreement that left out language calling for a phaseout of all fossil fuels — the biggest driver of global warming. The summits have become a circus, ""with the petrostates as the ringmasters"" and everyone else as ""the clowns,"" Sandrine Dixson-Declèvewrote last year, as co-president of The Club of Rome, a nonprofit in Switzerland that works on climate change. The problem, Dixson-Declève told NPR, is combining international negotiations with a trade show. The number of lobbyists who attend the events has soared, she says, and civil society groups struggle to afford the cost of reserving pavilion space in the COP conference hall. ""Some are actually given easier access than others because they can pay for it. And that means that those that have pavilions might be able to invite certain governments to come and have a conversation,"" Dixson-Declève says. ""It may not seem like direct lobbying, but it is potentially indirect lobbying, depending on where the conversation goes. So I think it's incredibly important that we take into consideration this aspect, which has created a very unfair playing field."" Yet the COP meetings remain crucial events for activists and poor countries hit hardest by climate-fueled disasters. ""One of the big values of the U.N. process, actually, is that everybody's at the table,"" says David Waskow, director of the International Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute. The meetings are not ""a panacea,"" Waskow adds, but they ""give us a sense of the direction we need to travel in and also can be a catalyst."" Rishikesh Ram Bhandary, assistant director of the Global Economic Governance Initiative at Boston University, says he understands the public's frustration with the climate talks. Part of it seems to stem from a mismatch between the U.N.'s multilateral process, which ensures every country has a say but often delivers incremental progress, and the urgency people feel as the impacts of climate change get worse. That tension has only grown as the United Arab Emirates, a big oil producer, prepares to host this year's meeting. Given its knowledge of oil and gas, the UAE has a chance to chart a practical but ambitious path to move the world off of fossil fuels, Dixson-Declève says. ""That would be the perfect scenario,"" she says. But the world seems to be moving in the opposite direction. António Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general,said earlier in Novemberthat governments ""are literally doubling down on fossil fuel production."" Loading... One of the biggest debates will be over compensation that wealthier countries could pay to nations hardest hit by climate change. It's known as ""loss and damage."" Lower-income countries bear the brunt of climate impacts, such as floods, fires and drought that cause billions of dollars in destruction. But they have contributed little to the planetary warming driving those disasters. Countries like the U.S. and those in Europe built their wealth through fossil fuel use and are responsible for most of the heat-trapping emissions in the atmosphere today. For years, developing nations have argued that they're owed for the damage caused by climate change. Loss and damage funding could be used to prepare for future impacts, like building infrastructure orrelocating communities, as well as compensating them forirreplaceable cultural resourcesthat have been lost. At the 2022 climate summit, countriesmade a historic agreementto create a fund especially for that purpose. Since then, negotiations have been bumpy. Countries have argued about which nations should pay into the fund, which should be eligible to receive funding and where the fund is housed. Right now,the plan isfor the World Bank to house the ""loss and damage"" fund temporarily. But global leaders would need to sign off on that plan at the COP28 talks. And some developing countries are concerned about the plan, because it only urges, not requires, richer countries to contribute funding. Rescuers search for people after a landslide in India in August that was caused by torrential rains. Climate-driven disasters are particularly destructive in places that are not wealthy, and such disasters can set off cycles of destruction, debt and further vulnerability.Pradeep Kumar/APhide caption Rescuers search for people after a landslide in India in August that was caused by torrential rains. Climate-driven disasters are particularly destructive in places that are not wealthy, and such disasters can set off cycles of destruction, debt and further vulnerability. Industrialized countries have pledged $100 billion annually to developing countries to help them adapt to global warming and move away from fossil fuels, but studies suggest much more money is needed. ""The needs for climate finance are much, much higher — more on the order of a trillion dollars per year,"" says Laura Kuhl, assistant professor of public policy and international affairs at Northeastern University. A recent assessment from theOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Developmentsays developing countries will need at least $2.4 trillion each year by 2026. This money — called ""climate finance"" — can help developing countries switch from planet-heating fossil fuels to clean energy. It also includes money for adapting to climate change. Stacy-ann Robinson, an associate professor of environmental studies at Colby College, says you can't talk about climate finance without talking about climate justice. ""Countries in the Global South,"" Robinson says, ""are saying, 'Listen, we contributed the least to historical greenhouse gas emissions, but based on a number of factors — environmental and otherwise — we will be impacted the most.'"" That's why back in 2009 at the climate conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, industrialized nations announced thattheywould take the lead on climate finance. They pledged that by 2020, they would give $100 billion each year toward funding climate adaptation and reducing fossil fuel use in the Global South. They missed the 2020 goal. And although industrialized nationsmay have finally reached the $100 billionmark in 2022, in Dubai the discussions will center on how to get closer to the trillion dollar range. This will involve engaging countries, institutions like the World Bank and the IMF, and the private sector. They won't help. Climate diplomacy is already contentious. The conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are further complicating, if not worsening, diplomatic relations among some of the world's largest historic contributors to climate change — namely, the United States, Russia and China. U.N. Secretary-General Guterres acknowledged the problem in recent remarks, saying that it's clear that world leaders face ""distractions"" from addressing climate change. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has trashed its relations with the U.S. and the European Union, which have been providing Ukraine with billions of dollars in aid and weaponry. At last year's climate talks, representatives from developing countries raised questions about why rich countries like the U.S. have been quick to deliver weapons, while slow-walking funds for climate adaptation and clean energy. Those concerns are likely to come up again in Dubai, as the U.S. is now delivering billions of dollars more to Israel. Israel's continued bombardment of the Gaza Strip is also raising the ire of other countries in the Middle East and Global South, and a broader regional conflict could cause chaos in the world's energy markets. All of this makes it more difficult for world leaders to maintain consensus and focus on addressing the global issue of human-caused climate change.","['unitedkingdom', 'unitedkingdom', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'unitedstates', 'france', 'not found', 'not found', 'egypt', 'switzerland', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'india', 'india', 'denmark', 'denmark', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'ukraine', 'russia', 'russia', 'china', 'israel', 'israel', 'palestinianterritories']",us,True,False

Twenty-four people have died by lightning strikes and about 23 injured in rain-related incidents in the western Indian state of Gujarat over the past two days, government officials say, with rains continuing on Monday morning. The state was hit by heavy rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms and hailstorms on Sunday and Monday, with some places receiving up to 144mm (5.7 inches) of rain in the 24 hours ending Monday morning, according to state government data. The rains caused damage to houses and loss of cattle across the state. At least 40 animals were also killed. “We will begin a survey soon to assess the loss suffered,” Gujarat Agriculture Minister Raghavji Patel said on Monday, adding that compensation will be paid to victims on the basis of the survey’s results. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast rainfall to continue in parts of the state on Monday. Federal Home Minister Amit Shah, who along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi hails from Gujarat, said he was “deeply saddened” by the deaths, in a post on social media platform X. Gujarat is not unfamiliar with rain-related calamities, but such big rainstorms are not expected in the state during winter months, and fierce downpours caught many off guard. In August 2020, 14 people died in the state over just two days in various incidents related to heavy rains and flooding. A year previously, in August 2019, 31 people died in the state in rain-related incidents. While flash floods and lightning kill dozens of people in India each year, scientists warn that rising global temperatures are unleashing a cascade of extreme weather events.

The last time such a storm occurred was more than 160 years ago, Vilfand added. The meteorologist said that wind speed had reached 40 meters per second (144kph). At least one person died overnight and ten people have sustained injuries in the disaster, according to the regional authorities. A total of 400,000 people in Crimea were left without electricity in the wake of the storm, and several local municipal districts declared a state of emergency. Videos shared on social media show huge waves hitting Crimean shores and city embankments, including at Sevastopol. Houses and highways were flooded with sea water, while other areas of the peninsula faced snowstorms. Crimea was not the only area hit by the disaster. In Russia’s Krasnodar Region, which includes a long stretch of the eastern Black Sea coast, the storm damaged buildings and led to flooding, videos taken by locals and tourists show. Footage captured waves hitting a power line near a railway. In another clip taken from a moving train, a railway line running close to the shore collapses because of the storm. Around 50 trains were delayed due to damage sustained by the line, RIA Novosti reported. Other videos show a one-story building collapsing due to gusty winds in the southern Russian city of Sochi. At least one person died in the city because of the storm, which has largely moved on from the area, Russian media reported.","['russia', 'russia', 'russia']",ru,True,True

Later, he creates a report that includes data from sensors and another camera installed near the Shisper glacier to update his village an hour’s hike downstream. The 51-year-old’s mission: mobilise his community of 200 families in Hassanabad, in the Karakoram mountains, to fight for a future for their village and way of life, increasingly under threat from unstable lakes formed by melting glacier ice. When glacial lakes overfill or their banks become unsound, they burst, sparking deadly floods that wash out bridges and buildings and wipe out fertile land throughout the Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Himalayan mountain ranges that intersect in northern Pakistan. Himalayan glaciers are on track to lose up to 75 percent of their ice by the century’s end due to global warming, according to the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). After all the sensors are installed, village representatives will be able to monitor data through their mobile phones. “Local wisdom is very important,” Jamil said. “We are the main observers. We have witnessed many things.” Hassanabad is part of the United Nations-backed Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) II project to help communities downstream of melting glaciers adapt. Amid a shortfall in funding for those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, village residents say they urgently need increased support to adapt to threats of glacial lake floods. “The needs are enormous,” said Karma Lodey Rapten, regional technical specialist for climate change adaptation at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Pakistan is the only country to receive adaptation funding from the Green Climate Fund – the Paris Agreement’s key financing pot – to ease the risk of such floods. While countries like Bhutan have worked with other funders to minimise the threat from glacial lake floods, the $36.96m GLOF II scheme – which ends this year – is a global benchmark for other regions grappling with this threat, including the Peruvian Andes and China. Since 2017, weather stations as well as sensors measuring rainfall, water discharge, and river and lake water levels have been installed under the administration of Islamabad and UNDP. GLOF II has deployed speakers in villages to communicate warnings, and infrastructure like stone-and-wire barriers that slow floodwater. In Hassanabad, a villager regularly monitors the feed from a camera installed high up the valley, checking water levels in the river by the glacier’s base, during risky periods such as summer, when a lake dammed by ice from the Shisper glacier often forms. Pakistan is among the world’s most at-risk countries from glacial lake floods, with 800,000 people living within 15km (9.3 miles) of a glacier. Many residents of the Karakorams built their homes on lush land along rivers running off glaciers.

Read our impressions . $130 at Amazon $130 at HyperX Walmart is selling the Xbox Series S 512GB console in white with an extra matching controller for $289.99 (about $80 off). That’s less than the regular cost of the $299.99 console alone, and you get a spare controller for local multiplayer or backup duties. One of the best deals on new games is at QVC, where you can get $15 off your first order of $40 or more when you use promo code HOLIDAY .

And $69.99 games like Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 drop to $54.99. However, these newer titles sometimes go out of stock, and it’s a one-time use code, so choose carefully.

It’s as good as the j7 Plus, with the bonus of a retractable mop on top that can polish your hard floors as it vacuums. It’s great at avoiding obstacles, features good battery life, and includes an auto-emptying docking station. $699 at Wellbots $699 at Amazon $699 at Best Buy Roborock S8 $ 600 $ 750 20 % off $ 600 $ 600 $ 750 20 % off For a great robot vacuum that can mop and doesn’t require a huge auto-empty dock, get the Roborock S8. With dual rubber roller brushes, 6,000 Pa suction, and a flat mop that vibrates 3,000 times a second to simulate some good old-fashioned scrubbing , the S8 is a mean cleaning machine. It can sense carpets, lift up its mop, and has Roborock’s best AI-powered obstacle avoidance. There’s still no camera, though. It works as a standalone vacuum or pairs with an auto-empty dock, but you must manually fill its (sizable) water tank. $600 at Best Buy $600 at Roborock The Roborock S7 , the S8’s predecessor, is also on sale at Walmart for $285. This was our former pick for the best robot vacuum / mop combo before the S8 took its place. The impressive robovac lacks some newer bells and whistles, including AI-obstacle avoidance, but it keeps carpets dry thanks to the mop’s unique lifting mechanism. The brand-new iRobot Roomba j9 is seeing its first-ever discount, down to $599 from $899 at Amazon . This bot features an auto-empty dock, higher suction power than the j7, and a new Dirt Detective feature that learns which rooms are dirtiest in your home and cleans them first. The Roomba Combo j9 Plus mopping version is also on sale for $999, down from $1,399 . This is the first Roomba that can refill its own mop as well as empty its bin, and the new self-empty / fill dock has a stylish design that can also act as a side table. Yeedi Vac 2 Pro $ 179 $ 400 55 % off $ 179 $ 179 $ 400 55 % off For $180 at Amazon with on-page coupon, the Yeedi is almost 50 percent off its original price. A brilliant bargain for a robot vac that can avoid most obstacles (not cables or pet waste), pick up pet hair with 3,000 Pa of suction, and mop your floors with an aggressive oscillating action. Read my review . $179 at Amazon (with on-page coupon) Shark Ion $ 139 $ 260 47 % off $ 139 $ 139 $ 260 47 % off A true budget bot with no bells and whistles, just a determination to get the job done. With a two-hour runtime, decent-size bin, and tank-like wheels that can get over most large obstacles, the Shark is a good workhorse for a low price. It’s loud and will get tangled on cables, but the app is easy to use, and it works with Amazon Alexa and Google Home for voice and smart home control. $139 at Walmart Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Self-Empty Robot Vacuum and Mop $ 400 $ 700 43 % off $ 400 $ 400 $ 700 43 % off The Shark (also known as the Shark AI Ultra 2-in-1) is a cheaper robot that self-empties its bin, vacuums, and mops. It mops very well — doing a swingy, scrubbing movement with its rear end when in “Matrix mode.” You have to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir and empty the bin when it mops — as it only self-empties in vacuum mode, and it can only avoid larger objects. $400 at Shark Amazon is discounting the Shark AI Ultra 2-in-1 (also known as the Shark Matrix) to $249.98 ($200 off), which is the lowest price we’ve seen on the budget-friendly robot vacuum / mop hybrid. This is just the robot without the auto-empty base. It’s a little loud but has good suction, a great app, and a laundry list of features (including mapping). Roborock Q Revo $ 680 $ 900 24 % off $ 680 $ 680 $ 900 24 % off This is the first sub-$1,000 bot that can do everything, just not quite as well as the top-of-the-line options. It vacuums, mops, self-empties, fills its mop reservoir, and cleans and dries its oscillating mops. It can map, has virtual keep-out zones, and works with voice assistants. But there’s no AI-powered obstacle avoidance, and its single roller brush isn’t as effective as the double ones on the j7 and S8. $680 at Amazon $680 at Walmart $680 at Roborock The Roborock Q5 Pro is $319.97 , down from $429.99 at Amazon . An excellent midrange vacuum, it packs 5,200 Pa suction power and two rubber roller brushes that are great at picking up pet hair. It’s not fancy, but with a huge 770ml bin with big wheels to get up on higher-pile carpets, it’s a good option for families with pets. The Plus version is also on sale for $479.97 and adds a self-empty dock that automatically empties the robot’s bin when it’s full.

The India Rivers Forum, a network of organisations and individuals who work towards conservation and safeguarding the country’s rivers and organised the India Rivers Week, is calling for a suspension of the River Front Development (RFD) project and a proper review with the participation of everybody. In a statement released on Monday, the India Rivers Forum, the organisers of the event, said, “RFDs have been promoted in a big way by the central and state governments across the country in the name of rejuvenating and beautifying the rivers. Some of the prominent sites for RFD projects across India are Varanasi,Bhagalpur, Jaipur,Ahmedabad, Vadodara,Hyderabad,Jammu, Kota,Bilaspur, Patna,GuwahatiandPune. Though RFD aims to revitalise the riverfront areas, in reality these projects are less about river restoration and more about the encroachment of floodplains and riverbeds characterised by heavily concretised embankments and other structures like barrages and also reclaiming floodplains and riverbeds for real estate development. The Pune RFD project follows the same trajectory”. Speaking toThe Indian Express, KJ Joy of India Rivers Forum said, “When we went to visit a few sites in the Mula-Mutha system, where the River Front Development has been taken up, we saw truckloads of cement, rubble and other material on the side of the river bank. If we use this much concrete, it will be against the spirit of climate mitigation.” Members of the India Rivers Forum have raised a number of “serious concerns”. Among these, they have pointed out in the statement that topographically the Pune Metropolitan region is prone to heavy flood risk. “With more than 20 per cent of the floodplains already encroached, breaching both the 25-year and 100-year flood lines across the city, construction of embankments and barrages on the prohibitive zone under the RFD project would further constrict the rivers, reducing their carrying capacity leading to an increase in the flood risk. There is no room for the rivers to absorb floods under this project, especially considering that the Pune region is going to experience an increase in rainfall due to climate change and existing encroachments”. “We are not saying that the river should be left as it is. The river, seriously, needs rejuvenation but the way it is being done is killing the river. The PMC’s vision appears to be to convert the river into stagnant pools of water and concretise banks and artificial vegetation. That is not the vision that we think a river should be. We have an alternative vision of a more nature-based rejuvenation programme for the rivers,” Shripad Dharmadhikary told The Indian Express.","['unitedarabemirates', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india', 'india']",in,True,True

For hundreds of years, people have shaped the world around them for their benefit: They drained lakes, deforested lands and mined for metals and minerals to grow wealth and economies. They dug up billions of tons of coal, and then oil and gas, to fuel empires and economies. The allure of exploiting nature and burning fossil fuels as a path to prosperity hopped from nation to nation, each eager to secure their own cheap energy. Over hundreds of years, that impulse has remade the planet's climate, too - and brought its inhabitants to the brink of catastrophe. Anya Zilberstein, a historian of climate science at Concordia University in Montreal, highlighted Europeans colonizing the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries as major factor of today's climate and environmental crises. ""They bring with them this idea that conquest and then the development of the cultivation of landscapes, like taking down trees, opening up lands to European-style agriculture, that the draining of swamps ... will also change the climate, usually for the better,"" Zilberstein said. Jan Golinski, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire, said Europeans of the time thought that their changes - cutting down forests, draining swamps, plowing land - would change the climate as well, to something closer to their homelands. He said they saw this engineering as positive. ""They believed that their society was making progress,"" Golinski said. That early modern period solidified notions of industry, progress, productivity and growth that make it harder to tackle the current climate crisis, Zilberstein said. Then, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the balance tipped dramatically in coal's favor as an energy source, through technological advances like steam power, new transportation routes like canals and later railroads, and a desire to better control how, when and where energy was used. Steam power made it easier for factory owners to control labour and nature than an economy based on water power, for example, because they could be set up anywhere and weren't vulnerable to floods or droughts said Andreas Malm, an associate professor of human ecology at Lund University in Sweden. The British then ""forcibly exported this model and integrated other countries such as India or Egypt or what became Nigeria into a kind of an economy that was dependent on fossil fuel"", said Malm. Other nations then began ""searching for fossil fuels in various places in the Ottoman Empire, in the Indian subcontinent and elsewhere"", said On Barak, a historian at Tel Aviv University and co-founder of the Laboratory for the History of Climate Change. Then came oil. Oil use grew in the late 19th century because it wasn't as labour-intensive as coal, whose workers now had strong unions in some Western nations, historians say. Like coal, oil was easy to store, it's more energy-rich than coal, and it's easier to move; as a liquid it can be shipped through pipes, as well as by trucks, tankers and railcars, said J.R. McNeill, a historian at Georgetown University. By the 20th century, the growth in oil helped fuel technologies like cars and air travel that became more affordable in many global north countries. Other nations such as China, Japan and India began assembling their own energy regimes based on fossil fuels. As Europe, the US and Japan built their energy systems around internal combustion engines, it made the global investment in an oil-dominated fossil fuel regime ""gigantic and harder, but not impossible, to reverse or replace"", McNeill said. Meanwhile, coal kept its place in the global economy. In China and Japan, growing consumption was a signal and barometer of developing economies, said Victor Seow, a historian of science at Harvard University. After the Communist Revolution in 1949, the Chinese government measured growth by its production of items like cloth, electricity, wheat, iron, steel - and coal, too. Japan studied Western mining to develop their own coal fields. China is now the world's current largest greenhouse gas emitter, although the United States still trumps it historically. India has also become a major coal-burning nation. Fredrik Albritton Jonsson, a historian at the University of Chicago, said humans can decide what kind of world they want to live in, and tailor their development within nature's boundaries. ""There are two kinds of boundaries to this economy,"" said Fredrik Albritton Jonsson, a historian at the University of Chicago. ""One is a sort of upper boundary of planetary limits"" of what our natural world can withstand, ""and then there's a lower boundary, that would guarantee minimum social needs, entitlements, the right to education, the right to clean water, the right to a steady income"".

Shukri Abdi Osman, a 34-year-old mother of three, is sheltering in a camp for the displaced in Dolow with her children, among around 700 families forced to flee as flash floods engulfed many parts of town. ""I have never seen such devastating floods before, everything happened quickly. When we realised the water was coming it was too late to collect all our belongings. We left our houses at midnight and all we were able to grab was our children,"" she told AFP. As the family breadwinner, Osman said she thought she had a bright future, with plans to expand her flourishing fruit and vegetable kiosk in the Garbolow neighbourhood of Dolow, which lies on the Juba River near the Ethiopia border. ""But I ended up here in this IDP settlement hopelessly waiting for the situation to change. My business is gone, my property is destroyed, and my house engulfed in water,"" she said, as she struggled to light firewood to cook a meal for her children. And now disease is posing a threat to her family. ""The toilets were destroyed and even the tap water is now mixed with the dirty flood water which includes leaking septic tanks,"" she said. ""The situation is very tough now in this camp with my daughter feeling unwell, she might have already contracted malaria and typhoid."" Somalia's government has declared a state of emergency over what the United Nations has called ""once-in-a-century"" flooding, with almost 100 lives lost across the country and 700,000 people made homeless. Torrential rains linked to the El Nino weather phenomenon have lashed the Horn of Africa on the heels of the worst drought in 40 years that drove millions to the brink of famine in Somalia. It is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, locked in a vicious cycle of drought and floods. But is particularly ill-equipped to cope with the crisis as it battles deep poverty and a deadly Islamist insurgency. In one of the worst El Nino episodes, in late 1997 and early 1998, at least 1,800 people died in Somalia alone when the Juba River burst its banks. The latest floods have washed away homes, schools, farmland, roads and bridges, leaving many without shelter, food or clean drinking water. Mohamed Dahir, water and sanitation officer with US charity Mercy Corps, told AFP that humanitarian agencies are now concerned about those vulnerable to disease. ""The possibility for malaria outbreak is high due to the mosquitos, and there are also concerns about watery diarrhoea breaking out due to the possible contamination of the water system."" ""We still don't know exactly the level of contamination but what we have seen is the leaked septic tanks and destroyed toilets of the affected neighbourhood which contaminate the water wells."" The UN humanitarian agency OCHA said in an update last week that 33 districts of Somalia had been deluged, with a significant increase in cases of Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) or cholera and a rise in malaria cases. It said there were concerns that contaminated stagnant water around schools poses a ""serious risk"" of waterborne diseases for school children. Sadia Sharif Hassan, a 40-year-old mother of seven, sits in a makeshift shelter in a Dolow IDP camp, begging her neighbour for a container so she can fetch water. ""The most important thing is to save the lives of our children,"" she told AFP, saying the family barely had enough food to eat each day. ""The mosquitos are relentless and several of my children are already feeling unwell, they are suffering from fever... all their bodies are covered with bites now."" In Garboolow, 70-year-old Owliyo Mohamed Abdirahman almost slipped and fell in the mud as she tried to rescue belongings from her damaged corrugated metal home but found everything had been swept away. ""This is what is left of my house in which I lived with my son who is sick now, his children and his wife,"" she said in despair. ""We ran away with our lives and carried nothing else."" She and her family are having to rely on the kindness of well-wishers who have provided food and clothing. Somalia has been locked in an endless cycle of drought and floods. In one of the worst El Nino episodes, in late 1997 and early 1998, at least 1,800 people died when the Juba River burst its banks. Garboolow commissioner Mursal Mohamed Adan said the authorities are waiting anxiously for help from aid agencies.

President William Ruto convened an emergency cabinet meeting on Monday and said 38 of Kenya's 47 counties had been affected by floods and mudslides made worse by the El Niño phenomenon. State House spokesperson Hussein Mohammed also noted “disease outbreaks, destruction of infrastructure and property as well as prolonged power outages” across Kenya and the region. The worst affected areas are the coastal cities of Mombasa and Malindi and the northern Kenya region which borders Somalia, also hit hard by flooding. In Kenya's Garissa town, thousands of people have been displaced after their homes were swept away. “All roads are destroyed. I don’t even know where people will go,” Garissa resident Joel Ngui told The Associated Press. Many roads and bridges have been washed away or partially destroyed, making it difficult to reach people marooned by flood waters. Residents living by the Tana River, Kenya's largest, have been left homeless and hungry after it burst its banks. Marian Ware, a widow and mother of five, escaped with her children after her home was carried away. She constructed a makeshift shelter on higher ground. “I had no one to help me, my husband died a long time ago,"" she said. ""I was struggling to get my children to safety. When I went back, everything was gone.” Ruto on Sunday activated a National Disaster Operation Center but fell short of declaring the floods a national emergency. His spokesperson, Hussein, said that could change “if things get out of hand, if things get worse.” Kenya’s meteorological department has warned that the heavy rains will continue into the new year.

The weather damaged houses and killed livestock across western Gujarat state. Storms are unusual in Gujarat during winter, meteorologists said, and the fierce downpour caught many off guard. Flash floods and lightning strikes kill thousands of people in India each year. Scientists are warning that rising global temperatures are fuelling a surge in extreme weather events. Rising land and sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive thunderstorms from where lightning emanates. Rain and hailstorms were expected to continue in western India on Monday. At least 18 of the 24 deaths were attributed to the lightning strikes, officials said in a statement late on Sunday. Gujarat state was hit by heavy rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms and hailstorms on Sunday and Monday, with some areas receiving up to 144mm (5.7 inches) of rain in 24 hours, Reuters news agency reported citing state government data. The collision of three weather systems over Gujarat caused the lightning strikes, according to Manorama Mohanty, head of the Indian Metrological Department in Ahmedabad. ""These are the easterly winds flowing from the Arabian Sea, the Western Disturbance over the Western Himalayas and the Cyclonic Circulation over South Gujarat,"" Ms Mohanty told BBC Gujarati. India's Home Minister Amit Shah said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the deaths, adding that local authorities were engaging in relief work. Farmer Yogesh Patel, 42, died on his farm when lightning hit a tree he was sheltering under in heavy rain. Shantilal Patel, a close family friend, told the BBC that Mr Patel is survived by his three children and a wife. ""He was in his farm below a tree when the lightning hit him. When we saw his body, it seemed that the mobile phone in his left pocket of shirt was blasted due to lightning which killed him on the spot,"" she said. In India, lightning strikes killed more than 100,000 people between 1967 and 2019, according to official data. This is more than a third of fatalities caused by natural hazards during this period. The number of lightning strikes in the country is also rising - but reported fatalities have been decreasing in recent years as the authorities improve their management of lightning risk, including forecasting and early warning systems. India recorded more than 18 million lightning strikes between April 2020 and March 2021, according to a study by the non-profit Climate Resilient Observing Systems Promotion Council. This was a 34% rise over a similar period during the previous year.

For hundreds of years, people have shaped the world around them for their benefit: They drained lakes to protect infrastructure, wealth and people. They dug up billions of tons of coal, and then oil and gas, to fuel empires and economies. The allure of exploiting nature and burning fossil fuels as a path to prosperity hopped from nation to nation, each eager to secure their own energy. People who claimed the power to control nature and the energy resources around them saw theenvironmentas a tool to be used for progress, historians say. Over hundreds of years, that impulse has remade the planet's climate, too — and brought its inhabitants to the brink of catastrophe. Mexico City traces its roots to a settlement centuries ago on islands in the midst of Lake Texcoco. These days, most of the lake is gone, drained long ago to make room for the building and growth that today has more than 22 million people sprawling toward the edges of the Valley ofMexico. Getting water in the arid valley — a need that has spiked as droughts have worsened — relies on pumping from deep underground. The toll of centuries of such pumping can be seen in curbs that crumble and structures that tilt atop the resulting subsidence, with some areas sinking around 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) a year. At the same time, neighborhoods are at increased risk of severe flooding because of climate change-fueled extreme rain events and drainage systems that are less effective because of the subsidence. “Nature doesn’t create these huge problems,” said Luis Zambrano, professor of ecology at the National University Autónoma of Mexico. “Nature behaves as nature ... we are increasing our vulnerability by allowing the city to sink by pumping as much water as we possibly can from the aquifer."" Mexico City is just one example of people and empires altering their natural environments in ways they believe will benefit themselves and the land. Elsewhere, huge swathes of land have been deforested for agriculture or livestock grazing, or degraded and contaminated by quarrying and mining for metals and minerals. Tapping nature for its resources drove progress and productivity for some, but it's also been a major driver of emissions and environmental degradation. Anya Zilberstein, a historian of climate science at Concordia University in Montreal, highlighted the example of Europeans colonizing the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries as an early catalyst for modern-day climate and environmental crises. “They bring with them this idea that conquest and then the development of the cultivation of landscapes, like taking down trees, opening up lands to European style agriculture, that the draining of swamps ... will also change the climate, usually for the better,” Zilberstein said. The Aztecs built Tenochtitlán — what became Mexico City — on the lake's islands and chinampas — small, artificial fields. When the city later fell under Spain's rule, it was seen as the “most gorgeous jewel in the Spanish empire,"" with ornate palaces and commercial hubs, said Vera S. Candiani, a historian of Latin America at Princeton. Catastrophic flooding in the mid-16th century led the Spanish to pursue drainage projects that aimed to keep the city dry and prosperous, and stretched on for three centuries, Candiani said. But not everyone benefited equally. Candiani said that capital-owning elites got technicians, engineers and other professionals to implement a system of extracting resources and labor from the countryside to benefit the city in colonial Mexico, and more broadly from the colonies for the gain of the home country. Rural populations, who contributed the most to the project through coerced labor, didn't benefit. Jan Golinski, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire, said Europeans of the time thought that their changes — cutting down forests, draining swamps, plowing land — would change the climate as well, to something closer to their homelands. He said they saw this engineering as positive. “They believed that their society was making progress, that it was gaining greater control over nature, that they were becoming more civilized and were civilizing the environment around them,” Golinski said. It’s a belief that several historians say is rooted in feelings of racial and cultural superiority. “We hear echoes of these tropes"" in the present day, said Deborah Coen, a historian of science at Yale. Being more vulnerable to climate extremes is associated with populations of color, and at the same time, “we find white elites pursuing projects of climate adaptation that protect themselves at the expense of communities of color,” she said. For example, residents in areas that were deemed safer from extreme weather following wildfires in Maui this summer are now getting priced out of their own neighborhoods. The early modern period's ideas on race have “long tentacles into the present,” said Zilberstein, and also solidified notions of environmental control, productivity and growth as positive, making it harder to tackle the current climate crisis. “There are plenty of people who would say, yes, I believe climate change is real and I’ll go on a march, but I can’t accept de-growth,"" she said. “And I understand why businesses won’t commit to it and nations won’t commit to it. It’s sort of unfathomable. It goes against the deeply held ideology of progress.” While Mexico City was built over water, Britain was sitting on vast expanses of coal that would eventually help form the blanket of carbon dioxide emissions that now clogs the atmosphere. Coal had long been used in homes on the island for heating and cooking. It wasn't the only source of energy — timber, water and peat were in use as well — but the balance tipped dramatically in its favor through the late 18th and early 19th centuries through technological inventions like steam power, new transportation routes like canals and later railroads, and a desire to better control how, when and where energy was used. When the steam economy arrived — engines fueled by coal to heat water and make steam power — it made it easier for factory owners to control labor and nature than an economy based on water power, for example, said Andreas Malm, an associate professor of human ecology at Lund University in Sweden. “Steam engines were mobile in space, so you could erect them anywhere, and the great benefit of this was that you could concentrate steam factories in towns where there was access to cheap and disciplined labor power,” said Malm. Steam power was also less vulnerable to the droughts, floods and storms that could affect water power: “You could just turn it on at any point in the day, regardless of the weather outside.” It made coal the central energy-maker for British manufacturing and transport. “Britain forcibly exported this model and integrated other countries such as India or Egypt or what became Nigeria into a kind of an economy that was dependent on fossil fuel,” said Malm. By the mid-19th century, steam power was adopted in manufacturing, cotton mills, steam ships and locomotives around the world, turning coal into a global trade. On Barak, a historian at Tel Aviv University and co-founder of the Laboratory for the History of Climate Change, likened steam engines and coal to the British empire giving other states coffee machines and capsules. Nations consistently needed to buy new capsules, or coal, for their coffee machines, or steam engines, feeding an ongoing addiction. “This kickstarts ... searching for fossil fuels in various places in the Ottoman Empire, in the Indian subcontinent and elsewhere,” he said. And while it led to some discoveries, other empires and nations kept coming back to the more energy-rich British coal. Centuries later, the United Kingdom has nearly weaned itself off coal, with weeks or months at a stretch where the national grid gets no coal power. The U.K. plans to stop using coal for the production of electricity by the end of next year, although it’s still used in heavy industry like steel-making, with a new coal mine approved in Cumbria as late as 2022. But the country’s move away from coal wasn’t before its empire left its sooty footprint around the world. Its legacy can also be seen at home, where many of the mining and port towns in the north of England and parts of Wales and Scotland once buoyed by coal now languish, and abandoned mines and heaps of waste and debris scar the landscape. Previous centuries created the right conditions for human-caused climate change, but the last few generations made it a reality. In 1960, humans put about 9 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the air; in 2021, they produced more than four times that amount, according to the Global Carbon Project. Energy use skyrocketed as cars, air travel and technology became more affordable in many North American and European countries. Other nations such as China, Japan and India were assembling their own energy regimes based on fossil fuels. And this all happened amid growing understanding and concern about heat-trapping gases. Oil use grew in the late 19th century because it wasn't as labor-intensive as coal, an industry whose workers now had strong unions in some Western nations, historians say. Like coal, oil was easy to store. It is more energy-rich than coal, and it's easier to move; as a liquid it can be shipped through pipes, as well as by trucks, tankers and railcars, said J.R. McNeill, a historian at Georgetown University. The rise of automobiles in the 1920s led the U.S. to build its energy system and much of its technology around internal combustion engines that still dominate cars, ships and planes. And as Europe and Japan followed suit, it made the global investment in an oil-dominated fossil fuel regime “gigantic and harder, but not impossible, to reverse or replace,” McNeill said. Meanwhile, coal kept its place in the global economy. In China and Japan, growing consumption was a barometer of economic development by the early 20th century, said Harvard historian of science Victor Seow. After the Communist Revolution in 1949, the Chinese government measured growth by its production of items like cloth, electricity, wheat, iron, steel — and coal, too, which was key measure of growth. Japan studied Western mining to develop its own coal fields in both its home islands and empire. China is the world's current largest greenhouse gas emitter, although the United States still trumps it historically. In India, too, which was part of the British Empire until it gained independence in 1947, coal was used to further the country's development and help state governments win popular support, said Elizabeth Chatterjee, a historian at the University of Chicago. India set up state-owned coal-fired plants and started electrifying its cities and larger farms, with many other rural areas not coming online until the early 21st century. And they electrified while also understanding the environmental risks of coal, she said. “Indira Gandhi, as early as 1981, spoke publicly about climate change, for example, as a threat, but plowed on with this (coal) regardless,"" Chatterjee said. “If you're a country with few resources, what choice do you have?” In the United States, environmental issues started gaining traction in the 1960s and '70s, with the first Earth Day in 1970, said Joshua Howe, an environmental historian at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. He cited major legislation — to create the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Endangered Species Act — as “really big responses to that really big moment.” But tackling fossil fuels — what Howe called “the center of the global economy” — was more difficult. Yale's Coen described fear in the U.S. around discussing how to adapt to weather extremes caused by climate change that were already unavoidable in the late 20th century. Talking about adaptation was seen as a risk to detract from the will to slash emissions, she said. Howe also noted unwillingness to join international climate agreements, including a unanimous U.S. Senate vote in 1997 against signing any climate treaty that would mandate cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. That vote ""was, in my opinion, pretty much when optimism for a national-level commitment to climate mitigation — especially via international agreements — went up in smoke,” Howe said. But many historians agree, amid the gloom of spiraling concerns about the climate and environment, that radical shifts away from centuries-old ideas of progress can shape a better future. Fredrik Albritton Jonsson, a historian at the University of Chicago, said if humans rethink the need for persistent growth, societies can operate within the restrictions of finite resources and atmospheric limits. “There are two kinds of boundaries to this economy,” said Jonsson. “One is a sort of upper boundary of planetary limits” of what our natural world can withstand, “and then there’s a lower boundary, that would guarantee minimum social needs, entitlements, the right to education, the right to clean water, the right to a steady income.” ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

For generations, this community has thrived as a hub of commerce with a bustling market as well as vibrant and hardworking traders who contribute to the South-West’s economic vitality.However, beneath this facade of flourishing commerce and daily life, an issue of critical importance has taken root, threatening not only the livelihoods of its residents but also the very health and well-being of the traders alike.The issue revolves around an indiscriminate refuse dump that has grown in size and notoriety over the years. Initially, it started as an inconspicuous mound, but overtime, it morphed into a menacing presence.This is the sad reality faced by residents, traders and visitors at the Agunloye market in Ado town, Ado-Odo Ota Local government area of Ogun State.The origins of this issue are rooted in a complex web of factors, from insufficient waste management infrastructure to a lack of awareness and regulatory enforcement. Over time, the problem has grown, spreading its influence far beyond the confines of the dumping site. The waste not only poses health risks but also raises questions about the community’s environmental sustainability especially at a time when the state is faced with the outbreak of cholera that has left no fewer than 20 persons dead.This indiscriminate refuse dump is not just an eyesore; it is also a looming health hazard, affecting the lives of residents and traders, including children, who depended on the nearby marketplace for their livelihoods. The dump site is a breeding ground for diseases, a potential time bomb that could unleash a wave of health crises upon the traders and their families.Residents, traders groanApproaching the market, one can easily sight some of the traders, who, perhaps, do not have other alternatives where they can sell their goods, covering their noses as a way of preventing the odour oozing out from the heap of refuse located at the centre of the market to find its way into their belly.Musa, a pepper vendor in the market, with his salt-and-peppered beard, has been a figure in the marketplace for decades. His wrinkled face tells the story of countless sunrise and sunsets spent trading in the market. “I’ve seen this place change,” he said, gazing at the refuse dump. “It used to be clean and green. Now, we’re living in fear of diseases because of that dump.” He stressed further that, “If you observed well, the refuse heap is some metres away from houses across the market. If you get to our health centre, there are several reports of health issues which had been linked to the refuse dump. Although the market activities come up every five days, the dangers of the odour coming from the market have put the residents at health risks.”Mrs Risikat Obe, a middle-aged woman with a warm smile, has been selling her wares in the marketplace for years. “This place is my lifeline,” she said. “But every day, I worry about my health and my customers’ health too. This refuse has caused sickness to residents of this area due to the stench coming out from the refuse heap. We are at the risk of diseases because of the odour that comes from the refuse heap especially when it rains.”Martin Owusu, a plastic patcher with a penchant for storytelling, reflected on his daily struggles. “I’ve patched countless of pairs of plastic,” he said, ‘But the dump keeps growing, and with it, our troubles. I am mostly affected by the odour coming from this refuse. Anytime I set out to come to this market, my heart skips in anticipation of the bad smell I will be exposed to. At a point, I had to get zinc to block this part (pointing to the side of the refuse closer to his stall) so that it would not roll over to my stall but whenever it rains, the odour is always unbearable. Something has to be done about the refuse dump.”Elder Jimoh Ojugbele, a revered figure, remembered the market’s history. “I’ve seen this place transform,” he reflected. “We used to take pride in our environment but now, this refuse dump has overshadowed our legacy.”He expressed fear that his daily exposure to the odour coming from the refuse might send him to his grave. “I am an old man, I have been weaving mats and baskets for a long time in this market. I still continue in this work to keep myself active but it is so sad that I am now exposed to stench oozing from this refuse. My plan is to enjoy my old days while keeping myself active with the profession I’ve loved and do most part of my life but it is a pity that I can’t seem to enjoy myself again. This odour is beginning to cause sickness and I fear it may lead to death.“I am now entangled in-between staying at home and being hungry or coming to the market and getting exposed to this danger, but I don’t have any choice than to come to the market because of survival. If the government cannot help the aged persons like me, they should at least alleviate this pain caused by the refuse,” he narrated with a grin face.Schoolchildren at riskThe marketplace is not the only place within the community that suffers from indiscriminate refuse dump. On the land hosting the Alamuwa Grammar School is a heap of refuse that has taken over a large expanse of the land. Opposite this heap and within an arm’s length is located Olaiya Primary School.Passing through the location of this refuse, our correspondent was greeted with a bad smell emanating from the refuse which was closer to the learning environment of students of Olaiya Primary School.The school’s headmaster, Adesina Yahya, lamented that students of the School are being exposed to the refuse which had grown over the years.“I joined this school in 2018 and this was the situation I met. I was so concerned because I know the health implications of having a school close to a dumpsite especially when the students are young ones. I have made several efforts to see that something could be done but nothing has come up. What I do to manage the situation is to ensure that we burn the refuse regular so that we can mitigate the level of stench coming out from it. The situation is worrisome,” Yahya lamented.A source in the Alamuwa Grammar School noted that though the dump site is situated on the school’s land, the distance between the dumpsite and classrooms has made the impact minimal on the students except for those who may just be passing by the route.Open refuse dump can cause diseases, air pollution, expertsThe indiscriminate refuse dump at the centre of the market located within the heart of the community not only blights the landscape but poses severe health risks that have raised deep concerns for experts.A 2014 study published in the journal ‘Environmental Health Perspectives’, examined the impact of solid waste disposal on the incidence of cholera.The researchers found that areas with improper solid waste disposal had a significantly higher risk of cholera outbreaks, even after having control over other risk factors. They also noted that the risk was higher during the rainy season when heavy rains can cause flooding and the spreading of contaminated water.Another finding of the study was that the risk of cholera was particularly high in informal settlements, where a majority of the residents do not have access to proper sanitation facilities.Related NewsGovernorship Election Live UpdatesOver 46,000 living with HIV/AIDS in Ogun, says commissionerResidents recover decomposing body of newborn in Ogun communityTinubu inherited govt almost in a coma, says Ogun governorOverall, the researchers concluded that improving solid waste disposal would be an important step in reducing the risk of cholera.In another study by Felicia Babs-Shomoye and Russell Kabir, published by the Journal of Public Health in Developing Countries, the researchers found that open dumping is very common in developing countries like Nigeria, and poses a risk to human health and the environment. Waste not properly managed has been known to have a negative impact on health, environment and aesthetic values.It was also found that waste dumps near living areas are detrimental to good health. Waste dump can serve as a breeding ground for mosquitoes, fly, rodents and rats. These animals can transmit diseases to human beings either from the waste dump itself or other related sources. Inappropriate disposal of solid waste could be risky which often manifests by contamination of surface and ground water through leachate, air pollution by burning of wastes, soil contamination through direct waste contact, uncontrolled release of methane by anaerobic decomposition of waste or spreading of diseases by different vectors like birds, insects and rodents.To corroborate the above, a Lagos-based environmentalist, Dr Hassan Sanuth, noted that any refuse dump in a marketplace posed a threat to the environment as it could result in land and water pollution which can be detrimental to the health of the residents.refuse dumpsite opposite Olaiya Primary SchoolHe said, “Indiscriminate refuse dump in a community causes pollution of the air, land and surface or underground water. Air pollution resulting from putrification of organic compound in the waste thereby releasing gaseous pollutants such as methane, carbon dioxide as well as oxides of nitrogen and sulphides with their characteristic odours.“Land Pollution resulted from the accumulation of this refuse, littering, as well as residual presence of organic and inorganic compound in the soil. Sometimes, with some metals that may bioaccumulate in agricultural products thereby rendering the soil non suitable for farming and the likes.”Apart from air pollution, Sanatu noted that the water sources around a dumpsite could also be contaminated which can pose threat to the quality of water generated from boreholes and wells within the environment.“Water pollution due to the seepage or transport of the waste and components into the surface water bodies (Rivers, lagoon, lakes etc.) that are being used for domestic and commercial purposes in the community. Also could pollute the underground water (Borehole and Wells) through percolation of these components into the ground.“Accumulation on land may lead to breeding of diseases vectors, degradation of land, death of sensitive biodiversity in water and on land. Long-term impact could include food insecurity, disease outbreak and socio-economic loss,” he concluded.Speaking on the impact of the refuse dump on public health, a Public health expert, Professor Tanimola Akande, noted that communities with indiscriminate refuse dump are at risk of diseases like malaria, diarrhea and respiratory illnesses.“Refuse dump is a common feature of many towns and cities in Nigeria. This is as a result of poor waste disposal. Refuse dumps are risk factors to some diseases that are spread through contamination of water sources. They also provide breeding place for mosquitoes and rodents.“These may lead to diseases like malaria and diarrhoea diseases. Burning of refuse dumps also cause air pollution that may lead to respiratory diseases Sight of refuse dumps can also have social and psychological effects,” Akande said.Pleas for help met with unfulfilled promises“We have made efforts to reach out to the local government authorities but they said the vehicles that can be used to evacuate the refuse are not working and since then it has been promises upon promises,” says Batunde Bakare, the Ado market leader.He was not left alone in the quest for finding solution to the looming hazard that the refuse dump posed. Community leaders like Mrs Amoleogun and Adeyinka Adelaja, also recounted how their plea for solution has been met with unfulfilled promises. “We’ve reached out to local authorities but nothing has been done,” Amoleogun and Adelaja echoed in unison.Efforts were made by the Ado-Odo Area Community Development Association executives. The chairman of the community association, Shafar Asade, said, “We have made several effort to see that the refuse is being removed from the market but nothing has been achieved. Personally, I put a call to the Local government chairman but he did not pick my calls, I also sent him a message on WhatsApp which was not replied to even when it showed that my message has been read. I later learnt that he forwarded the message to the Health Educator in our zone here who came to inspect the refuse but nothing has been done still.”We are working on a solution, government reactsThe response of government authorities to the refuse dump issue has been a topic of great interest and scrutiny. It’s a challenge that has spurred action, as government officials recognize the gravity of the situation.The state’s Commissioner for Environment, Ola Oresanya, shares his perspective: “We acknowledge the community’s concerns, and we’re committed to a sustainable solution. We are working to enhance waste disposal and provide the necessary resources to address this challenge.“Our plan is to distribute big waste containers to markets. The situation of refuse is mostly in rural communities, if you get to markets in urban areas across the State, you cannot see situation like this. Markets in Abeokuta, Ijebu-Ode, Mowe and Sagamu are well monitored. It is not as if we neglected those communities. Now that you have informed me, necessary action will be taken,” Oresanya concluded.Experts advocate for awareness, proper waste management to tackle indiscriminate refuse dumpStressing on how indiscriminate refuse dump can be curbed in the community, Professor Akande noted that constant awareness and proper waste management by relevant agencies can help to prevent the menace and prevent the mitigating effects that could arise from it.He said, “There are preventive measures to indiscriminate refuse disposal. This includes proper waste management from home level up to community level. Wastes generated from residences and workplaces need to be properly disposed of in covered waste bins in preparation for evacuation to final disposal using environmentally friendly methods. The evacuation of refuse needs to be done regularly to prevent being risk to health of people.“Communities need to work closely and cooperate with environmental health officers in ensuring that wastes are regularly and properly disposed of. Government at all levels needs to address the challenge of indiscriminate refuse disposal by providing a means for waste disposal and prompt evacuation of such wastes. Appropriate sanctions need to be put in place against those who practise improper waste disposal. Government needs to encourage the various waste to wealth schemes.”In his submission, Sanatu, corroborated the opinion of Professor Akande stating that proper sensitisation of residents in the community and establishment of a waste disposing point is necessary to prevent the environmental and health issues associated with indiscriminate refuse dump.“Relevant advocacy and awareness campaign be instituted in the community, designation of waste deposition point, encouragement of sorting and recycling of waste materials (plastics, metal, paper etc.) while organic waste can go nutrient enrichment/compost,” Sanatu concluded.

Michele Haider raised concerns with Runnymede council in 2007, before her father Syed Haider died in 2012. He had an allotment in Chertsey that closed in 2003 due to contamination. Runnymede council said inquiries took place and allotment holders were contacted at the time, with people advised not to eat the produce. Mrs Haider said her family had first-hand experience of landfill in the area, because they had lived at Thorpe Lea. That area, close to Chertsey and the M3/M25 junction and not far from Heathrow, had seen a landfill experiment in flooded, worked-out gravel pits in the 1950s. One pit remained a dump into the 1990s. Mrs Haider, who lived there from the 70s to the 90s, remembers the pits as ""ugly, chained up and locked up and even as kids you wouldn't want to go exploring there"". She said the family went walking, but returned to find ""black viscous mud"" on their boots that never dried. Her parents later moved to Mead Lane, Chertsey, not far from the allotments where the family grew radicchio, French beans and runner beans and gathered blackberries growing wild. Mr Haider pulled carrots from the ground and washed them to eat there. His wife, Giuseppina, cooked the produce and made preserves and the family lived off the land. His daughter made organic baby food. Now, fearing it was contaminated, she said: ""It makes me sad."" The allotments they farmed from 1996 to 2003 were at Painesfield in Eastworth Road and at Beomonds in Heriot Road. Both sites closed in 2003. Painesfield closed for redevelopment, but Beomonds closed after contamination was found. In 2004, Mrs Haider and her mother developed an underactive thyroid. Mrs Haider's son developed the condition later. Syed Haider was diagnosed with the blood cancer, myelodysplasia. Mrs Haider made a freedom of information request in 2007 amid concerns for the family's health. She received several reports but said information was ""buried in scientific language"". She wrote in the request: ""I would like to know more about the contamination as it may have had an impact on the health of my father and other members of our family."" Runnymede council has provided all the reports it still holds to the BBC. Documents showed vegetables grown at Beomonds were contaminated with heavy metals and the source was a pond that had been filled in and remains fenced-off. A report in 2003 said no metals detected exceeded the critical concentration at which plant toxicity effects become apparent, but metals were accumulative in the human body and consumption of food with higher than normal metal levels posed a risk. Soil samples contained arsenic, cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, zinc and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which have been linked to cancer. Glass bottles, ceramics, coal fragments, ash and clinker were thought to be filling material for the pond. Lead in water samples exceeded drinking water standards. The report also looked at leachates - contaminated water from waste disposal sites. It found it was highly likely leached contaminants could move during annual flooding and spread across the land. A further document looked at questions that might arise. It said many factors affected health and ""it may be impossible"" to determine whether anyone who had eaten the vegetables was at increased risk. A council spokesman said: ""The decision was made to stop using the land for the growing of vegetables but to allow the land to be used as an informal public open space."" He added: ""Groundwater investigations were carried out at Beomonds to assess groundwater risk from the infilled pit area, [the] outcome was a conclusion of no risk."" Mrs Haider said she requested an inquest after her father's death, but a post-mortem found 78-year-old Mr Haider died from heart disease and no inquest was held. She said questions resurfaced after Zane Gbangbola's death during flooding of the River Thames in 2014. Zane's parents said their seven-year-old son was killed by toxic gas washed out of landfill. ""I felt frightened,"" she said. ""My father was elderly when he died, but this was a little boy and I felt it had happened again."" Ten years on, she wants accountability. ""People know in Chertsey things were buried in Chertsey. There will be another flood and God knows what is buried there,"" she said. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

The figure represented a sharp 135 percent increase over 2021, the UK-based charity said in an analysis ahead of the COP28 climate summit opening in Dubai on Thursday. It said children made up nearly half the 57 million people pushed into crisis levels of acute food insecurity or worse across 12 countries because of extreme weather in 2022, according to data from the IPC hunger monitoring system. Out of the 12, countries in the Horn of Africa were most affected, with Ethiopia and Somalia accounting for about half of the 27 million children facing hunger, Save said. ""As climate-related weather events become more frequent and severe, we will see more drastic consequences on children's lives,"" Save's CEO Inger Ashing said in a statement. The charity called on leaders meeting at COP28 in Dubai to take action on the climate crisis by recognising children as ""key agents of change"" but more broadly to address other causes of food insecurity such as conflict and weak health systems. Save highlighted the situation in Somalia, which is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, locked in a vicious cycle of drought and floods. It said the recent torrential rains and flooding that have engulfed many parts of the country had displaced about 650,000 people, about half of them children. Elsewhere, Save noted that two million children in Pakistan remained acutely malnourished after floods that swamped a third of the country last year. Across the planet, Save estimated that 774 million children -- or one third of the global child population -- are living with the dual impacts of poverty and high climate risk. In a report issued last week, Save said that more than 17.6 million children will be born into hunger this year, one-fifth more than a decade ago.","['uk', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'ethiopia', 'somalia', 'somalia', 'pakistan']",us,False,False

[+] commitment emerges yet again. Governments agreed in 2010 that developed countries would commit $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries better manage the impacts of climate change—notably, extreme weather events like droughts and floods—and pay for adaptation measures to move away from fossil fuels and toward renewables. That was at the UN climate conference COP16, seven years ago. As COP28 kicks off this week in Dubai, the seemingly eternal question of fulfilling the $100 billion commitment emerges yet again. The Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development suggests, based on unverified data, that the target has finally been met. But even if this is the case, the International Energy Agency is clear that trillions, not billions, of dollars are needed to move the world to a net zero economy, removing as many greenhouse gases as it emits. Given this fact, governments need, during the climate talks in Dubai, to do much more to mobilize private finance to fill this huge funding gap. The idea was that this $100 billion could come from a mixture of private and public sources based on bilateral or multilateral agreements, like the Green Climate Fund, set up to mobilize adaptation financing. However, there was no distinct amount set for adaptation or mitigation, just a single annual sum that should be met. At COP21 in 2015, the Paris Agreement set down that developed countries would continue to mobilize $100 billion of funding a year through to 2025 and that prior to 2025, nations would agree upon a new goal for the following years. Two years ago, at COP26 in Glasgow, however, it was clear that nations had not fulfilled the 2020 goal for a number of reasons, one of which was a lack of private finance. Part of the problem is that it is not clear what “climate finance” actually means, and it is hardly unsurprising that the $100 billion target has not been met when neither governments nor private investors fully understand what they are investing in or which investments should be counted as “climate finance.” If, for example, financing goes to reinforcing a bridge, is that climate finance since the bridge will be subject to more wear and tear due to storm surges or is it just general infrastructure financing? Experts are working on this problem, but even without such additional confusion, it is safe to say that climate financing needs to be stepped up. Total climate finance provided by developed countries in 2021 came to $89.6 billion, a 7.6% increase compared to 2020, according to the OECD. The percentage increase is far higher than that of previous years, and it is wonderful to see mobilized private finance revert back to 2019 levels, reaching $14.4 billion in 2021 after a dip in 2020. Yet two issues are in clear need of attention. The first is that out of this figure, only a relatively small amount, $24.6 billion, was spent on adaptation measures, with the majority of the money going to mitigation projects. Further, this figure has decreased in recent years. The second is that the majority of this funding came from public sources. Tackling both issues presents a substantial challenge, but it is certainly possible at COP28 to set in motion measures that will bring about change. First, ideally there would be agreement in Dubai to substantially increase both mitigation and adaptation financing, encouraged by individual targets. Second, participants need to officially recognize that public funding alone will not be enough to fund both mitigation and adaptation needs and they need to agree on a way forward to urgently unlock private finance. We recently published a paper at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership entitled “Everything, everywhere, all at once,” which examines the challenges and proposed solutions for unlocking private capital. It suggests options for strengthening risk management and guarantees, enhancing data transparency, incentivizing the private sector and supporting diverse and innovative financing models. Promoting diverse financing models can diversify risks, making climate investments more bankable and attractive, potentially accelerating the pace of climate finance and enhancing its effectiveness in fostering sustainable development. These structures might include originate-and-share or originate-and-transfer models, whereby instead of banks keeping loans on their balance sheets until maturity, they distribute the loans, potentially freeing up billions of dollars in additional financing. One promising model to unlock more private finance is the Bridgetown initiative. This proposal was put forward by Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, ahead of COP27 in Egypt in 2022. It sets down ways to reform the global financial system to ensure that it can increase climate resilience and finance the Sustainable Development Goals, while also dealing with the debt and high inflation crises facing poorer countries. The Bridgetown Initiative asks for an increase in the lending for climate and for the Sustainable Development Goals from multilateral development banks to help boost investment in areas including climate resilience, water security and access to renewable energy. Our paper also makes it clear that collaboration must be at the heart of all of these actions if climate goals are to be met in line with the Paris Agreement. If the $100 billion goal has finally been met in 2022, this is a marker of progress, which should help move forward the climate negotiations at COP28. Yet, this figure is, in truth, paltry compared to the $1 trillion or more that will be needed annually by 2025 to meet the climate needs of poorer nations. The pressure is on in Dubai to unlock the multitude of opportunities that private finance can provide and substantially increase the provision of finance to all emerging and developing economies.","['unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedarabemirates', 'unitedkingdom', 'barbados', 'not found', 'egypt']",us,False,False

That's the amount countries have agreed to limit warming to by the end of the century. The world is already perilously close to that number. Since the Industrial Revolution, the planet has warmed by about 1.2 degrees Celsius, predominantly due to heat-trapping emissions that come from burning fossil fuels. This year is expected to be the hottest on record, withtemperatures in Septemberreaching 1.8 degrees Celsius above average. Currently, theworld is on track for just under 3 degreesCelsius of warming (more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century. While a few degrees of difference may seem small, climate research shows that every tenth of a degree can have a profound effect when it comes to the dangers posed by extreme weather. ""We're not destined for some catastrophic climate,"" says Deepti Singh, who is an assistant professor at Washington State University. ""We know that we can have a future that is more equitable and less volatile if we limit the warming through our actions today."" Here are three climate impacts that get substantially worse in the U.S. if the world exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. When scientists use numbers like 1.5 degrees Celsius to measure climate change, it represents an average of all the annual temperatures worldwide. That average masks the fact that some parts of the planet are heating up faster than others. Loading... In fact, the U.S. is warming up at a faster rate than the global average, which means the effects of climate change will be more pronounced. That difference has to do with how the extra heat is absorbed, as well as regional weather patterns. Generally,warming is happening faster on landand in the polar regions. ""The U.S. has already warmed at a rate that's higher than the global average,"" says Singh. ""We're warming at a rate that's 60% higher than that."" Hurricanes and tropical storms are getting more intense as the climate warms, but they aren't the only storms affected. Even regular rainstorms are getting more extreme. ""Every time we have a heavy rainfall event, it's more likely to be even heavier than what we're typically used to seeing,"" says Deanna Hence, assistant professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. ""So that can mean flooding and other risks that come with those really high rainfall rates."" The air in a hotter atmosphere can hold more water vapor, which can fuel heavier rainfall. That means that beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, cities in the Midwest and Northeast will be faced with dramatically more water, which can overwhelm storm drains and infrastructure, causing flooding. Today,most cities aren't designing their infrastructureto handle more intense rain. Heat waves take a massive and sometimeshidden toll in the U.S., causing cardiovascular and other health impacts, in addition to deaths. Climate science shows they're already getting longer and more intense. Nighttime temperatures are also increasing, which exacerbates the effects of a heat wave. Humans, animals and plants need recovery time from extreme daytime temperatures. Without it, health impacts and crop losses are even greater. As the planet warms, winters will also be affected. The number of days below freezing would shrink past 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, especially in the Mountain West. That could impair the snowpack that provides a vital water source for millions of people.Warmer winterscan also harm crops and increase vector-borne diseases.","['unitedarabemirates', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'us', 'india']",us,True,False

Published by independent think tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), the report said the climate-vulnerable country had extreme weather on 86 per cent of days from January to September. The CSE said 2,923 people died, almost two million hectares of crops were ruined, 80,000 homes were destroyed and more than 92,000 animals were killed. But these numbers might be even higher because not all the data is collected, it said. ""'India 2023: An assessment of extreme weather events' attempts to build an evidence base on the frequency and expanding geography of extreme weather events in the country. As this assessment clearly shows, what the country has witnessed so far in 2023 is the new 'abnormal' in a warming world,"" said the CSE director general Sunita Narain . Research indicates that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense worldwide due to climate change, primarily caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. In 2015, countries agreed in Paris to limit the average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels (1850-1900). Multiple reports suggest that the world is significantly off track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To achieve this goal, countries together need to halve the emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by 2030. According to the CSE report that came out ahead of the launch of the 28th round of the UN climate conference in Dubai, Madhya Pradesh reported the highest number of extreme weather events at 138. However, the largest number of deaths occurred in Bihar (642), followed by Himachal Pradesh (365) and Uttar Pradesh (341). Punjab recorded the highest number of animal deaths while Himachal Pradesh reported the most damaged houses due to extreme weather events. In the southern region, Kerala saw the highest count of extreme weather days (67) and deaths (60). Telangana suffered maximum effect on crop area (over 62,000 hectares). The state also witnessed high animal casualties (645). Karnataka faced severe destruction, with over 11,000 houses demolished. In northwest India, Uttar Pradesh had the most extreme weather days at 113. Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, and Rajasthan were also significantly affected. In the eastern and northeastern regions, Assam registered maximum extreme weather events (102), with the state losing 159 livestock and over 48,000 hectares of crops devastated. Nagaland saw over 1,900 houses destroyed. The CSE said January was slightly warmer than average, while February broke records, becoming the warmest in 122 years. India had its sixth driest February and the driest August in 122 years. It said lightning and storms were the most common disasters, occurring on 176 out of 273 days and claiming 711 lives. Most of these deaths occurred in Bihar. However, the most significant devastation came from heavy rains, floods, and landslides, causing over 1,900 casualties. According to research conducted by a different think tank, more than 80 per cent of Indians live in districts vulnerable to climate risks .

A giant being awoken by climate chaos. Together, Antarctica and Greenland are melting well over three times faster than they were in the early 1990s. It is profoundly shocking to stand on the ice of Antarctica and hear directly from scientists how fast the ice is disappearing. New figures show that this September, Antarctic sea ice was 1.5 million square kilometres smaller than the average for the time of year - an area roughly equal to the combined size of Portugal, Spain, France and Germany. And this year, Antarctic sea ice hit an all-time low. That matters for us all. What happens in Antarctica doesn't stay in Antarctica. We live in an interconnected world. Melting sea ice means rising seas. And that directly endangers lives and livelihoods in coastal communities across the globe. Floods and saltwater intrusion imperil crops and drinking water - threatening food and water security. Homes are no longer insurable. Coastal cities and entire small islands risk being lost to the seas. And vital natural systems are at risk of being disrupted. The movement of waters around Antarctica distributes heat, nutrients and carbon around the world, helping to regulate our climate and regional weather patterns. But that system is slowing as the Southern Ocean grows warmer and less dense. Further slowdown - or entire breakdown - would spell catastrophe. The cause of all this destruction is clear: The fossil fuel pollution coating the Earth and heating the planet. Without changing course, we're heading towards a calamitous three-degree Celsius temperature rise by the end of the century. Sea surface temperatures are already at record highs. If we continue as we are, and I strongly hope we will not, the Greenland and West Antarctica ice sheets will cross a deadly tipping point. This alone would ultimately push up sea levels by around ten meters. We are trapped in a deadly cycle. Ice reflects the sun's rays. As it vanishes, more heat is absorbed into the Earth's atmosphere. That means more heating, which means more storms, floods, fires and droughts across the globe. And more melting. Which means, with less ice, even more heating. At COP28, which starts later this week, leaders must break this cycle. The solutions are well known. Leaders must act to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, protect people from climate chaos, and end the fossil fuel age. We need a global commitment to triple renewables, double energy efficiency, and bring clean power to all, by 2030. We need a clear and credible commitment to phase out fossil fuels on a timeframe that aligns with the 1.5-degree limit. And we need climate justice - setting the world up for a huge increase in investment in adaptation and loss and damage to protect people from climate extremes. Antarctica is crying out for action. I salute the thousands of researchers - in Antarctica and around the world - expanding our understanding of the changes taking place on the continent.
