The National party’s Christopher Luxon is leading Labour’s Chris Hipkins in the race to become New Zealand’s next prime minister, but any victory could depend on the support of smaller right-wing and populist parties. Less than a year after Jacinda Ardern, the darling of the international community,passed the leadershipto Hipkins, New Zealand’s left-leaning Labour party is facing an election where many of its trademark policies – from green farming to Maori co-governance – could be rolled back if the centre-right Nationals take power on October 14 as the opinion polls suggest. Four years since the devastatingChristchurch Mosque attacks, which were carried out by an Australian white supremacist, there are also concerns about the tone of the campaigning. “I think some of our politicians are certainly playing the race card in this election,” Hipkins said during a debate last month between the leaders of the two main parties. Hipkins questioned Luxon’s willingness to work with the New Zealand First party, quoting a racist statement made by one of the party’s candidates. The centre-right Nationals are leading in the polls but may need one or both of New Zealand First and the AMP party, another populist right wing party, to be able to form a government. Responding to Hipkins’s reference to racist campaigning, Luxon told Hipkins he was willing to “make the call” to work with New Zealand First if it meant “stopping you, Te Pati Maori and the Greens coming to power”. Labour’s current government is a coalition with the Green party, while Te Pati Maori is a smaller party representing New Zealand’s Indigenous Maori population who make up about 17 percent of the nation’s five million people. Racist campaigning during the election has not been limited to speeches made to loyal followers. It has also spilt over into action, fuelling concern among the country’s Muslim and Maori leaders. Hana Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, Te Pati Maori’s youngest candidate, has experienced a “string of attacks”, including an intruder inside her home, according to the party. We are excited to announce Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke as our candidate for Hauraki-Waikato. Hana is an activist, published author and expert on the maramataka and taiao, and at 20 years old represents a new generation of Māori political leadership.pic.twitter.com/4eDOa9Yp7N — Te Pāti Māori (@Maori_Party)June 28, 2023 Te Pati Maori President John Tamihere said it was “clear” that the attacks against Maipi-Clarke were “politically motivated as the perpetrator is a well-known advocate and campaigner for the National Party”, a claim the National Party has denied. The situation prompted 30 Maori leaders to write anopen lettertwo weeks before the election stating: “Racism, in any form, should have no place in our elections.” Christchurch Mosque shooting recommendations shelved Aliya Danzeisen, the national coordinator of the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand told Al Jazeera that recent attacks during the election “underscore” whyrecommendationsfrom New Zealand’s Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Christchurch Mosque attacks “should have been implemented three years ago”. Earlier this year, Hipkins shelved new hate speech laws – one of the commission’s recommendations – claiming cost of living pressures were more urgent. Danzeisen said there has been a “significant lack of commitment” to implement recommendations that could protect “vulnerable communities from targeting and dehumanising speech” and that she says would make New Zealand “a safer nation”. Fifty-one people were killed when a lone gunman attacked Muslim worshippers at the mosque in the largest city in New Zealand’s South Island in March 2019. In its 800-page report, the commission found intelligence services had been distracted from investigating right-wing threats because of a focus on the “threat of Islamist extremist” activity. Agriculture, New Zealand’s biggest industry, is another key issue in Saturday’s elections. Some farmers are concerned about the costs of implementing the world’s first “fart tax“, even as their farms are at risk from intensifying climate disasters. There are an estimated six million cows and 26 million sheep in the country. In February, after Cyclone Gabrielle left many New Zealand farms underwater, with mudslides, flattened trees and animals in need of rescue, New Zealand’s government quickly announced tens of millions of dollars in emergency grants. But in the lead-up to the election, some farmers have been vocal about the potential costs of Labour’s tax on methane emissions from livestock, which is set to be introduced in 2025. Nicola Harvey, author of FARM: the making of a climate activist, told Al Jazeera that the Labour and National parties had been “pumping the brakes on agriculture regulations in order to get votes”. Harvey’s cattle farm was among those hit by storms earlier this year – after she had published her book looking at the role farmers can play in addressing the climate crisis. Another “contentious debate” is the potential lifting of New Zealand’s long-standing ban on genetically modified crops, she said. Harvey says some parties have changed their position on the ban because genetically modified crops could help build resilience to climate change, but she questions whether this makes sense as it concentrates “yet more power with the big agriculture companies”. While Ardern is travelling the world, and has a new position as a senior fellow at Harvard University in the United States, back in New Zealand her successor has struggled to maintain the comfortable lead that Ardern – whose popularity stretched well beyond New Zealand’s borders – enjoyed. Compounding his problems, hefell sick with COVID-19just two weeks before the election and had to take campaigning online. While Ardern remains a popular presence at international meetings, back at home different parties have different views on how, and if, New Zealand should engage with the world, as well as with China and the United States. One reason why Labour may not again get to form the government is because New Zealand First’s Winston Peters has ruled out working with the party again and may instead help the Nationals. Peters previously served as foreign minister under a coalition government with Labour from 2005 to 2008 and again from 2017 to 2020. As foreign minister, he introduced the Pacific Reset policy in 2018, to improve New Zealand’s relations with its neighbouring countries at a time when China had begun increasing its presence in the region. If Peters returns to the position of foreign minister he would potentially replaceLabour’s Nanaia Mahuta, a daughter of Maori royalty. By contrast the ACT, another potential coalition partner for the Nationals, wants to shut down New Zealand’s ministry for the advancement of Pacific People. ACT is also more outspoken on geopolitical issues than many New Zealand parties. Its leader David Seymour attended a pro-Hong Kong democracy protest in Auckland in 2019 – and the party wants to increase New Zealand’s historically low defence spending to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) from less than 1 percent. In recent years New Zealand – or Aotearoa as it is known in Maori language – has been making progress in reviving Maori culture and recognising Maori co-governance, more than 180 years after the British Crown and Maori leaders signed theTreaty of Waitangi. But both ACT and New Zealand First have run on platforms that push back against some of the perceived gains made by Maori people, even as the Indigenous population continues to experience systemic inequality. “I call on Maori women to respond at this time in our history by attending at the polling booths in numbers never seen before,” Annette Sykes, a Rotorua activist and lawyer who has been active in efforts to revive Maori culture and self-governance, told Al Jazeera. Voting is not compulsory in New Zealand, although more than 80 percent of enrolled voters voted in the last election in 2020 when Ardern won in a landslide. Sykes said this year’s poll was an opportunity to “examine and to redefine the terms upon which we will live and work and care for our homelands as our ancestors did”. By “voting in record numbers” said Sykes, Maori women could “reaffirm our power confirmed in the founding documents of the modern Aotearoa-New Zealand nation state”. Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Once intensified, it will be identified as Cyclone Hamoon, a name suggested by Iran. At present, there is no severe weather, be it in the form of heavy rainfall, strong winds or others, forecast for India’s east coast. On Monday morning, the system lay as a deep depression at about 400 km south of Paradip, Odisha, 550 km south-southwest of Digha, West Bengal, and 690 km south-southwest of Khepupara in Bangladesh. As per the IMD’s latest projected cyclone track, Hamoon would weaken as it nears the Bangladesh coast. The system is set to cross at a location between Khepupara and Chittagong on Wednesday. For a week now, the North Indian Ocean — comprising the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea — have remained highly active. The post-monsoon months between October and December are prone to cyclonic storms, with November being the most favourable for the development of storms. Extremely severe Cyclone Tejhas gathered force over the west-central Arabian Sea and is headed towards Yemen. “Cyclone Tej is likely to cross the Yemen coast close to Al-Ghaidah during the early hours of Tuesday. It will make a landfall as very severe cyclonic storm, with wind speed of 125 to 135 km/hr, gusting to 150 km/hr,” the IMD said in its national weather bulletin on Monday morning. According to the 5.30 am satellite observations, Cyclone Tej was 200 km north-northwest of Socotra, Yemen, 300 km south of Salalah, Oman and 240 km southeast of Al Ghaidah in Yemen."

According to scientists, Cyclone Tej is headed in the northwesterly direction ringing in rain activity in Yemen, owing to whichMumbaias well as the entire west coast is slated to receive no rainfall even after the cyclone’s complete development. Sushma Nair toldThe Indian Express, “Currently, Cyclone Tej has formed a deep depression and within the next 24 hours, it will develop completely. However, the cyclone is slated to bring activity in Yemen and if it travels, then, it will result in developments in Oman. It must be noted that Cyclone Tej is nowhere near the west coast owing to which neither Mumbai nor any other parts of the country will receive showers because of this cyclone. The AQI levels could have gone down had there been any rain activity. But now, the AQI will remain unaffected.” Read Death By Breath Series – Mumbai holds its breath|Why construction dust is lethal|BMC’s rulebook gets a burial A mere two weeks after the withdrawal of monsoon, Mumbai has been reeling under burgeoning AQI levels as well as high temperatures in the ongoing week. While the average AQI on Monday touched 184 in Mumbai, on Wednesday, as the city’s temperature soared to a four-year high for October, levels of PM10 — Particulate Matter. A day earlier, Mumbai’s overall AQI touched 191, way worse thanDelhi’s 84. Responding to questions from Express, Nair explained, “Currently, the wind circulation has been such that the air couldn’t rise because of which dust particles remained suspended in the air resulting in rising AQI levels.” Meanwhile, Mahesh Palawat from Skymet Weather Services added that dust from construction sites, dry weather, high temperatures and lack of winds have resulted in the increased AQI levels in the city, post monsoon withdrawal. On Friday, pockets of Mumbai Metropolitan Region experienced light drizzle which meteorologists as well as weather experts attributed to a trough in the north coast of Maharashtra. Despite the showers, they maintained that the AQI level will not witness a decline. Speaking to The Indian Express, Palawat said, “There is a small trough in the north coast of Maharashtra which may bring light rain but it won’t prevail. The AQI levels in the city are not slated to drop unless there is prolonged rain activity. The current spells have no connection to Cyclone Tej as it is far away in the east-central Arabian Sea.” On the question of the worsening air quality, Bhagwan Kesbhat, CEO of Waatavaran Foundation said that the civic body needs to take serious interventions to combat the issue. “Construction and other demolition works generate PM 10 in the air which causes major breathing issues amongst people, especially children and the elderly. Following the withdrawal of monsoon, the moisture levels remain high while temperatures dip in the night, the dust particles cannot be suppressed and remain suspended in the air. The BMC needs to come with serious, long term solutions unlike the smog guns which only settles down the dust temporarily,” said Kesbhat"

That ersatz … [+10938 chars]",Panama,"A rendering of a Crowley/BWXT nuclear ""power ship"" at work Almost a hundred years ago, the United States was the first country to use a ship to project electrical power ashore. That ersatz engineering effort helped a U.S. coastal community survive a crushing drought, and fueled development of an entirely new maritime platform. Today, as small modular nuclear reactors move from prototypes to reality, America stands, once again, on the threshold of a similar maritime power revolution, leveraging mobile sea “power” to help aid communities ashore. Many out there look to the U.S. Navy to move things along. But the Navy, while it leads the world in employing small nuclear reactors, makes an imperfect partner for today’s innovative ship-to-shore power platforms. The Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency—a department familiar with managing both nuclear risk and disaster recovery—is a far better choice to refresh America’s long-forgotten legacy of projecting power—electrical power—from the sea to shore. It will take funding and aggressive White House leadership to implement, but a FEMA fleet of nuclear-powered power generation vessels, built to bolster damaged or hurting electrical grids, can solve several pressing national issues. First, it can push civil development of nuclear power into the maritime. As a civilian, government-managed enterprise, a FEMA-managed disaster-response power-projection fleet can quickly bring new, clean, no-emission modular nuclear power plant designs to point where they are commercially viable. Second, by moving stewardship of this modern technology from the military sector to the civilian world, a FEMA disaster-response fleet gives the Department of Defense a much-needed civilian partner to help socialize the new technologies at sea. A civilian buffer between the Navy’s insular and secretive nuclear navy reduces risk of information loss while enabling wider and deeper public engagement. A FEMA power-generation fleet helps the military in other ways too. With a civilian assistance fleet, the military can avoid entanglement in unwanted portions the National disaster-response mission set. And yet, the military also gains a partner in helping to stabilize America’s strategically important territories and, potentially, some friendly island democracies. With DHS DHS already managing the U.S. Coast Guard, DHS administrators can follow a similar organizational template, aligning the civilian fleet for easy transfer to the Defense Department and preparing the oft-overlooked DHS shipyard in Baltimore for nuclear maintenance work. America needs this asset. Today, power is a more vital community lifeline than ever. In areas of instability, where disasters and conflict are now supercharged by powerful storms and abrupt climactic shifts, everything from basic economic development to disaster recovery is impossible without reliable and ready access to power. With several designs for new nuclear-powered electrical generation ships already on offer, a disaster-response fleet of reactor-equipped power generation vessels and barges makes sense. A disaster response fleet is a good way to justify operational evaluation of the various technical options out there. On a strategic level, the use case is simple. America’s island holdings and remote border states are more strategically important than ever. Beset by tropical storms, high energy prices and almost no political power in Washington, these isolated forward territories have struggled to maintain solid electrical generation infrastructure. Mobile power-generation platforms can do a lot to help when island power grids start coming apart. Put bluntly, power projection ashore is a critical unmet need in America’s geopolitical toolbox. America still hasn’t learned a lesson from twenty years ago. In 2003, America’s inability to quickly reconstitute the grid in Iraq’s urban areas was directly attributable to the emergence of civil unrest and resistance. Failure to reconstitute power—be it in hurricane-struck New Orleans, a beleaguered missile-hit Kyiv, or in the streets of Apra, Guam, power generation is the coin of credibility for modern societies and governments. As aid and assistance, electrical power is one of the most high-yield investments any country can make. The newly-constructed USS Lexington was one of the first maritime platforms to project electrical ... [+] power ashore America Has A Legacy Of Projecting Power Ashore After Emergencies: The Administration may struggle to justify the investment this new, low-emission technology. Efforts to grapple with extreme weather and rapid climate shifts is controversial fare for Congress, but America’s century-long record of using power ships and barges to address climate challenges is undeniable. The only problem is that nobody in Washington knows industrial history. America’s long and proud record of employing safe, maritime power generation is largely forgotten, and the industry itself is ignored. America has a strong record of success in afloat power generation. In 1929, after a severe drought cut hydroelectric generation sources in the Pacific Northwest, one of America’s first aircraft carriers, the USS Lexington (CV-2), powered the city of Tacoma for a month. For the Tacoma area, that electricity prevented economic disaster. It helped America’s national security too, by keeping the lights on at what today is now Joint Base Lewis-McChord. The world’s first power generation barge, the converted merchant ship SS Jacona, was converted in 1930, after a winter storm destroyed major transmission lines in the northeast. After supporting power generation needs in northern New England, it supplied power to Hawaii, South Korea and Okinawa before being sold in 1971. The world’s first floating nuclear power plant, the MH-1A Sturgis (formerly the Liberty-class cargo ship SS Charles H. Cugle), generated power in Panama from 1968 to 1976, helping the Canal Zone weather a drought that limited access to hydroelectric power. With the Suez Canal closed, and the Vietnam conflict raging, the Panama Canal was breaking traffic records and needed the extra electricity to keep the locks operating. The Navy’s legacy fleet of about 14 floating power barges—a grab bag of designs ranging from purpose-built barges to converted tankers, converted cargo ships, or even dry dock sections hosting an array of different types of generators—have faded from memory. Only a few people realize U.S. power barges were prototype platforms testing all kinds of operational scenarios. America’s power barges and power ships have been used to power everything from tropical islands to Distant Early Warning radars out at Thule, Greenland, near the Arctic Circle. In World War II, alone, seven destroyer escorts were converted to serve as floating power-ships/power barges. Up until the seventies and eighties, America used World War II-era power barges and power ships to power war-hit cities, keep critical ports open, radar sites operational and even to dredge strategic anchorages and fleet concentration areas. With a high-profile fleet of FEMA power-generation ships, the U.S. can recover this lost chapter of America’s industrial legacy. By gaining operational time and experience with modular reactor designs, the U.S. government can use a wide-ranging FEMA fleet to refine modern operational and regulatory expectations. A perfect application for America’s romantic pragmatism, this new disaster response fleet can set the groundwork for wider maritime exploitation of clean, safe modular nuclear reactors. A conventional power barge arrives in Cuba. If America does not act, China, Turkey or some other ... [+] fast-moving country will fill the vacuum. The Business Case For An American Nuclear “Power Projection” Fleet: A true “power projection” fleet makes sense, particularly for America’s strategically-important forward territories. In Puerto Rico alone, FEMA, after a series of storms and earthquakes, has obligated more than $9.4 billion to keep the island’s battered electrical system operational. At that level of investment, America could have fielded several powerships—platforms that would be available today for activities beyond just supporting Puerto Rico. Mobile “power-projection” support at sea is needed. Today, the strategic islands of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are America’s front-line communities. But they are in typhoon country too. It’s simply inappropriate and strategically silly to let these power grids struggle after a disaster or wallow in management challenges. The island grids break often. In 2015, Typhoon Soudelor compromised Saipan’s 104-megawatt power grid. In 2018, two super typhoons ripped through Saipan, Tinian and Rota, disrupting power on those islands for months. Right now, Guam is still trying to recover from a 2015 explosion and fire at their main Cabras power plant. It is simply unacceptable that, today, Guam faces regular rotating blackouts. But the list of power generation problems facing Guam is enormous. Critical base-load combustion turbines require a hot exchange and repair in the Continental United States. The generation facility to replace the broken Cabras generation complex is behind schedule, with typhoon damage pushing that start back almost two years—to the end of 2025. Procurement protests have shaved production from other important generators by 75%. The situation is critical. Right now, Guam has 234 megawatts of generation capacity while Guam’s peak demand is in the vicinity of 220 megawatts. Certainly, conventional floating power plants can provide the same support. But, unlike nuclear power generators, they can’t do it alone. Conventional power plants need fuel, and that means added infrastructure, a fuel supply, and potentially more ships to carry fuel oil, diesel, gas, biofuel, or some type of natural gas, or maybe, in the future, methanol, ammonia or hydrogen. For a disaster-hit site, thousands of miles from anywhere, the logistical cost adds up. Fuel surcharges—particularly for remote regions—can boost retail energy prices by 400-500 percent. In an emergency, those costs are even higher. Floating nuclear power plants make political sense. The Secretary of the Navy, Carlos Del Toro, is proposing something a lot of us have been urging for a long time—a “new maritime statecraft,” integrating the various aspects of America’s maritime power into a cohesive, unified whole. It’s time for the Administration to put its money where its mouth is. This call to introduce a new agency into America’s wider maritime family, using it as an opportunity to both revitalize America’s waterfront as well as to help jump-start America’s nascent nuclear industry—while bolstering the islands and towns on the front lines of an increasingly contested maritime—is an easy win. And if we don’t move on it, right now, China, where researchers are busy producing engineering papers exploring the technical challenges of restarting dead electrical grids on islands, will."

More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm. Some children, like 10-year-old Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim, are already on the move. Her family left their home in Somalia after dawn prayers on a Saturday morning five months ago. The worst drought in more than 50 years scorched the once-fertile pastures the family relied on, leaving them barren. So, bundling only a few clothes and some utensils into sacks, they moved to a camp in the capital Mogadishu, where Ibrahim, who dreams of being a doctor, is now going to school for the first time. That’s a plus, but the camp lacks proper shelter and sanitation, and food is scarce. “We need something that can protect us from the heat during the day and the cold at night,” Ibrahim said. Read more:U.N. Climate Warning Also Comes With Clear Steps To Cut Emissions The miseries of long, drawn-out disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report — more than half of them in Somalia — but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no pre-emptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide,climate changehas already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines; storms are battering megacities and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. “The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in (the) future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify,” said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the report's authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 2016-21 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. Floods displaced children more than 19 million times in places like India and China. Wildfires impacted children 810,000 times in the U.S. and Canada. Data tracking migrations because of weather extremes typically don't differentiate between children and adults. UNICEF worked with a Geneva-based nonprofit, the International Displacement Monitoring Center, to map where kids were most impacted. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. Those countries also have vast populations and strong systems to evacuate people, which makes it easier for them to record data. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring “overlapping crises” — where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. During unprecedented flooding of the Yamuna River in July in the Indian capital New Delhi, churning waters washed away the hut that was home to 10-year-old Garima Kumar’s family. The waters also took her school uniform and her school books. Kumar lived with her family on sidewalks of the megacity and missed a month of school. “Other students in the school teased me because my house had been flooded. Because we don’t have a permanent home,” Kumar said. The floodwaters have receded and the family began repairing their home last month — a process Garima’s mother Meera Devi said they are having to do over and over again as floods are becoming more common. Her father, Shiv Kumar, hasn’t had any work for over a month. The family's only income is the mother’s $2 daily earnings as a domestic helper. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnam-based expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasn’t involved with the report. “When you’re desperate, you do things that you normally wouldn’t do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they don’t have the ability to stand up for themselves,” she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become “shock-responsive, portable and inclusive,” to help children and their families better cope with disasters. This would mean considering children’s needs at different stages, from ensuring they have opportunities to study, that they can stay with their families and that eventually they can find work. “We have the tools. We have the knowledge. But we’re just not working fast enough,” Healy said."

Hong Kong has closed schools and suspended trading on the stock exchange after a weakening Typhoon Koinu brought torrential rain and storm-force winds to the southern Chinese territory. More than 150mm of rain was recorded over most parts of Hong Kong from midnight into Monday morning, with rainfall exceeding 300mm in some areas, data showed. The Hong Kong Observatory issued a “black” rainstorm warning – its highest – for about six hours before it was downgraded at 10.30am (02:30 GMT), a month after the city was paralysed by theworst floods in 140 years. While Koinu, which killed one person in Taiwan last week, had weakened into a severe tropical storm, it still brought significant disruption. Schools and childcare centres were ordered to shut and the morning session at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was suspended. Trade was expected to resume at 2pm (06:00 GMT). Hundreds of passengers were stranded at Hong Kong’s airport overnight and underground metro stations as Koinu disrupted flights and transport, public broadcaster RTHK reported. In early September, Hong Kong was brought to a standstill by torrential rain that swamped streets andflooded shopping malls and metro stations. A “black” warning was also issued then. In China’s Guangdong province – where Koinu is expected to sweep past en route to Hainan island – the cities of Zhuhai and Jiangmen issued a Level III emergency response, according to the Xinhua news agency on Sunday. The alert meant more than 35,500 fishing boats had to return to port, while dozens of coastal scenic areas were temporarily closed. Southern China is frequently hit during the summer and autumn seasons by typhoons that form in the warm oceans east of the Philippines and then travel west. But climate change has made tropical storms more unpredictable while increasing their intensity – bringing more rain and stronger gusts that lead to flash floods and coastal damage, experts say.

More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released on Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm. The miseries of long, drawn-out disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report — more than half of them in Somalia — but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no pre-emptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide, climate change has already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines; storms are battering cities, and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. “The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in (the) future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify,” said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the report's authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 2016-21 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring “overlapping crises” — where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnam-based expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasn’t involved with the report. “When you’re desperate, you do things that you normally wouldn’t do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they don’t have the ability to stand up for themselves,” she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become “shock-responsive, portable and inclusive,” to help children and their families better cope with disasters. This would mean considering children’s needs at different stages, from ensuring they have opportunities to study, that they can stay with their families and that eventually they can find work. “We have the tools. We have the knowledge. But we’re just not working fast enough,” Healy said."

That works out to 20,000 children displaced every single day due to extreme weather fueled by climate change. The researchers found that floods and storms caused 95% of all child displacements recorded, with the rest due to drought and wildfires. “It is terrifying for any child when a ferocious wildfire, storm or flood barrels into their community,” said UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell, in a statement. Thereportis the first of its kind, according to UNICEF. “Until now, children displaced by weather-related events have been statistically invisible,” the organization said in a statement. East Asia and the Pacific have been particularly affected. In 2020,Cyclone Amphanled to 1.5 million child displacements across India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Bhutan. In 2021,Typhoon Raicaused 1.5 million child displacements across the Philippines, Palau and Vietnam. By overall numbers of displacements, three countries dominated: the Philippines, India and China, where a total of 23 million children were forced from their homes and schools across the six-year period. The location and geography of these countries make them prone to floods and storms, which are set to worsen as the climate crisis intensifies. However, the report noted that all three countries implement preemptive evacuation plans, meaning children can be moved before a disaster hits, which may account for the higher numbers of displacements. A different picture emerges when looking at the number of children displaced relative to the size of each country’s population. Storms in the small Caribbean island country of Dominica, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017, displaced 76% of the child population over the six-year period. South Sudan and Somalia experienced the highest proportion of child displacement from flooding, with 11% and 12% of children having to flee their homes, the report found. Both countries implement far fewer evacuation plans, making children even more vulnerable, according to the report. Meanwhile drought, particularly in Somalia, Ethiopia and Afghanistan has contributed to over 1.3 million children having to leave their homes. However these statistics are likely to be conservative, as there is less data available for slow-onset disasters like drought, the reported noted. Wildfires in the US and Canada have also led to child displacement, and they are likely to cause larger-scale displacements in the future, the report found. “For those who are forced to flee, the fear and impact can be especially devastating, with worry of whether they will return home, resume school, or be forced to move again. Moving may have saved their lives, but it’s also very disruptive,” UNICEF’s Russell said. Whether short-lived or long-term, displacement can amplify risks of exploitation, child trafficking and abuse, while also exposing children to malnutrition, disease and inadequate immunization, the report found. The situation is poised to get worse. As the human-caused climate crisis accelerates, extreme weather is becoming more severe and more common. With every additional 1 degree Celsius of warming, the global risks of displacement from flooding are projected to rise by 50%, according to research cited in the report. “We have the tools and knowledge to respond to this escalating challenge for children, but we are acting far too slowly,” Russell said."

By Subel Rai Bhandari for RFA 2023.10.06 -- More than 43 million children were internally displaced over six years due to climate change-exacerbated, weather-related disasters, with China, India and the Philippines leading the chart in absolute numbers, a U.N. agency said in a new report. ""While the link between climate change and displacement is complex, it's clearer than ever that the climate is shifting patterns of displacement,"" UNICEF said Friday in a statement, releasing the report, ""Children displaced in a changing climate."" Between 2016 and 2021, the U.N. Children's Fund said 43.1 million youngsters - or about 20,000 child displacements a day - across 44 countries were displaced in the most common weather-related hazards, including floods, storms, droughts and wildfires. Floods and storms drove 95% of recorded child displacements. It was unclear how many of the 43 million children were, in fact, preemptive evacuees, as opposed to displaced for the short or long term. ""It is terrifying for any child when a ferocious wildfire, storm or flood barrels into their community,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. ""For those who are forced to flee, the fear and impact can be especially devastating, with worry of whether they will return home, resume school, or be forced to move again. Moving may have saved their lives, but it's also very disruptive."" ""As the impacts of climate change escalate, so too will climate-driven movement."" The report said 9.7 million child displacements in the Philippines alone, 6.7 million in India, and 6.4 million in China were due to all four hazards combined. The numbers were high due to geographic locations, exposure to extreme weather, large child populations, and progress made on early warning and evacuation capacities. Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Vietnam came fourth, eighth, and ninth in the top-10 ranking based on absolute numbers, with 3.3 million, 960,000, and 930,000 children respectively displaced between 2016 and 2021. Relative to the size of their child population, Dominica (76%) experienced the largest number of child displacements from all four disasters. The list included Vanuatu, the Philippines, and Fiji. Between 2016 and 2021, floods displaced roughly 19.7 million children globally. India (3.9 million), China (3.7 million), and the Philippines (1.3 million) were hardest hit. Similarly, storms led to the displacement of about 21 million children, with the highest numbers in the Philippines (8.3 million), India (2.8 million) and China (2.6 million). Asia and the Pacific frequently experience storms, leading to mass evacuations. In 2020, Cyclone Amphan displaced 1.5 million children in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Bhutan, while Typhoon Rai (Odette) displaced 1.5 million children in the Philippines, Palau, and Vietnam in 2021. Droughts caused over 1.3 million child displacements in 15 countries, with 730,000 in Somalia, 340,000 in Ethiopia, and 190,000 in Afghanistan. Wildfires, which primarily affected the Americas, displaced 810,000 children between 2016 and 2021, with the United States, Canada, and Israel seeing the highest child displacements at 610,000, 47,000, and 31,000, respectively. Using a disaster displacement risk model, the UNICEF report predicted that riverine floods may displace an average of 3.2 million children annually, totaling 96 million over 30 years. Cyclonic winds follow, potentially displacing over 10.3 million children, while storm surges might account for 7.2 million displacements in the same three-decade span. ""Given their large population, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Philippines and China are the five countries with the most predicted future displacements of children owing to all hazards combined (riverine flood, cyclones and storm surges),"" the report said.

Yes, they're surrounded by oozing mud.But looks can be deceiving. These remarkable shrubs and trees are nurseries for many species of fish, shellfish and crabs. They protect our coastlines from erosion, storm surges, wind and floods. And that mud? It's one of the best biological ways we know of to store carbon.Theseecosystem servicesare extremely valuable—but people often don't notice what they offer until they're lost to aquaculture, firewood or settlement.Conservingmangrovesby declaring parks and other protected areas seems like a logical solution. But often, nations can see protected areas as a cost, walling them off from human use, and ignoring their benefits to people.What ournew research showsis that you don't have to choose between nature and humans. Protecting mangroves offers a win-win, given how valuable they are to coastal communities, fishers and the fight against climate change.As nations aim to conserve 30% of their lands and waters by decade's end, those lucky enough to have mangroves should look to their coasts.Why are mangroves so important?Mangroves thrive on the coast, poised between land and sea. They first evolved between 100 million and 65 million years ago. Each of the 65 species of mangrove is a shrub or tree which has, over time, evolved to live in salt or brackish water.These trees are extremely resilient, surviving in brackish water and low-oxygen conditions, which would kill other trees. To survive, they've acquired adaptations such as aerial roots that can take in oxygen. These tangled roots make excellent hiding places for the creatures of land and sea, including mudskipper fish able to survive out of water.Aerial roots let these trees and shrubs exchange gases with the atmosphere when the soil is waterlogged. Credit: Alvise DabalàTheir complex roots are ideal nurseries for juvenile fish, crabs and prawns by providing shelter and places to feed. In turn, these nurseries keep populations healthy, sustaining commercial fisheries as well as direct sources of protein for coastal people.Their robust tangles of roots protect them from the force of waves, storm surges and wind. In turn, this helps people, who can shelter behind this green wall, protecting our homes.Mangroves also act as a natural way to tackle climate change. Their roots trap sediment, burying inorganic and organic carbon in the process. They also store carbon in their biomass. Overall, these sea forestsstore carbonat almost three times the rate of tropical rainforests, twice that of peat swamps, and almost seven times the rate of seagrasses.Protecting mangroves needs a different approachWhile mangroves give us a host of benefits, many of these only become apparent when these ecosystems are gone.Unfortunately, mangroves are often cleared to make way for aquaculture, farming and human settlements, or for firewood. An estimated 20–35% of the world's mangroveshave been lost since 1980. In better news, losses have declined significantly. We now lose around0.13% per year.Protected areas work well as a way to cut mangrove losses. When a government sets out to create these areas, the aim is usually to protect biodiversity while minimizing conflict with human use.In our research, we found the world's network of protected areas isn't doing a great job in protecting either mangrove biodiversity or the ecosystem benefits mangroves give us. In fact, it's no better than just picking areas at random.That means high-priority mangrove forests important for both biodiversity and ecosystem services are not being properly conserved. Clever expansion of the current network could solve the problem. At present, parks and other protected areas cover about 13% of the world's mangrove forests, which are clustered around the tropics.Mangrove forest in Karimunjawa, Indonesia. Credit: Alvise DabalàBoosting this to 30%—in line with the biodiversity conservation target agreed to by196 nations last year—would reap benefits. Our research suggests it would safeguard houses and infrastructure worth A$25.6 billion, protect six million people against coastal flooding, and store over one billion extra tons of carbon. Also, fishers would gain an extra 50 million days of successful fishing a year.Even better—we found optimizing conservation of both biodiversity and ecosystem services needed only 3–9% more area protected compared to mangrove protection areas based on saving species alone.Protect mangroves in Asia and OceaniaMangrove forests urgently needing protection are almost all in Asia (63% of the total) and Oceania (17%), where we find large biodiverse mangrove forests which support fishing industries and many coastal communities.Indonesia is a particular hotspot, given its 17,000-odd islands are often ringed by mangroves. Mangroves in India, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea also need better protection.Australia does reasonably well. Around 18% of our mangroves are protected, above the global average of 13.5%. Over 20% of the areas we have flagged are high-priority for mangrove conservation are already protected. Even so, expanding the protected area network would be a good move, as Australian mangroves are some of the world's most biodiverse and carbon-rich.Mangroves in parts of northern Queensland need better protection. Some mangroves are already protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Reserve, but there are still large unprotected tracts.Mangroves around Darwin and Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory need expanded protected areas, as do those on the coast between the Pilbara and the Kimberley in Western Australia.Too often, protecting nature is seen as a cost to society. What our modeling shows is that we can have a win-win. By protecting the most precious areas ofmangrove, we can protect human communities and wider biodiversity at a stroke."

Garner looked at all storms over different time periods and found that in general they're intensifying faster than they used to.There have been more Atlantic storms in the last few decades than in the 1970s and 1980s—scientists have several theories for why, from changes in air pollution to natural cycles—but Garner said by looking at percentages she took out the storm frequency factor.Previous studies had found an increase in rapid intensification.

Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston on Sept. 20.Chloe Veltman/NPRhide caption Conservation professionals learn how to respond to cultural heritage emergencies following disasters at the John F. 20. La Casa del Libro Museum Libraryin San Juan was among the many cultural institutions to suffer devastating consequences after hurricanes Irma and Maria walloped Puerto Rico in 2017. Human-driven climate change was the engine behind both. Strong winds caused the museum's power to go out. This meant no air conditioning. And the high humidity levels threatened the museum's world-class collection of 15th century books and artworks with mold. About a month after disaster struck, the institution put out a call to theNational Heritage Responders Hotlinefor help. The National Heritage Responders is a volunteer network of around 100 experts in cultural heritage conservation from around the country. They assist individuals and institutions in figuring out how to save important objects and buildings after disasters. Individuals, if your personal items have been damaged in an emergency, email:NHRpublichelpline@culturalheritage.org Institutions, if your collections have been affected by an emergency, call: 202-661-8068, or, if it's not urgent emailemergencies@culturalheritage.org Their crisis hotline has been busier than ever in recent years because of more frequent and severe weather brought on by climate change. In 2023, there have been around 70 calls so far, up from fewer than 10 in 2008, when the hotline first appeared. (The hotline is intended for the use of cultural institutions; individual members of the public can get in touch with the network viaemail.) ""Climate change is increasing the frequency and the severity of the disasters that we're experiencing,"" said Ann Frellsen. The Atlanta-based book and paper conservator is a longtime heritage responder volunteer with more than three decades of experience helping out cultural institutions after disasters. She was among those deployed to Puerto Rico over several visits starting a couple of months after the hurricanes hit. ""It's just a constant battle."" After providing initial support via the phone, Frellsen and her team came in to help La Casa del Libro and other local institutions in crisis with equipment, supplies and advice. (Much of the advice the hotline provides is via phone or video-chat; volunteers are sent out into the field in certain cases, on an as-needed basis.) In this photo taken Jan. 1, 2018, National Heritage Responders assist at La Casa Del Libro in San Juan, Puerto Rico in the aftermath of hurricanes Irma and Maria. Ann Frellsen is pictured in the black shirt.Karen Cana-Cruzhide caption In this photo taken Jan. Ann Frellsen is pictured in the black shirt. ""There were no stoplights and there were no signs on the highways, because they'd all blown away,"" Frellsen said. Frellsen said figuring out how to reach the more than 20 institutions that needed assistance in Puerto Rico was challenging — and that's to say nothing of theon-the-job hazards. ""As hot and humid as it was, we were in full Tyvek suits the entire time because the mold situation was just unfathomable,"" Frellsen said. ""We don't have a conservator in-house. We weren't prepared,"" said La Casa del Libro's executive director, Karen Cana-Cruz. ""So the assistance of the National Heritage Responders for us was very important, very appreciated."" When she isn't heading into disaster zones to help salvage artifacts and heirlooms from fires, hurricanes and floods, Frellsen trains others in the heritage conservation field to do the same. Recently, she co-led a workshop of professional librarians, archivists and conservators at theJohn F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museumin Boston. Some of the participants may eventually take the test to become National Heritage Responders. But at this moment, they were deep in a hands-on training exercise, based on an imaginary scenario cooked up by Frellsen and her co-trainers. Disaster response training participant Evan Knight peers into a display case containing a ballgown worn by Rosemary Kennedy in 1938.Chloe Veltman/NPRhide caption Disaster response training participant Evan Knight peers into a display case containing a ballgown worn by Rosemary Kennedy in 1938. In the scenario, a blizzard had triggered the museum's sprinkler system — which can happen in strong winds — and all that water has left behind soggy carpets, excess humidity, and many precious presidential artifacts in a World War II exhibition in peril. Huddled around a tall glass case containing a ball-gown worn by John F. Kennedy's sister, Rosemary Kennedy, in 1938, the trainee heritage responders tried to figure out how to protect the gauzy, peach-colored dress — and the other treasures on display — from the ravages of mold. ""I would mitigate the high humidity in the space,"" said Evan Knight, the preservation specialist with Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners, the state agency that supports libraries in Massachusetts. ""And if we deal with the humidity, then that should help at least arrest mold growth to some extent before a conservator can come in."" But Annie Rubel, a historic preservation expert in Deerfield, Mass., wasn't too keen on this idea. ""Well, I think that this is an extremely fragile piece,"" Rubel countered. ""If there is no textile conservator on the way immediately, I would fashion some kind of support sling and very gently remove it from the area."" Ultimately, they decide to remove the carpet from under the case and stabilize the environment in the case itself. The National Heritage Responders was launched by theFoundation for Advancement in Conservationin 2006. But it was in the 1940s that the United States and Europe first started thinking seriously about how to recover culturally important artifacts and sites after a crisis. World War II compelled countries to band together to protect cultural treasures, forming a group of 345 men and women from 13 countries known asThe Monuments Men. Since then, efforts around saving cultural heritage after disasters have evolved beyond historic buildings and celebrated works of art. For example, after floods devastated Eastern Kentucky in 2022, National Heritage Responders helped salvage thousands of reel-to-reel tapes documenting Appalachian cultural traditions. They also recently ran online workshops on disaster recovery for people in Maui following this summer's wildfires. ""A community can't recover if they lose those cultural identities,"" said Frellsen, ""and their cultural identity is often tied up in the objects and the spaces that they live with."" Frellsen said she's excited about the next generation that she's training — especially with human-caused climate change creating a lot more work. ""It's really comforting to know that there are a lot more people who can come in and replace us, with a lot more stamina and energy than I find I have,"" she said. ""I would really love to be deployed,"" said Rubel, the preservation expert who attended the training in Boston. Rubel said she hopes her background in building conservation will secure her a spot in the National Heritage Responders' network. ""That's an underrepresented skillset on the team,"" Rubel said. ""So I'm hoping that that comes up sooner rather than later."" Audio and digital story edited byJennifer Vanasco. Audio produced byIsabella Gomez Sarmiento. Loading..."

American cities are const… [+12570 chars]",Real estate,"American cities are constantly in competition — for people, professional sports teams, headline-grabbing events, and company headquarters. For decades, cities have duked it out for titles like ""best city for business"" or ""healthiest city in America,"" but now they're starting to compete for a new title: best place to ride out dystopia. Every American city has its charms and its flaws. Some boast of great barbecue, while others tout their proximity to sandy beaches. The country's vast size gives American families and businesses a large menu of climates, real-estate markets, andamenities from which to choose. It also forces elected officials to employ a variety of tactics such ascash incentives, infrastructure investments, and tax breaks to win over prospective transplants and fortify their economies. Whether it's Los Angeles scoring the 2028 Olympics, or Austin persuading Tesla to move its headquarters to the city, splashy announcements generate buzz about the winning cities and allow them to sell people on the upside of moving to the area. On the flip side, cities that lose people and jobs are at risk of entering the ""urban doom loop"" — a downward spiral ofdeclining economic vitality, falling tax revenue, and a drop in local public services. Over the past 50 years, the winners of this intercity battle have been the booming metros in theSun Belt. Millions of people have migrated to the US South and West seeking out the sun and cheaper homes. Business has followed: Theheadquarters of Fortune 500 companieshave rapidly shifted away from industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast toward cities like Dallas, Houston, and Atlanta. However, in recent years these onetime winners have started to grapple with a new set of challenges caused by the changing climate:120-degree days in the summer, encroaching flood waters, and the ever present threat of wildfires. The idyllic destinations for Americans seeking a better life are starting to look like precarious long-term bets. While Sun Belt cities are working to mitigate these challenges, the increased risks also create an opportunity for once forgotten cities. Places that previously were in decline such as Buffalo, New York, and Detroit are rolling out a new type of marketing campaign to make the case that they can offer a desirable mix of stable weather, cheap housing, and robust public investment. These ""climate oases"" and ""climate havens"" have been trying to attract newly footloose Americans, freed from the office by the rise of working from home, and lure risk-averse people who are deeply concerned about rising climate risk. While many Americans are still moving into areas facing arising tide of disasters, the country's increasing climate risks have sparked a countermovement of people looking for a safe haven from storms and droughts. A report from the real-estate-data provider CoreLogic found that14.5 million homes in the USwere affected by natural disasters in 2021, and according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the number of disasters causing more than $1 billion in damage has been increasing over the past 10 years. The frequency of these costly catastrophes is making many Americans rethink their living arrangements: 23% of people surveyed ina recent USA Today pollsaid they thought they would eventually be forced to move because of the climate crisis. For Americans living in areas more prone to disasters, the numbers were even higher — 30% of people in the West said they anticipated needing to move eventually. Most of the current climate migration is happening in outlying areas faced with recurring natural disasters. Longtime residents of theFlorida Keys, which have been battered by fierce hurricanes and rising sea levels, are starting to leave their homes. And many residents of rural California are finding it increasingly difficult to purchasehome insurancein fire-prone areas, prompting some to move. But as weather extremes become more pronounced, major metro areas could start to feel some strain. A 2016 study published in the Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists,found that""Americans favor a daily average temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit"" and would generally pay more to avoid excessive heat rather than cold. So as average temperatures start to drift higher around the country, some of the more populated areas in theSouth and West could begin to lose outas people seekrelief from the heat. This opens the door for once beleaguered locales in the Midwest and industrial Northeast to reenter the ring. For decades, cities such as Detroit, Baltimore, and Cincinnati have been on a downward spiral as they lose people and businesses to the sunnier parts of the country. But now the tides are starting to turn in their favor: These cities generally have easy access to plenty of clean water, cooler climates, and less exposure to the coastal hurricanes, forest fires, and flooding that are more frequent in the Sun Belt. Add in relatively cheap homes and a willingness to invest in the types of infrastructure necessary to adapt to our changing planet, and the formerly forgotten parts of the country are starting to look attractive. Take Buffalo. The city's population has since 1970 been on a long, steady decline as its thriving industrial sector was hollowed out. Now, the city's leaders have sensed an opportunity to revitalize the region. Buffalo's natural characteristics provide a good starting point — its high temperature in July of 79 degrees is much cooler than in Phoenix, for instance. And according to data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the city has been hit by only 27 federally declared disasters since 1953. Compare that with the 80 disasters that have hit Los Angeles County and the 41 disasters in Miami-Dade County. Then there's its abundant freshwater from Lake Erie, relatively cheap housing market — Zillowshows that the median home pricein the city was $215,000 as of October — and robust infrastructure from the city's previous life as a manufacturing center. With all that in mind, Buffalo has a chance to stage a serious comeback. Buffalo's leaders have decided to capitalize on these advantages by explicitly painting the city as a safe spot to ride out the county's coming climate upheaval. In a 2019 speech, Mayor Byron Brown said the city would be a ""climate refuge"" for Americans seeking a more stable place to lay down roots and promised to make investments in the city's resiliency. The declaration has been followed up with investments in key areas — climate resilience was one of the four pillars that made up the city's four-year strategic plan released at the start of 2023. As part of the plan, Buffalo's government said it planned to invest in a more resilient localelectricity grid, convert city vehicles and buildings to renewable energy, and invest in emissions-reducing infrastructure such as electric-vehicle charging stations and improved bike lanes. Beyond direct investment, the city also committed to working with private businesses to reduce their climate impact, including financing that allows companies to make energy-efficient upgrades to their facilities on the cheap. While there are many questions about the rollout of the plans, the vocal commitment of Buffalo to make the changes needed to make the city more climate-resilient will likely act as a clarion call for many Americans. Each year, roughly 8 million Americans move to a different state. If 1% of these movers chose Buffalo, this would be an inflow of 80,000 people to a city home to 275,000 people — a massive increase. And Buffalo isn't the only city in the country's industrial belt trying to win over new residents with this sales pitch: Places includingDuluth, Minnesota;Grand Rapids, Michigan; and evenChicagoare also making a bid for free-moving and climate-concerned workers. Climate competition is still just one aspect of the battle between cities. Other factors, such as schools, crime, and job availability, are also crucial to developing the image as an up-and-coming place to move. Many of the cities that are trying to offer themselves to ""climate refugees"" have struggled with one or more of these elements in the recent past — but there is hope here. Households and individuals are able to make an informed decision about where to live based on a wealth of data, on things including home prices, graduation rates for public schools, and job openings. For concerns such as crime, theFBI has a tool on its websiteto allow people to compare data for different cities and states across the country. As we start to learn more about the emerging climate risks to various parts of the country, the US government can play a similar role in providing city-level data including recent temperature by month, air pollution, natural-disaster damage, and rainfall. The real-estate firmRedfinhas partnered with the nonprofit First Street Foundation to provide property-level report cards on fire, flood, and heat risk to people searching for housing. My ongoing research highlights that homebuyers in both red states and blue states have begun to make decisions based on this information, weighing it as a factor in where they choose to move. As extreme weather events occur, people looking for a new home will be able to evaluate how many people died or lost their homes in any given city because of the climate crisis. The most climate-resilient cities will become the clear winners. And if cities such as Buffalo and Detroit invested in infrastructure — from new roads and renewable-power plants to entertainment districts and improved schools — to support movers, this would act as a self-reinforcing economic cycle that could enhance their natural weather advantages. As the population grows, new restaurants and cultural opportunities will pop up. Home prices will grow, creating local wealth and economic development. And the spending on activities and housing will boost local tax revenues and provide cities a chance to reinvest in core services — the opposite of the ""doom loop."" But public-sector investment alone won't go very far without the innovation of the private sector. Northern and Midwestern states will need a strong private-sector presence to meet the ever evolving demands that the climate crisis and a wave of new residents will bring. Here, too, there are hopeful examples. In the recent past, the city of Pittsburgh suffered a sharp decline when its ""golden goose"" of steel production declined. In recent decades,the city has made a dramatic comebackas a ""brains economy"" featuring robotics firms working with researchers at nearby universities and the rise of the health-innovation economy. After decades of decline, census estimates show that the Pittsburgh area's population finally leveled off from 2010 to 2022 and suggest that the number of people living in the citycould bounce back in the coming years. Pittsburgh's rebound offers an optimistic case study for other Rust Belt cities. The shifting climate does not mean that there will be a sudden migration of Americans to the middle of the country. Many people still stick close to home: A 2015 report from The New York Times found that the averageAmerican lived only 18 miles from their mother. And the cities that could become climate havens have their weather downsides — Buffalo will still have some harsh winters, too. But even in small numbers, regional migration will have serious downstream effects on America's cities. If Buffalo, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and other cities succeed in their climate-resilience agendas, they will grow, attracting residents from more at-risk areas of the country. That, in turn, will force at-risk cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Phoenix to invest more to offset their heat and flood risk. Even on a city level, competition fosters innovation — and the great ""Super Bowl"" of climate competition will spur our collective adaptation. Matthew E.

The Met Office issued a yellow warning for wind and rain along the south coast of England. More than 300 schools are shut across the region, while major incidents have been declared in Hampshire, the Isle of Wight and Jersey. Dozens of people in Jersey were evacuated to hotels overnight as wind gusts of up to 102mph uprooted trees and damaged homes. The Grand Hotel in St Helier was damaged, with the side rendering ripped away after winds tore through the island in the early hours of the morning. The storm is causing severe disruption in the south of England with strong winds and rain affecting many transport routes. The Environment Agency says flooding is expected in 82 areas, most of which are on the south coast. The Port of Dover suspended all sailings earlier, sparking long lorry queues - it has since reopened for shipping, but passenger ferries are cancelled. Coastal regions of north-west France have been battered by gale-force winds of 128mph (207km/h), as Storm Ciarán reached Brittany and Normandy. Power provider Enedis says 1.2 million people are without electricity, after falling trees brought down power lines and pylons. Some of the worst damage has been reported in Finistère, in the far north-west, where gusts of 128mph were recorded at Pointe-du-Raz. The local prefect has barred all traffic from the roads apart from emergency services and other essential transport. Warnings were activated throughout Spain, except for the Canary Islands, because of heavy rain, gusts of wind of up to 68mph, with a greater incidence in the Galicia region, which is on the red alert.

There is widespread flooding and damage around the UK, with thousands of homes left without power, hundreds of schools closed and major travel disruption. Southern England and the Channel Islands have been worst-hit by Ciarán, with 80 flood warnings still in place across England. No UK deaths have so far been linked to the rain and 100mph (161km/h) gusts. But countless homes around the country have been severely damaged - with some residents even believing they have been hit by tornadoes - and many still assessing the full scale of the destruction. It follows a series of other flooding incidents in recent weeks. One yellow weather warning for rain remains in place until Friday evening in eastern Scotland, with the rest of the country no longer covered by any other weather warnings. More than 200 flood alerts have been issued for England, alongside the 86 flood warnings where flooding is expected, but there are currently no severe flood warnings - the highest category - in place. Dozens of people in Jersey were evacuated to hotels overnight on Wednesday after gusts of up to 102mph (164km/h) were recorded. Locals were also hit by huge hailstones ""bigger than golf balls"". In St Clement, Sharon Mackie Marquer filmed video showing the destruction around her home, with roof tiles littering her garden and the fence knocked over. Cars smashed up by debris and overturned tables can also be seen. A clip from the same Jersey parish showed Jessica O'Reilly sleeping in bed alongside her baby when the sound of the 'weather bomb' woke her - seconds before the window was blown inwards. She described the moment her ""motherly instinct"" kicked in, telling the BBC: ""We went up to bed and could hear the wind getting stronger and stronger, closer and closer. ""Something didn't seem right, then the windows just smashed in, I grabbed [my daughter] and got out the room. ""I think I just thought 'my baby's in danger, I need to get out' and ran down the stairs."" She added that her house is not habitable as there is still glass everywhere, and they are having to stay in a hotel - but despite the shock, there was ""not a scratch"" on mother or baby. St Helier-based Carl Walker, the chairman of Jersey's Consumer Council, said his family were woken by hailstones at midnight, which he said had stuck together to create ""golf ball-sized lumps of ice"". He explained: ""We camped out in our living room downstairs with our children because it was just simply too noisy and too frightening to be upstairs in the bedrooms - tiles were lifting, debris was hitting the roof, windows were flexing. ""The noise of the wind was just incredible and quite frightening. It was like a scene from a disaster movie."" Mags Balston, who is in her 80s and has lived in her house in Jersey for 21 years, told the BBC that she is still in shock after spending the night in her kitchen after the windows blew in. She recalls ""a sudden explosion like a bomb had gone off"" but wants to stay in her home as she does not want to move the cat. Elsewhere across the British Isles, roofs have been blown off, some train lines have completely ground to a halt and there were long queues around the Port of Dover, which shut earlier amid rough seas. Some train companies had asked commuters to work from home ahead of major disruption to lines in southern England and Scotland. South Western Railway was among the rail providers impacted and said services across the whole network may be cancelled, delayed or revised - with disruptions expected until the end of Thursday. The storm caused chaos for drivers too, and the AA, which had a large number of callouts in southern England, said it had rescued 84 customers stuck in floods so far on Thursday. One driver caught in flood water was being treated for hypothermia, it added. There was also significant disruption at airports, with all flights from Jersey, Guernsey and Alderney cancelled on Thursday. In Northern Ireland, which is experiencing flooding following heavy rain and weather warnings earlier this week, one assembly member branded the scenes in County Down ""apocalyptic"", with flood waters ""decimating"" local businesses. In France, where 1.2 million people were reported to be without electricity, a lorry driver was killed after being struck by a falling tree. Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands have also been badly hit. Around 9,000 homes across Devon and Cornwall, Sussex, Surrey and the Channel Islands were left without power earlier today. Emergency services said earlier an unoccupied vehicle which washed off a promenade in Devon on Wednesday night will remain on a beach until it is safe to recover it. In Falmouth, student Kate Marsh told the BBC she was woken at 05:30 GMT when the roof of her bedroom entirely blew off and collapsed onto her. Aaron Waterer had a similar experience in his motorhome in Broadstairs, Kent. A large tree branch was ripped off in strong winds and pierced the roof - ending up just centimetres above his mattress. But 47-year-old Mr Waterer was out of bed getting a drink of water at the time of the incident, around 02:00 GMT. ""My nerves were all shot"", he said. ""I just didn't know what to do, it was just shock. I still don't think it has sunk in that much, it's just bizarre."" In south Wales, a caravan park was evacuated following a risk to life warning, with ""the majority"" of the Kiln Park site underwater. One man was pictured kayaking through the area. In Dorset, firefighters evacuated 70 people from 198 caravans at Freshwater Holiday Park in Burton Bradstock, near Bridport, with some being taken to dry land by boat. Many children remained at home across the country, as more than 300 schools closed in southern England, mainly in Devon. Albourne School in Hassocks, West Sussex, closed after it was struck by lightning, lost power and was flooded. The Government of Jersey said schools will close for a second day on Friday, as they aim to get pupils back in classrooms on Monday. Elizabeth Rizzini, from BBC Weather, said many coastal areas had been exposed to dangerously large waves. ""The wind gusts have now peaked... winds will ease as we head through the rest of (Thursday) as the storm pulls out into the North Sea"", she explained. But Ms Rizzini warned some gusts of 60-65mph (97-105km/h) could still be expected along the coast, particularly in eastern areas. She added: ""We are going to see more heavy rain, another 40 to 60mm perhaps over the higher ground of the Pennines."" Strong winds and rain are expected overnight in north-east England and northern Scotland, but Friday is forecast to be calmer. Storm Ciarán is the third named storm of the year, after Babet caused significant flooding to thousands of homes a fortnight ago, and Agnes struck in late September. BBC Weather's Matt Taylor confirmed that Ciarán has been classified as a weather bomb, or 'explosive cyclogenesis'. He explained that meteorologists use the term for a storm ""that appears to intensify rapidly, with its central air pressure dropping by at least 24 millibars (mb) in 24 hours."" Experts say a warming atmosphere increases the chance of intense rainfall and storms. However, many factors contribute to extreme weather and it takes time for scientists to calculate how much impact climate change has had on particular events - if any. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

On a crisp autumn morning, a Labrador with a shiny black coat zigzags over broken concrete and steel rebar. There are overturned boats, piles of wood, a broken-down bus. As he climbs the small mountain of rubble, his nose is down, tail straight. This dog is working — focused and searching for a person. The thing is, we're at a training ground in the back of a construction site outside Baltimore. The person he's looking for is fine, hiding with a walkie-talkie. And all that rubble was brought in for the purpose of teaching dogs to find people after a disaster, as part of a program by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Around the country, FEMA has 280 certified detection dogs trained to find people in disasters, and it has another 80 that look for human remains. They deploy everywhere from collapsed buildings to natural disasters. Earlier this year, 35 dogs were sent to Hawaii to recover bodies of people who died in the wildfires. At the training site outside Baltimore, Maryland Task Force One is putting its dogs through their paces. Victoria Ledwell is at the helm, working as both the canine coordinator and a dog handler for FEMA's Urban Search and Rescue squad. As a retired firefighter, she's used to responding to emergencies. Ledwell and her dog Pasquale were deployed to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Fiona and, later, to South Florida after Hurricane Ian.

""I love this part of it,"" Ledwell says as she gestures toward a dog doing drills. ""They love what they're doing and I love watching that. ... You'll see them come off the pile after they've done a search and they've been successful. Some of them will carry their toy with them, and they're so proud and they'll show it off to you."" As the one overseeing the training, Ledwell begins the day by huddling with about a dozen handlers. She congratulates one team for passing an exam, but when the group claps, the handler brushes it off, directing the praise to the work of his canine partner. ""I just stood there and looked pretty. That's my job,"" he says, laughing. Many of these dogs are already FEMA certified but are back at training and doing drills because the handler-canine pairs have to be recertified every three years. Later, as Ledwell is explaining the process, she's interrupted by enthusiastic barking — a dog has zeroed in on one of several ""bark barrels"" — big plastic tubes used in search and rescue training. They are dotted around the training site and feature a small opening, just big enough for a dog's snout. Only one of these bark barrels has a person inside, so the dogs are put to the test. Parker successfully finds someone in a bark barrel.Haiyun Jiang for NPRhide caption Parker successfully finds someone in a bark barrel. The training site is designed to test all aspects of the canine rescuers.Haiyun Jiang for NPRhide caption The training site is designed to test all aspects of the canine rescuers. This dog has just found its prize and the barking goes on for about 20 seconds. The handler lets the dog know the mission is accomplished, and the volunteer inside emerges with a small container of food ready to reward their canine rescuer, along with plenty of pats and praise. In this case the prize was food, but typically it's a specific toy that the dog chose itself. The dog only gets it as a reward during training and missions. When handlers and their dogs are deployed, each has to pack that special toy. ""My last dog had what we called 'the flying squirrel',"" Ledwell said. ""It was like a floppy Frisbee, and it didn't fit well into pockets. But it didn't matter that it was hard for me to carry, because for him that was important. I had to make it work."" A lot of the dogs on Maryland Task Force One are Labradors, but the teams are made up of a range of breeds including German shepherds, golden retrievers, springer spaniels and mixed breeds. Some of these dogs started out as strays or in a shelter — dogs like Pager. Pager is an excitable boy who likes to chew things and lick faces. He's a big Labrador from a kennel in Maine and was sent to a ""puppies behind bars"" program at just 8 weeks old, where he would've been trained for police or wounded veterans programs. But Pager was too rambunctious and high-energy. Pager plays with his handler, Joshua Kurland.Haiyun Jiang for NPRhide caption Pager plays with his handler, Joshua Kurland.

That's how he ended up alongside his handler, Joshua Kurland, a canine search specialist with this task force. Kurland has been a handler for more than a decade, and he also works for Montgomery County Fire & Rescue. The fire academy is where he first became interested in working with dogs. ""I probably should've been paying attention to my fire skills, but I saw canines working and I thought, 'Oh, the fire department has canines',"" he says with a laugh. ""Hopefully Pager does all right here,"" Kurland says as he and Pager walk out to an open field for a drill. There are wooden tables set up like a baseball diamond, each about 75 feet apart. In case of instability in a pile of rubble, dogs sometimes search while their humans stand on solid ground, so handlers like Kurland have to be able to control them from a safe distance. Kurland and Pager share a moment of fun.Haiyun Jiang for NPRhide caption Kurland and Pager share a moment of fun.

Kurland shouts as Pager barrels toward the wooden platform and jumps up, only to slide off due to the morning dew. ""Pager, back!"" After a few tries, Pager gets the hang of it — hopping up when told, then turning around and sitting, waiting for Kurland's approval. ""Pager, come!"" He dashes back. ""Good boy!"" Kurland rewards Pager with his special toy — a tug with a rope on the end — and they play fetch in the field as his reward. It wasn't a perfect run, but it would've passed, according to Kurland. The team puts on helmets and waits around a massive pile of concrete to send Pager in for another drill. Two people are hiding in the rubble — one volunteer has carefully lowered himself into a concrete tube that's surrounded by bricks and broken slabs for the rescue simulation. Throughout the rubble are ""distractors,"" such as bags of dirty laundry and food — anything to try to throw the dogs off the scent of finding someone. Kurland takes off Pager's leash and collar and he gets to work. He darts across the pile, nose down, homing in. Within minutes, he's barking, alerting Kurland that he found someone until Kurland carefully makes his way over and rewards him. Shaffner rewards Parker with some pets.Haiyun Jiang for NPRhide caption Shaffner rewards Parker with some pets. He struggles a bit to find the next person, going back and forth, passing the hiding spot a few times before eventually finding it. Once he begins barking, the volunteer in the tube rewards Pager with his toy and they get into an enthusiastic game of tug of war. A group of tough handlers in uniform, watching stoically, immediately melt when Pager makes his rescue. As he makes his way back off the pile, they collectively raise their voices an octave to congratulate Pager with pets and baby talk. To the team, that's potentially another life saved. But to Pager, he's just a very good boy doing his job."

Ocean eddies are enormous. They're usually hundreds of kilometers across (100–300km), up to 2km deep and can be visible from space.It turns out these eddies drive change underwater by spawning marine heat waves. Ournew research, published inCommunications Earth & Environment, demonstrates the link between a warm ocean eddy and a record-breaking marine heat wave which struck off Sydney from December 2021 to February 2022.Now it's happening again. An even bigger eddy is forming about 50km off Sydney. We have just returned from a 24-day research voyage on CSIRO's research vesselRV Investigatorto explore this monster eddy.Our estimates suggest this 400km wide beast holds 30% more heat than normal for this part of the ocean. Its currents are spinning at 8km per hour. And the temperatures deep underwater are up to 3°C above normal. If it moves close to shore, it could trigger another coastal marine heat wave.How can an eddy current make a heat wave?Eddies are the ocean equivalent of storms in the atmosphere. Likeweather patterns, they can be warm or cold. But ocean eddies can shape the ocean's patterns of life.Warm eddies are like ocean deserts with little life, while cold eddies are typically much more productive. That's because they draw up nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous from the deep sea, which become food for plankton.Just as storms can in the atmosphere, ocean eddies can drive extreme ""ocean weather."" That's because warm eddies can bring in masses of warm water and keep it there for months. Sea life is often very finely attuned to temperature, so a sudden heat wave like this can heavily impact ecosystems.It's important to better understand how eddy currents grow, move and decay better. That's because they can store large amounts of heat and can temporarily increase coastal sea levels.What we do know is that warm eddies along Australia's east coast can be fed by the East Australian Current when it becomes unstable. The current wobbles back and forth until eventually the wobbles form a coherent circle—an eddy—or adding to an existing one. It's like a garden hose thrashing around on the grass when the flow is too great. These unstable currents can be small, on the kilometer scale, or huge.Our research pinpointed the root cause of the 2021 marine heat wave off Sydney. A large warm eddy formed. But it couldn't spiral away intodeeper waters, because there were cold eddies to the north and south preventing it. That's very similar to what can happen in the atmosphere, where a high pressure system can be held in place by other weather systems.Now, it looks as if history is repeating.Over the past month, an enormous eddy—fully 400km wide and 3km deep—has been spinning up just off southeastern Australia. It's being fed by the warm East Australian Current, which bringswarm waterfrom the tropics down to more temperate waters. This eddy is bigger and warmer than most eddies in the region, especially at this time of year. It has been growing over the past month, and is pushing up against cold waters to the south. Where the two systems meet there are very strong temperature differences—up to 5°C over just 4km.You can get some insight into howeddy currents behave from satellites.Our trip on the research vessel RV Investigator made it possible for us to grasp how this powerful current was behaving—in three dimensions.We also released drifters, GPS-tracked buoys which float around the eddy center in a massive circle. Some have been carried more than 2,000km in the last month, passing where they originally started. Others have escaped the eddy and headed east into the Pacific.These sensors and instruments have given us vital information. Now we know the water in the eddy is flowing at a fast walking pace, around 8km per hour. And we know that while the currents within the eddy are rotating quickly, the eddy itself has remained fairly stationary off the NSW coast, growing with warm waters from further north.We also deployed five divingArgo floats. Satellite data shows ussurface temperaturesin the eddy have hit 23°C, 2° above average for a month. But Argo floats show us the temperatures are even more extreme 500m below the surface, more than 3°C above average.What happens to eddies? Like atmospheric systems, these are effectively heat engines. They transport heat to new areas as they whirl in the ocean. While they hold heat a long time, eventually it's lost to the atmosphere and through mixing at the edges of the current. Eventually, they disappear.But as we head into summer, the mega eddy is unlikely to go anywhere. If it moves towards the coast, where marine life is concentrated, we will see water temperatures spike—and possibly, underwater disaster for many species.We would like to thank the RV Investigator's Master, Captain Andrew Roebuck, Deck Officers and crew and the CSIRO technical staff."

The increasing floods, tropical storms, atmospheric rivers, hurricanes and the temperature of the oceans in Miami should already have put you on high alert. Earth is warming at an alarming rate, and what we need now is to mobilize action and funding for climate solutions that can help prevent a global climate crisis. There is a crisis in funding for communities and climate. The research is clear: Host countries, companies, organizations and individuals that are leading on climate are stepping up their decarbonization efforts as well as mitigating carbon emissions in a variety of forms, with much of their effort coming through the purchase of carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market. The problem I see is that there's currently a small cohort of individuals and academic pundits in the climate space who are deciding what’s appropriate climate action and what’s not. This has caused massive uncertainty in the market and is holding back investment and climate action at a time when we need it most. I argue that these efforts to define the “chosen” path to climate success are killing ambition, not raising it. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has said it in many different ways: We need everything, and we need it now. This means that as business leaders and individuals, we must both reduce our emissions wherever possible and also draw emissions from the atmosphere. We may need to be better at how we measure success, but I’ll get to that. Reducing emissions of your NPO or your personal life takes a lot of forms: Reduce reliance on fossil fuels in whatever ways we can. Reduce road trips and flights, and take rail or public transport if possible. Reduce our reliance on plastics, and recycle and reuse where we can. Cut back on food waste. Switch to renewable energy. We also need to reduce illegal logging and deforestation, since a cut tree will eventually result in emissions. We need to provide electricity to off-grid communities to prevent emissions from alternative fuels such as kerosene. We must reduce methane emissions right now, as capturing or destroying this giga-pollutant is one of the fastest ways we have to make an immediate impact on global warming. Methane is 80 times worse for the environment in a 20-year time frame than CO2. Methane activities include reducing methane emissions from livestock and human sanitation or creating proper landfills to take the place of roadside dumps so that methane emissions can be measured, captured and used to create electricity or flared into a less offensive gas. We need to reduce emissions from old refrigerants or fire-fighting gases. Not all of these will apply to your NPO, but you can still be a steward for climate action by calling upon others who are contributing to these irresponsible emissions. We also need to remove CO2 already in the atmosphere. This means investments to plant new forests or replace ones that have been destroyed, or to support the development of new technologies for the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. I believe that a carbon market solution can accomplish all these things, and by investing in it, your NPO can make a tangible impact. The methodology, supply, interest, funding and demand are all in place and efficient. Still, nothing is moving because many academics and carbon experts have taken the view that these third-party verified and validated emission reductions must be overestimated. Unfortunately, carbon accounting has not—and, in my opinion, cannot—ever be an exact science. There is no doubt that not everyone agrees on the best way to count emission reductions. Some methods endorsed by critics are misguided or based on faulty research or conclusions, and most can easily be rebutted by the project if given equal exposure. Yes, I recognize that some methods put forth by the carbon market need newer science. However, it is important to note that the ability to measure and count emissions has improved over time as new science and methodologies become available. In fact, two initiatives I'm familiar with—the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (for which I serve as a board member) and the Voluntary Carbon Market Integrity Initiative—are now providing end-to-end accountability and oversight on emission reduction accounting, quality, integrity and the application of emission reductions to corporate goals. In addition, carbon crediting programs or carbon standards are enlisting help from experts to further review their (already) peer-reviewed and approved methodologies to see where immediate improvements can be made. My perspective is that carbon crediting standards must improve their methodologies, science must help guide better measurement of reductions and we must move quickly to adopt improvements at the project level. I think critics of the carbon market hope that by calling out problems with project accounting for specific projects, the world will walk away from a market-based solution to climate. What they fail to realize is that without this source of financing, solving the crisis with government or philanthropy alone will be impossible. It is only with a functioning market that we can raise ambition from the private sector. The knowledge that funding can be delivered effectively, efficiently and at scale to mitigate the worst effects of climate change should unlock a torrent of ambition. We should also take pride in what is being accomplished with a viable market: Millions of hectares of forest have been protected from deforestation and degradation, millions of dollars have landed in marginalized communities for adaptation and resilience, thousands of jobs have been created, hundreds of roadside dumps have been closed and countless people are now gathering less fuel for cooking. These are just a few of the examples of the impact a healthy voluntary carbon market can have that I’ve seen firsthand. So please don’t kill ambition—let’s raise it!

Worlds most loved landmarks; Taj Mahal secures 2nd spot,Climate,"PARIS: Much of northwestern Europe went on high alert Wednesday as a storm dubbed Ciaran threatened to bring gale-force winds and extreme rainfall to the region. Three French departments -- Finistere, Cotes-d'Armor and Manche -- will be placed on red storm alert, the highest level, at midnight (2300 GMT), national weather agency Meteo-France said. Meteorologists warned that the Ile-de-France region, which includes the capital Paris, could have violent wind gusts. The SNCF rail network said it would halt service on several of its suburban commuter lines around the capital, including the popular RER A train that serves western suburbs.Two French regions will also be placed on maximum flood alert, it added.Vast stretches along the French coast, from the Gironde region to the northern Hauts de France, will be on the lower category orange alert. In Pas-de-Calais, authorities said they would open two gymnasiums and several shelters for migrants who converge on the region, hoping to make it to Britain by boat. In Britain, the meteorological office said there would be bursts of heavy rain, a risk of flooding in some areas and gusts of 60-70 miles per hour along England's south coast.In France, the storm was even expected to unleash winds of up to 170 kilometres (106 miles) per hour, notably on the coastlines of Brittany and Normandy in the northwest, Meteo-France forecaster Francois Gourand warned on Tuesday. Rainfall could reach 50 millimetres within just six hours in those areas, the weather agency said. Ciaran is expected to hit Brittany before midnight Wednesday, with winds of up to 150 kmph on the coast, and 130 kmph inland with a second, more violent, storm phase following some hours later.- Rail services cancelled -Some 3,200 firefighters will be deployed in the most exposed areas, the French interior ministry said. The authorities, warning of falling trees and blocked roads, have urged people to remain indoors and stay away from the coast. The government also banned all truck traffic in Brittany for Thursday. National rail operator SNCF has stopped regional trains in the most affected areas and cancelled a number of high-speed TGV rail services. Eurostar, expecting disruptions and slowdowns, told AFP it was recommending that passengers delay any trips planned for Thursday. The Brittany airports of Brest and Quimper were ordered closed, and most ferry traffic to Breton islands is to be stopped.Coastal flooding is likely from early Thursday, Olivier Caumont, also at Meteo-France, told reporters, with waves possibly rising up to 10 metres (33 feet). Maritime authorities issued a strong warning against taking boats out to sea, or even approaching the coast ""be it by car or on foot"".- 'Lie low, fingers crossed' -They also said a powerful tugboat would be deployed to help any vessels in distress.""All we can do is to lie low and keep our fingers crossed,"" said Olivier Laban, president of the shellfish farming committee in the Arcachon basin in France's southwest.In Britain Kate Marks, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said ""significant flooding"" was possible, warning people to stay away from swollen rivers and motorists not to drive through flood water.Storm Ciaran comes less than two weeks after Storm Babet claimed five lives in the UK in heavy flooding and high winds.""Some parts of south Wales and southwest England may see 80 mm (more than three inches) of rain,"" said Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Dan Suri.Flooding due to heavy rain has already seen some 12,000 sandbags deployed in the east of Northern Ireland.The Channel Islands, off the coast of northern France, have also been warned to prepare for flooding.- As far as Spain -In Belgium, the weather office issued an orange alert for the Flemish coast, a yellow alert for the rest of the country, and urged ""great caution"".The cities of Brussels, Antwerp and Liege announced that parks would be closed.The Flemish provinces of West Flanders and East Flanders both said they would close access to outdoor sports facilities, and ban people from entering forests or natural reserves.In neighbouring Netherlands, the weather service issued a code yellow alert for Thursday, while motorists were advised to work from home to avoid traffic jams.Several schools said they would be closed or partially closed on Thursday. Ciaran's impact could be felt as far south as Spain, where wind speeds of up to 90 kph were expected for Thursday. Authorities asked people to take down tarpaulins, avoid walking under trees and remove flower pots from balconies.While storms are a naturally recurring phenomenon, they can be made worse by climate change, according to scientists. Flooding is likely to be exacerbated by rising ocean levels as a result of melting glaciers."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following management's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability. You may begin. Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Sustainability, Assurant, Inc. Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2023 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the third quarter 2023. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with remarks from Keith and Richard, before moving into a Q&A session. Some of the statements made today are forward looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations, and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release and financial supplement, as well as in our SEC reports. During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement. I will now turn the call over to Keith. Keith Demmings, President & Chief Executive Officer, Assurant, Inc. Thanks, Suzanne. And good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the exceptionally strong results we achieved in the third quarter, with Adjusted EBITDA excluding catastrophes growing nearly 50% year-over- year or 19% on a year-to-date basis, both ahead of our expectations. Our results were largely driven by continued momentum in Global Housing, and our steadfast focus on executing our strategy, including driving innovation, creating efficiencies and strengthening our global partnerships. These efforts have positioned us to exceed our previous expectations of high single-digit Adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding catastrophes. We now expect Adjusted EBITDA growth of mid-to-high teens. Our year-to-date performance highlights Assurant's competitive differentiators, including our advantaged Global Housing and Global Lifestyle businesses that have proven leadership positions with scale and significant cash generation. Combined, these businesses are extending Assurant's track record of strong financial performance, thanks in part to the swift actions we've taken across our global operations to improve results and strengthen the business given broader macroeconomic headwinds. We continue to realize benefits from the actions we announced in 2022 to simplify our business and corporate real estate and realign our organizational structure, allowing us to reinvest throughout the enterprise. We extended our 2022 restructuring plan to include additional actions across the enterprise as we believe further enhancing Assurant's operational efficiency will support our long-term profitable growth and value creation. We now expect total restructuring costs associated with our extended plan to be between $90 million to $95 million pre-tax, above our previously announced expectations of $60 million to $65 million. Looking at our business segments, in Global Housing, I want to thank all of our employees who supported policyholders impacted by Hurricane Idalia and the Hawaii wildfires, as well as several other significant weather events during the quarter. Assurant plays a critical role in safeguarding our policyholders and supporting the U.S. mortgage industry. Our Global Housing Adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, more than doubled year-over-year and increased 72% year-to-date, led by significant growth in our Homeowners business through topline growth and improving loss experience. Our ability to quickly execute changes, particularly in our lender-placed business, has helped us gain earnings momentum from higher in-force policies, average insured values and state- approved rate increases following inflation impacts in 2022. Our performance so far this year highlights Global Housing's compelling and uniquely positioned portfolio. Year-to-date, including $89 million of reportable catastrophes, our combined ratio is 82% and our annualized ROE is 29%, demonstrating strong returns and cash generation. In our Renters business, we saw continued strength in our property management channel, where policies in-force have grown double digits this year. We continue to win new clients, grow existing partnerships and release new capabilities, including our upgraded leasing agent portal and digital insurance tracking enhancements. We're very pleased with Global Housing's strong performance year-to-date, which reflects our focused execution around streamlined product lines where we have a clear competitive advantage and scale. Turning to Global Lifestyle, third quarter earnings increased 7% year-over-year, or 14% excluding a onetime client benefit within Connected Living last year. Year-to-date, Adjusted EBITDA, down 6% versus the same period in 2022, has continued to improve throughout the year and is tracking in line with our expectations of a modest decline for the full year. Within Connected Living, we continue to support long-term growth through the development of innovative offerings, for our partners. U.S. Connected Living is poised for another year of solid growth, particularly within our mobile protection business, a testament to our breadth of innovative offerings, customer experience expertise, and deep relationships with mobile carriers and cable operators. As macroeconomic headwinds have persisted, including impacts from inflation, we've taken decisive action across our global operations to mitigate these impacts. In Europe, expense actions have allowed us to stabilize earnings as we focus on critical opportunities to grow our topline. We also continue to invest to advance product innovation and anticipate our clients' needs as well as improve customer experience through expanded service delivery capabilities. For example, as part of the extension of our 2022 plan to realize benefits and simplify our business and corporate real estate, we're consolidating our mobile device care centers into two sites in the U.S. We'll move the services currently offered in York, Pennsylvania, to our existing facility in Texas. Over time, we'll be investing in a new site, in Nashville, where we can leverage a strong talent market and greater logistics efficiencies as we evolve with emerging clients. Turning to our Global Auto business, we're beginning to see initial signs of claims improvement as a result of the decisive actions taken over the last year to improve performance. These actions included implementing rate increases on new policies across impacted clients and advancing opportunities to improve loss experience for programs where we hold the risk. We continue to monitor claims costs closely and expect improvement will be gradual over time given the way the Auto business earns. In Auto, we launched Assurant Vehicle Care at over 500 dealers. Building on decades of proprietary data on cost of claims, Assurant Vehicle Care is a comprehensive new suite of vehicle protection products. It was developed to help our dealer partners optimize product design, pricing, training and sales to ultimately enhance attachment and economics. For the consumer, Assurant Vehicle Care provides a digital experience with more vehicle coverage, flexibility and transparency. Now let's turn to our enterprise outlook and capital. Given our year-to-date results and our business outlook for the remainder of 2023, we now expect Adjusted EBITDA to grow mid-to-high teens, excluding catastrophes. Adjusted EPS growth is now expected to exceed Adjusted EBITDA growth, each excluding catastrophes. This is primarily due to higher earnings growth that now more than offsets the increase in depreciation expense. From a capital perspective, we upstreamed $202 million of segment dividends during the third quarter and $493 million year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with $491 million of holding company liquidity consistent with the end of the second quarter. In terms of share repurchases, during the third quarter, repurchases totaled $50 million. This brings our total repurchases to approximately $100 million for the year, including an additional $30 million of shares purchased through the end of October. Based on our strong year-to-date results, we expect fourth quarter buybacks to accelerate from third quarter levels and to be approximately $200 million for the year, consistent with our underlying repurchase activity in 2022. We're pleased with our strong capital position, which affords us more long-term flexibility over time. Looking to 2024, we expect a more modest level of earnings growth in Global Housing, excluding catastrophes, building on strong 2023 financial results, which included $40 million of favorable prior-year reserve development. In Global Lifestyle, we expect earnings growth to be led by Connected Living, particularly in the U.S., from the expansion of current programs, as we work to gradually improve the Auto business, which we will continue to manage closely. From a capital perspective, we're committed to maintaining flexibility for our strong balance sheet and deploying capital for share repurchases and opportunistic acquisitions to support our growth objectives. We will share our 2024 outlook in February factoring in our fourth quarter earnings, business trends, as well as the latest forecasts of the macro environment for the year. In the near-term, we're focused on achieving our 2023 objectives, and setting a path for continued growth and value creation in 2024 and beyond. As we look ahead, we remain committed to execution, innovation and enhancing the customer experience for our clients and their end consumers, particularly as we look to capitalize on growth opportunities, while supporting continued momentum. Before I turn the call over to Richard, to review the third quarter results and our 2023 outlook in greater detail, I want to once again thank our employees for their hard work and dedication to deliver for our clients. Our company was recently recognized as one of TIME's Best Companies in the World, highlighting Assurant's strong employee satisfaction, revenue growth and sustainability efforts. Assurant was also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's Greenest Companies, demonstrating our commitment to and progress in operating more sustainably. The recognition was timely as we recently introduced Carbon IQ by Assurant. This offering enables clients to see the carbon impact of each device, including new and refurbished devices, and provides them with estimated CO2 emissions throughout the supply chain and lifecycle to identify opportunities for reduction. We're honored to be recognized for our outstanding culture, products and sustainability, all of which help us better-serve our clients. And now, over to Richard. Richard Dziadzio, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Assurant, Inc. Thank you, Keith. For the third quarter of 2023, Adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $357 million, up $118 million, or nearly 50% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $4.68 for the quarter, delivering year-over- year growth of 67%. To review results in greater detail, let's start with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported Adjusted EBITDA of $192 million in the third quarter, an increase of $12 million or 7% year-over-year. As a reminder, prior period results included a one-time client benefit of $11 million within Connected Living. Excluding the prior period gain, Global Lifestyle's Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% or $24 million. This increase was primarily driven by higher contributions from investment income and mobile growth. Connected Living earnings increased $30 million or 32%, excluding the one-time client benefit, demonstrating strong mobile growth from North American device protection programs, from carrier and cable operator clients and better trade- in performance. Financial services also contributed to the growth. Trade-in results benefited from improved margins related to higher sales prices for used devices, partially offset by lower volumes impacted by the timing and structure of carrier promotions. In Europe, we stabilized performance through expense actions, mitigating the impact of headwinds that began in the second half of 2022. In Japan, results were impacted by subscriber decline, which is expected to continue into 2024. Global Auto Adjusted EBITDA declined $6 million or 8%. Results continue to be impacted by inflation of labor and parts leading to higher average claims costs. As expected, claims experience for Auto ancillary products has also contributed to higher incurred claims costs in the quarter. The Auto earnings decline was partially offset by an increase in investment income from higher yields and asset values. Turning to net earned premiums, fees and other income. Lifestyle was up by $83 million or 4%. This growth was primarily driven by Global Automotive, reflecting an increase of 6% from prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Connected Living's net earned premiums, fees and other income increased 3%. Growth was muted by the previously disclosed mobile program contract changes of approximately $55 million with no corresponding impacts to profitability. Excluding the impact of these contract changes, Connected Living's net earned premiums, fees and other income grew by 8%. The quarter benefited from higher prices on used mobile devices and modest growth in North America mobile subscribers excluding ongoing client runoff. Turning to the full year 2023, we continue to expect Lifestyle's Adjusted EBITDA to decline modestly. Global Auto will be down for the full year from unfavorable loss experience, including the impacts from continued normalization for select ancillary products previously mentioned. We've taken decisive actions this year in response to higher claims experience in our Auto book, including prospective rate increases and repair cost reduction. While we've seen some improvement, the improvement is expected to take place over a longer period of time given the earnings pattern of the business. In Connected Living, we expect our U.S. business to grow for the full year. Overall, we are pleased with Lifestyle's strong third quarter performance, especially in light of ongoing challenges in Auto claims. For the fourth quarter, we expect higher trade-in volumes in mobile, but we also expect ongoing topline challenges in Japan and Europe and investments to support business growth. In terms of full year net earned premiums, fees and other income, Lifestyle is expected to grow consistent with year-to-date trends. Moving to Global Housing, Adjusted EBITDA was $165 million, which included $26 million in reportable catastrophes, primarily from Hurricane Idalia and Hawaii wildfires. Excluding reportable catastrophes, Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $191 million, with an increase of $106 million. Housing performance was mainly led by three main items. First, continued topline growth in Homeowners from higher premium rates and average insured values in lender-placed, as well as an increase in the number of in-force policies. Second, favorable non-cat loss experience across the segment, including a year-over-year positive impact of $39 million related to prior period reserve development. This was comprised of $15 million of reserve reductions in the current quarter compared to reserve strengthening of $24 million in the prior period. And lastly, additional scale within our Homeowners expense base ultimately driving stronger operating leverage. Higher investment income also contributed to earnings growth for Homeowners. For Renters and others, earnings grew modestly from favorable prior period reserve development. Growth within the property management channel was offset by softer affinity channel volumes. For the full year 2023, we expect Global Housing Adjusted EBITDA excluding reportable cats, to grow significantly due to the strong Homeowners performance driven by topline expansion lender-placed and favorable non-cat loss experience. In the fourth quarter, we expect higher expenses to support business growth. In addition, the third quarter included $15 million of favorable prior period development. Moving to Corporate. The third quarter Adjusted EBITDA loss was $26 million, representing a modest year- over-year increase, mainly related to higher employee expenses. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect the Corporate Adjusted EBITDA loss to approximate $105 million. Turning to holding company liquidity, we ended the quarter with $491 million, and dividends from our operating segments totaled $202 million. In addition to cash used for corporate and interest expenses, third quarter cash outflows included three items, $50 million of share repurchases, $37 million for common stock dividends, and $50 million to complete the repayment of our September 2023 Notes. As Keith mentioned, given our year-to-date performance and outlook for the year as well as the strength of Assurant's balance sheet, we expect to achieve full year share repurchases of approximately $200 million. For the full year, we continue to expect our businesses to generate meaningful cash flows approximating 65% of segment Adjusted EBITDA, including reportable catastrophes. Cash flow expectations assume a continuation of the current economic environment and are subject to the growth of the businesses, investment portfolio performance and rating agency and regulatory requirements. In closing, through the resilience of our unique business model, the decisive management actions taken and our intense client focus, we are confident in our ability to achieve the higher full year objectives we have outlined today. And with that, Operator, please open the call for questions. QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION Operator:The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question is coming from the line of Mark Hughes of Truist. Your line is open. certainly haven't topped out in terms of the impact from the rate adjustments. But we do see it tapering and slowing certainly as we think about Q4 as we head into to 2024. But year-to-date, feel good with where our loss ratio sit. In Housing, we're 42% non-cat loss ratio, if you adjust for prior period development, very consistent with where we were last year. So we feel like the rates that we have are certainly appropriate. And as we see impacts on cost of claims we'll modify as we go forward. :Then the one final one. Your fee income was up in Lifestyle, your devices serviced were down 20% plus. I think you mentioned higher value per device. Anything else contributing to that? Just the divergence between the fee income and the devices serviced. :Yes. So, I think if we think about that year-over-year, certainly volumes are down. We saw softer promotional activity in the third quarter, not out of alignment with what we expected. We did see a pickup in the back half of September, obviously after new product introduced - introduction by Apple. So hopefully that sets us up with what we'd expect in the fourth quarter to be an improvement there. And as I look at that business, we've done a really nice job, in driving operational efficiency in automation to continue to improve the efficiency with which we operate. And then, as you said, we've gotten higher sale prices when we're selling devices. And obviously, we derive revenue based on how well we sell devices in the secondary market. But I'd say there's not much else to report. Profitability a little bit stronger. But if you'll remember, third quarter last year, we had a bit of a mismatch between expenses and revenue. So, Q3 trade-in results were a little bit depressed last year. :Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. think in June or July, but I guess 12% last year. So maybe kind of a mix there earning through. What's rate at? How much was the rate component? And how much was the unit growth component? I'm just trying to think of the different parts there. So maybe I can start and then certainly Richard can jump in. Obviously, when you look at Housing's revenue year-over-year, it's up meaningfully, $100 million, $103 million year-over-year. All of that is from growth in Homeowners, which is up 31% year-over-year, in terms of revenue. If we think about what's driving the performance, from an underlying EBITDA perspective, and Richard obviously talked about the prior period development, if you adjust the development, $15 million this year against an adverse development last year of $24 million, we still see a $67 million increase in our underlying EBITDA. And I would say two-thirds of that is really driven by rates, average insured values, which obviously play together and then, relatively stable losses related to higher levels of premium rolling through. And then the balance, maybe a third is split between policy growth, which is up 3.5% year-over- year, and then investment income, which is obviously helping with cash yields and more assets being held. But Richard, happy to have you add any other detail. :Yes, sure. Yes, that's exact. And I guess I would add and - by the way, good morning, Jeff. What I would add is that if you just look at the premium component that Keith just talked about, think about it generally as being a third for each of the components that we've just discussed. It's the increase in rates, average insured values, and inflation guard. That's sort of the way to look at it. And the other thing, too, that I would mention is, you see, I mean, you heard Keith talk about how much drops to the bottom line. I think that's also a credit to the expense discipline that we've had and the leverage we're getting. And you can see that coming out in the expense ratios that the growth in the premiums and the leverage that we have in the business is really allowing us to increase the bottom line. :Got it. Very helpful. And then in Global Lifestyle, just looking at that benefit ratio, kind of continues to move up despite rate increases. It was 23% in the quarter, mainly driven by Auto, it sounds like. Could you maybe just discuss the pricing strategy there? Like, when did that began, what level of pricing can you get in this market? Really, any detail on that would be helpful. :Yes, I can certainly start, Richard. So, if I think about the Auto business, actually pleased with the work done by our team, so we started making adjustments to rate late Attachments Disclaimer Assurant Inc.published this content on02 November 2023and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following management's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability. You may begin. Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Sustainability, Assurant, Inc. Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2023 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the third quarter 2023. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with remarks from Keith and Richard, before moving into a Q&A session. Some of the statements made today are forward looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations, and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release and financial supplement, as well as in our SEC reports. During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement. I will now turn the call over to Keith. Keith Demmings, President & Chief Executive Officer, Assurant, Inc. Thanks, Suzanne. And good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the exceptionally strong results we achieved in the third quarter, with Adjusted EBITDA excluding catastrophes growing nearly 50% year-over- year or 19% on a year-to-date basis, both ahead of our expectations. Our results were largely driven by continued momentum in Global Housing, and our steadfast focus on executing our strategy, including driving innovation, creating efficiencies and strengthening our global partnerships. These efforts have positioned us to exceed our previous expectations of high single-digit Adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding catastrophes. We now expect Adjusted EBITDA growth of mid-to-high teens. Our year-to-date performance highlights Assurant's competitive differentiators, including our advantaged Global Housing and Global Lifestyle businesses that have proven leadership positions with scale and significant cash generation. Combined, these businesses are extending Assurant's track record of strong financial performance, thanks in part to the swift actions we've taken across our global operations to improve results and strengthen the business given broader macroeconomic headwinds. We continue to realize benefits from the actions we announced in 2022 to simplify our business and corporate real estate and realign our organizational structure, allowing us to reinvest throughout the enterprise. We extended our 2022 restructuring plan to include additional actions across the enterprise as we believe further enhancing Assurant's operational efficiency will support our long-term profitable growth and value creation. We now expect total restructuring costs associated with our extended plan to be between $90 million to $95 million pre-tax, above our previously announced expectations of $60 million to $65 million. Looking at our business segments, in Global Housing, I want to thank all of our employees who supported policyholders impacted by Hurricane Idalia and the Hawaii wildfires, as well as several other significant weather events during the quarter. Assurant plays a critical role in safeguarding our policyholders and supporting the U.S. mortgage industry. Our Global Housing Adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, more than doubled year-over-year and increased 72% year-to-date, led by significant growth in our Homeowners business through topline growth and improving loss experience. Our ability to quickly execute changes, particularly in our lender-placed business, has helped us gain earnings momentum from higher in-force policies, average insured values and state- approved rate increases following inflation impacts in 2022. Our performance so far this year highlights Global Housing's compelling and uniquely positioned portfolio. Year-to-date, including $89 million of reportable catastrophes, our combined ratio is 82% and our annualized ROE is 29%, demonstrating strong returns and cash generation. In our Renters business, we saw continued strength in our property management channel, where policies in-force have grown double digits this year. We continue to win new clients, grow existing partnerships and release new capabilities, including our upgraded leasing agent portal and digital insurance tracking enhancements. We're very pleased with Global Housing's strong performance year-to-date, which reflects our focused execution around streamlined product lines where we have a clear competitive advantage and scale. Turning to Global Lifestyle, third quarter earnings increased 7% year-over-year, or 14% excluding a onetime client benefit within Connected Living last year. Year-to-date, Adjusted EBITDA, down 6% versus the same period in 2022, has continued to improve throughout the year and is tracking in line with our expectations of a modest decline for the full year. Within Connected Living, we continue to support long-term growth through the development of innovative offerings, for our partners. U.S. Connected Living is poised for another year of solid growth, particularly within our mobile protection business, a testament to our breadth of innovative offerings, customer experience expertise, and deep relationships with mobile carriers and cable operators. As macroeconomic headwinds have persisted, including impacts from inflation, we've taken decisive action across our global operations to mitigate these impacts. In Europe, expense actions have allowed us to stabilize earnings as we focus on critical opportunities to grow our topline. We also continue to invest to advance product innovation and anticipate our clients' needs as well as improve customer experience through expanded service delivery capabilities. For example, as part of the extension of our 2022 plan to realize benefits and simplify our business and corporate real estate, we're consolidating our mobile device care centers into two sites in the U.S. We'll move the services currently offered in York, Pennsylvania, to our existing facility in Texas. Over time, we'll be investing in a new site, in Nashville, where we can leverage a strong talent market and greater logistics efficiencies as we evolve with emerging clients. Turning to our Global Auto business, we're beginning to see initial signs of claims improvement as a result of the decisive actions taken over the last year to improve performance. These actions included implementing rate increases on new policies across impacted clients and advancing opportunities to improve loss experience for programs where we hold the risk. We continue to monitor claims costs closely and expect improvement will be gradual over time given the way the Auto business earns. In Auto, we launched Assurant Vehicle Care at over 500 dealers. Building on decades of proprietary data on cost of claims, Assurant Vehicle Care is a comprehensive new suite of vehicle protection products. It was developed to help our dealer partners optimize product design, pricing, training and sales to ultimately enhance attachment and economics. For the consumer, Assurant Vehicle Care provides a digital experience with more vehicle coverage, flexibility and transparency. Now let's turn to our enterprise outlook and capital. Given our year-to-date results and our business outlook for the remainder of 2023, we now expect Adjusted EBITDA to grow mid-to-high teens, excluding catastrophes. Adjusted EPS growth is now expected to exceed Adjusted EBITDA growth, each excluding catastrophes. This is primarily due to higher earnings growth that now more than offsets the increase in depreciation expense. From a capital perspective, we upstreamed $202 million of segment dividends during the third quarter and $493 million year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with $491 million of holding company liquidity consistent with the end of the second quarter. In terms of share repurchases, during the third quarter, repurchases totaled $50 million. This brings our total repurchases to approximately $100 million for the year, including an additional $30 million of shares purchased through the end of October. Based on our strong year-to-date results, we expect fourth quarter buybacks to accelerate from third quarter levels and to be approximately $200 million for the year, consistent with our underlying repurchase activity in 2022. We're pleased with our strong capital position, which affords us more long-term flexibility over time. Looking to 2024, we expect a more modest level of earnings growth in Global Housing, excluding catastrophes, building on strong 2023 financial results, which included $40 million of favorable prior-year reserve development. In Global Lifestyle, we expect earnings growth to be led by Connected Living, particularly in the U.S., from the expansion of current programs, as we work to gradually improve the Auto business, which we will continue to manage closely. From a capital perspective, we're committed to maintaining flexibility for our strong balance sheet and deploying capital for share repurchases and opportunistic acquisitions to support our growth objectives. We will share our 2024 outlook in February factoring in our fourth quarter earnings, business trends, as well as the latest forecasts of the macro environment for the year. In the near-term, we're focused on achieving our 2023 objectives, and setting a path for continued growth and value creation in 2024 and beyond. As we look ahead, we remain committed to execution, innovation and enhancing the customer experience for our clients and their end consumers, particularly as we look to capitalize on growth opportunities, while supporting continued momentum. Before I turn the call over to Richard, to review the third quarter results and our 2023 outlook in greater detail, I want to once again thank our employees for their hard work and dedication to deliver for our clients. Our company was recently recognized as one of TIME's Best Companies in the World, highlighting Assurant's strong employee satisfaction, revenue growth and sustainability efforts. Assurant was also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's Greenest Companies, demonstrating our commitment to and progress in operating more sustainably. The recognition was timely as we recently introduced Carbon IQ by Assurant. This offering enables clients to see the carbon impact of each device, including new and refurbished devices, and provides them with estimated CO2 emissions throughout the supply chain and lifecycle to identify opportunities for reduction. We're honored to be recognized for our outstanding culture, products and sustainability, all of which help us better-serve our clients. And now, over to Richard. Richard Dziadzio, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Assurant, Inc. Thank you, Keith. For the third quarter of 2023, Adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $357 million, up $118 million, or nearly 50% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $4.68 for the quarter, delivering year-over- year growth of 67%. To review results in greater detail, let's start with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported Adjusted EBITDA of $192 million in the third quarter, an increase of $12 million or 7% year-over-year. As a reminder, prior period results included a one-time client benefit of $11 million within Connected Living. Excluding the prior period gain, Global Lifestyle's Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% or $24 million. This increase was primarily driven by higher contributions from investment income and mobile growth. Connected Living earnings increased $30 million or 32%, excluding the one-time client benefit, demonstrating strong mobile growth from North American device protection programs, from carrier and cable operator clients and better trade- in performance. Financial services also contributed to the growth. Trade-in results benefited from improved margins related to higher sales prices for used devices, partially offset by lower volumes impacted by the timing and structure of carrier promotions. In Europe, we stabilized performance through expense actions, mitigating the impact of headwinds that began in the second half of 2022. In Japan, results were impacted by subscriber decline, which is expected to continue into 2024. Global Auto Adjusted EBITDA declined $6 million or 8%. Results continue to be impacted by inflation of labor and parts leading to higher average claims costs. As expected, claims experience for Auto ancillary products has also contributed to higher incurred claims costs in the quarter. The Auto earnings decline was partially offset by an increase in investment income from higher yields and asset values. Turning to net earned premiums, fees and other income. Lifestyle was up by $83 million or 4%. This growth was primarily driven by Global Automotive, reflecting an increase of 6% from prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Connected Living's net earned premiums, fees and other income increased 3%. Growth was muted by the previously disclosed mobile program contract changes of approximately $55 million with no corresponding impacts to profitability. Excluding the impact of these contract changes, Connected Living's net earned premiums, fees and other income grew by 8%. The quarter benefited from higher prices on used mobile devices and modest growth in North America mobile subscribers excluding ongoing client runoff. Turning to the full year 2023, we continue to expect Lifestyle's Adjusted EBITDA to decline modestly. Global Auto will be down for the full year from unfavorable loss experience, including the impacts from continued normalization for select ancillary products previously mentioned. We've taken decisive actions this year in response to higher claims experience in our Auto book, including prospective rate increases and repair cost reduction. While we've seen some improvement, the improvement is expected to take place over a longer period of time given the earnings pattern of the business. In Connected Living, we expect our U.S. business to grow for the full year. Overall, we are pleased with Lifestyle's strong third quarter performance, especially in light of ongoing challenges in Auto claims. For the fourth quarter, we expect higher trade-in volumes in mobile, but we also expect ongoing topline challenges in Japan and Europe and investments to support business growth. In terms of full year net earned premiums, fees and other income, Lifestyle is expected to grow consistent with year-to-date trends. Moving to Global Housing, Adjusted EBITDA was $165 million, which included $26 million in reportable catastrophes, primarily from Hurricane Idalia and Hawaii wildfires. Excluding reportable catastrophes, Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $191 million, with an increase of $106 million. Housing performance was mainly led by three main items. First, continued topline growth in Homeowners from higher premium rates and average insured values in lender-placed, as well as an increase in the number of in-force policies. Second, favorable non-cat loss experience across the segment, including a year-over-year positive impact of $39 million related to prior period reserve development. This was comprised of $15 million of reserve reductions in the current quarter compared to reserve strengthening of $24 million in the prior period. And lastly, additional scale within our Homeowners expense base ultimately driving stronger operating leverage. Higher investment income also contributed to earnings growth for Homeowners. For Renters and others, earnings grew modestly from favorable prior period reserve development. Growth within the property management channel was offset by softer affinity channel volumes. For the full year 2023, we expect Global Housing Adjusted EBITDA excluding reportable cats, to grow significantly due to the strong Homeowners performance driven by topline expansion lender-placed and favorable non-cat loss experience. In the fourth quarter, we expect higher expenses to support business growth. In addition, the third quarter included $15 million of favorable prior period development. Moving to Corporate. The third quarter Adjusted EBITDA loss was $26 million, representing a modest year- over-year increase, mainly related to higher employee expenses. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect the Corporate Adjusted EBITDA loss to approximate $105 million. Turning to holding company liquidity, we ended the quarter with $491 million, and dividends from our operating segments totaled $202 million. In addition to cash used for corporate and interest expenses, third quarter cash outflows included three items, $50 million of share repurchases, $37 million for common stock dividends, and $50 million to complete the repayment of our September 2023 Notes. As Keith mentioned, given our year-to-date performance and outlook for the year as well as the strength of Assurant's balance sheet, we expect to achieve full year share repurchases of approximately $200 million. For the full year, we continue to expect our businesses to generate meaningful cash flows approximating 65% of segment Adjusted EBITDA, including reportable catastrophes. Cash flow expectations assume a continuation of the current economic environment and are subject to the growth of the businesses, investment portfolio performance and rating agency and regulatory requirements. In closing, through the resilience of our unique business model, the decisive management actions taken and our intense client focus, we are confident in our ability to achieve the higher full year objectives we have outlined today. And with that, Operator, please open the call for questions. QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION Operator:The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question is coming from the line of Mark Hughes of Truist. Your line is open. certainly haven't topped out in terms of the impact from the rate adjustments. But we do see it tapering and slowing certainly as we think about Q4 as we head into to 2024. But year-to-date, feel good with where our loss ratio sit. In Housing, we're 42% non-cat loss ratio, if you adjust for prior period development, very consistent with where we were last year. So we feel like the rates that we have are certainly appropriate. And as we see impacts on cost of claims we'll modify as we go forward. :Then the one final one. Your fee income was up in Lifestyle, your devices serviced were down 20% plus. I think you mentioned higher value per device. Anything else contributing to that? Just the divergence between the fee income and the devices serviced. :Yes.

The increase from the comparable quarter of 2022 is primarily attributable to year-to-date net income through the third quarter of 2023 as well as a reduction in unrealized losses on the Company's fixed income securities portfolio from the third quarter of 2022. The unrealized losses are unrelated to credit risk but due to the rising interest rate environment during 2022 and 2023.

In the Belgian city of Ghent, a five-year-old Ukrainian boy and a 64-year-old woman were killed by falling branches.Falling trees had earlier killed a lorry driver in his vehicle in northern France's Aisne region, and French officials also reported the death of a man who fell from his balcony in the port city of Le Havre as the storm hammered the French coast on Thursday.Three people aboard the Danish-flagged sailboat that capsized off a beach at Torres Vedras north of Lisbon were found dead on the shore near the boat's wreckage, a navy spokesperson told AFP.A man in the Dutch town of Venray, a woman in central Madrid and a person in Germany were also killed.Some 1.2 million French homes lost electricity as the storm lashed the northwest coast. French President Emmanuel Macron visited the storm-battered region of Brittany on Friday, his office said.Residents in Tuscany Residents were busy Friday mucking out homes, garages and cellars swamped by the floodwaters.The wind gusts in the western Brittany region were ""exceptional"" and ""many absolute records have been broken"", national weather service Meteo-France said on X.The prefect for the local department said gusts as high as 207 km/h (129 mph) were recorded at Pointe du Raz on the tip of the northwest coast, while the port city of Brest saw winds hit 156 km/h.The storm interrupted rail, air and maritime traffic in Belgium where the port of Antwerp was closed and flights from Brussels were disrupted.Travel disruptionIn southern England, hundreds of schools were closed Thursday as large waves powered by winds of 135 km/h crashed along the coastline.On the Channel Island of Jersey, residents had to be evacuated to hotels overnight as gusts of up to 164 km/h damaged homes, according to local media.More than 200 flights were cancelled at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, a major European hub.Some 1.2 million French homes lost electricity as the storm lashed the northwest coast.The effects of the storm were felt as far south as Spain and Portugal.Air, rail and ferry services saw cancellations and long delays across several countries.The effects of the storm were felt as far south as Spain and Portugal, with Spanish authorities warning of waves as high as nine meters (29 feet) along the Atlantic coast.In Spain, more than 80 flights were cancelled at 11 airports.More to comeThe French weather service said storms would continue into Friday, notably in the southwest of the country and on the island of Corsica.Rail services in western parts of the country would remain disrupted on Friday, said Transport Minister Clement Beaune.Scientists have warned the world will experience more extreme weather events because of the global warming caused by greenhouse gases.""The links between climate change and winter storms in Europe are complex,"" said Hannah Cloke, professor of Hydrology at England's Reading university.""But as seas and air temperatures get warmer, we expect some winter storms to bring more rain, and potentially cause more flooding."""

The facility makes almost 25% of Pfizer's sterile injectable medicines used in the U.S.Sean Rayford/Getty Imageshide caption A tornado damaged a Pfizer pharmaceutical plant in Rocky Mount, N.C., in July. The facility makes almost 25% of Pfizer's sterile injectable medicines used in the U.S. As a pharmacist, Jason Chou didn't major in international relations. But a few days after the Hamas attack on Israel threw the Middle East into crisis, he and his colleagues started thinking about drug shortages. ""We have to look and say, well, is there production of any kind coming out of Israel?,"" saidChou, vice president of pharmacy services for Ochsner Health in New Orleans. ""It's not just the drug, too. So that's the other thing that I think we've become more sensitive to is that you have the active drug ingredient, but then you have non-active ingredients, you have vials, containers, packaging. So all of that stuff can impact ... drug availability."" So far, Chou is concerned about a handful of items, but nothing has caused a big problem yet. He and other members ofEnd Drug Shortages Alliance, a consortium of organizations affected by drug shortages, find themselves trying to anticipate drug shortages before they happen. They try to enough product stocked to weather whatever storm comes their way. And sometimes it is a literal storm. A tornadowiped out a Pfizer warehouse of drugsin July. Many of the drugs were already in short supply. There were 243 different drug shortages as of Nov. 1, according tothe American Society of Health System Pharmacists, which keeps track. The situation is a bit better than it was over the summer when the number of shortages approached a 20-year record high. But the ones that have lingered have been severe, especially for generic injectable drugs. The raw number of shortages doesn't tell the whole story, saysMichael Ganio, senior director of Pharmacy Practice and Quality with ASHP. For some pharmacists, this is the worst it's been in their decades-long careers, he says, calling the current situation ""alarming"" and ""heartbreaking."" And the kinds of drugs in short supply worsens the problems. ""Some of them involve oncology drugs, things we use to treat cancer,"" he says. ""And of course, those patients are already going through a personal struggle. But now you layer on top of that the fact that the drug that is preferred to treat their cancer may not be available."" Recent oncology drug shortages have includedcisplatin and carboplatin, generic drugs that are workhorses in chemotherapy. But oncology isn't the only part of the hospital missing crucial medications. When a patient's heart stops beating or they stop breathing, hospitals call a ""code blue."" That prompts medical staff to rush with a crash cart to revive the patient. But there have been crucial shortages of drugs needed for crash carts, like painkillers, overdose reversers and even simple saline IV bags. Those shortages leave patients, doctors and nurses in a difficult position. ""This is when you are moving and shaking to make sure that we can help maintain life,"" saysAisha Terry, President elect of the American College of Emergency Physicians. ""And when we go to that crash cart in the middle of an emergency and can't find the medications that we need, it really is not only a failure of the system, but absolutely a failure to that patient who came to us seeking help with literally sustaining their life."" Sometimes, shortages hit patients who are seeking relief for chronic pain. Pauline Cass, pharmacy manager atStoughton Hospital in Stoughton, Wisc., spoke to NPR one afternoon in September about patients awaiting steroid injections for joint pain. ""We have zero vials,"" Cass says. ""And we have six patients scheduled in the next two weeks who need the radiologists to use that injectable when they do joint injections."" So far, the hospital hasn't had to turn anyone away, because the staff has been been able to find the drug eventually. But appointments were delayed. Arecent survey by the ECRI Institute found that shortages compromised patient care. Health care workers told the nonprofit they were sometimes unable to give patients the best drug for their condition, administered less effective drugs, delayed care and even made medical errors. About a quarter of health care workers responding to the survey said they were aware of at least one error in the last six months as a result of a shortage. For example, one patient received half the dose of the anesthesia drug ketamine. The shortages prompt hospital pharmacy employees to work overtime, hunting down alternative medications. It also strains hospital budgets, especially in places where hospitals are already struggling to stay open. About half of the hospitals ASHP surveyed in mid-July say they're having to spend 5% to 10% more on overtime thanks to the shortages. And about half say they've had to spend 6% to 15% more on drugs. That's because hospitals typically have purchasing contracts to get the best prices on the generic drugs they need. When the contracted options dry up, hospitals buy drugs off-contract, a more expensive solution. ""The same drug just made by a different manufacturer can cost us double or triple the amount that we'd be spending if we were buying it on contract,"" saysChris Laman, Vice President of Strategy for Columbia Memorial Hospitalin Astoria, Ore.. A hospital pharmacist who works with Laman, Jeffrey Chow, experienced a drug shortage firsthand earlier this year. When he got a mole on his scalp biopsied, he learned that the regular numbing injection – lidocaine and epinephrine – wasn't in stock. He received only lidocaine. Normally, the epinephrine constricts blood vessels to reduce bleeding. Without it, Chow bled profusely. Blood trickled down his forehead where he could see it. ""We had to get more gauze,"" saysChow, the outpatient pharmacy manager at Columbia Memorial Hospital in Astoria, Oregon. ""It took a while to get it to stop or slow down enough to where we could bandage it up so that I could leave."" Before that,Chow said he'd grown somewhat numb to the chronic shortages plaguing the health care system. ""It was kind of just an eye-opening situation of how much it really can affect customers if they can't get what they need."""

A vehicle washed off Sidmouth Esplanade overnight was a stark reminder of the storm's 60mph (96km/h) impact, while roads were closed amid floods, fallen trees and landslips. More than 900 properties across the county were left without power and more than 250 schools were shut. Twenty flood warnings remain in place. Hundreds of trees were blown down, one damaging a police car near Kingsbridge, with its driver taken to hospital. Devon and Cornwall Police advised drivers against venturing out unless essential amid fears that rivers would burst their banks. As well as the 20 flood warnings, 29 more rivers remain on flood alert, which means flooding is possible, according to the Environment Agency. Flooding was reported by residents in Seaton, on the Jurassic Coast, where the green and playground were left waterlogged. David Noble, owner of the South Sands Hotel in Salcombe, described a ""devastating end to Storm Ciarán"" as a big swell blew off windows, doors and ""flooded the downstairs restaurant"". As mopping up continued, he said it was probably the worst storm he had experienced at the hotel since he bought it 14 years ago. Train travellers, meanwhile, have faced a ""bleak"" day, said operator GWR, which cancelled trains between Exeter and Taunton, with no replacement bus service because they too were impacted. More than 250 schools were closed across the country, Devon County Council said. On Dartmoor the rain was coming in ""horizontally"", one caller told BBC Radio Devon. ""It's blowing a hoolie out here, I think it's raining sideways,"" said Ian Cobham, from Princetown, on Dartmoor. ""If you get out of the car and walk across the car park you are soaking wet in seconds,"" said the Dartmoor Brewery manager. ""It's pretty horrible out here."" The storm's power was also evident at the Tinside Lido in Plymouth, where waves had overwhelmed the site. Meanwhile, Devon County Council's emergency control centre reported road closures across the county. While the main road between Modbury and Ermington was closed in both directions after a landslip, other impacted routes included the link road between the A38 and A380 at Haldon Hill, due to flooding, and Jubilee Road in Totnes because of a fallen tree. A planned overnight closure of part of the A30 has been called off due to flooding. In Plymouth, an emergency road closure was in place on Cliff Road after ""hoardings and boards came loose in the storm"", the city council said. Embankment Road was also closed inbound, due to an electrical fault outside a shop, with National Grid on site. In east Devon, flood water rose on land in Axminster, blocking a lane and leaving the area looking like a ""new lake"", according to one resident on social media.

Network Rail said investigations were underway to fix the fault. Disruption is expected to last until 23:00. It comes as trains in parts of Scotland were already facing delays until Saturday as a result of Storm Ciarán. LNER said there would be no services between Edinburgh and Aberdeen until Saturday. Speed restrictions will cause delays elsewhere. A yellow warning for rain is in place for the UK's east coast, from Moray down to Hull until 18:00 on Friday. Storm Ciarán caused wind gusts of more than 100mph in England on Thursday. LNER's service between Newcastle and Edinburgh was running hourly until the end of service on Friday. Speed restrictions will be in place on the route, which may see trains subject to delays of up to 40 minutes. Network Rail said it was also imposing speed restrictions across parts of Scotland and some areas would see delays. Speed restrictions will be in place on routes between Aberdeen and Inverness; Dundee and Aberdeen; Inverness and Wick; and Perth and Inverness. ScotRail said the first of these restrictions would be in place from 15:00 on Thursday and last until 08:00 on Saturday. Direct services between Edinburgh and Glasgow to Aberdeen have been cancelled from Friday morning until mid-afternoon, with passengers required to change trains at Dundee. David Simpson, ScotRail service delivery director, said: ""The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for Storm Ciaran, which is expected to bring heavy rain across the east coast of Scotland. ""Our first priority is always to ensure the safety of our staff and customers, so as a precautionary measure, speed restrictions will be in place across the Highlands and east coast. This will result in extended journey times along the affected routes."" TransPennine Express services between Newcastle and Edinburgh will also be subject to delays, with the operator urging passengers to check their journeys ahead of travel. The Met Office believes the storm's path will now be further south than originally anticipated. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has lifted half of its 12 alerts initially issued and both flood warnings in Dumfries and Galloway and Tayside. Flood warnings remain in place for Aberdeenshire, Dundee and Angus, Edinburgh and Lothians, Fife, the Scottish Borders and the area of Findhorn, Nairn, Moray and Speyside. In England, the Environment Agency has in place 82 flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected and 197 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible."

Adjusting for special items, third-quarter 2023 earnings from ongoing operations (non-GAAP) were$317 million, or$0.43per share, compared with$305 million, or$0.41per share, a year ago.

The company said it continues to expect to offset weather and storm impacts through higher distribution rider revenues inPennsylvania, better than expected execution of the Rhode Island Energy integration, lower interest costs due to PPL's convertible issuance earlier this year, and additional savings the company has achieved through effective O&M management. In updating the company's 2023 ongoing earnings forecast range today, PPL narrowed the range to$1.55to$1.60per share from$1.50to$1.65per share. The company also said it remains well-positioned to deliver top-tier earnings per share and dividend growth of 6% to 8% a year through at least 2026 without the need for equity issuances and while maintaining one of the sector's strongest credit profiles. In addition, PPL said it is on pace to achieve its projected O&M savings of at least$175 millionby 2026 and to invest nearly$2.5 billionthis year and$12 billionthrough 2026 to modernize the grid, further strengthen grid reliability and resiliency for customers as extreme weather threats increase, and advance a cleaner energy mix without compromising on affordability.

Narrowing guidance range for full year 202… [+172108 chars]",Weather,"Exelon Corporation (Nasdaq: EXC) today reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2023. “In the third quarter we continued to see strong execution of our financial plan and our strategy to lead the energy transformation, achieving top-quartile service reliability and key milestones in our six active rate reviews,” said Exelon President and CEO Calvin Butler. “As power generation decarbonizes and demand increases from development of major data center hubs, we are embarking on interstate transmission projects selected to meet reliability requirements, including PJM’s most recent recommendation to include our proposal to build needed transmission in Maryland and Pennsylvania. We also will be key partners in facilitating two of the recently announced national hydrogen hubs located in Exelon’s service areas, and three of our operating companies were also selected for federal grants through the landmark Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to improve reliability and connectivity in the communities we serve and expand benefits for our customers. We continue to be excited by the progress toward the aggressive goals we’ve set to build a sustainable energy future for our customers and communities.” “Despite an active summer storm season, Exelon’s third quarter performance remained in line with expectations, as we recorded Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings of $0.67 per share,” said Exelon Executive Vice President and CFO Jeanne Jones. “We’re also continuing to execute on the $7.2 billion capital investment planned for 2023, designed to address the needs of tomorrow’s grid. We are narrowing our 2023 EPS guidance range to $2.32 to $2.40 per share. We look forward to ending the year strong and further establishing our position as the nation’s leading transmission and delivery company.” Third Quarter 2023 Exelon's GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations for the third quarter of 2023 increased to $0.70 per share from $0.68 GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations per share in the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2023 decreased to $0.67 per share from $0.75 per share in the third quarter of 2022. For the reconciliations of GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations to Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings, refer to the tables beginning on page 3. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings in the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflect: Operating Company Results1 ComEd ComEd's third quarter of 2023 GAAP Net Income increased to $333 million from $291 million in the third quarter of 2022. ComEd's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2023 increased to $338 million from $293 million in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to increases in electric distribution formula rate earnings (reflecting higher allowed ROE due to an increase in U.S. Treasury rates and the impacts of higher rate base) and carrying costs related to the CMC regulatory asset. Due to revenue decoupling, ComEd's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns. PECO PECO’s third quarter of 2023 GAAP Net Income increased to $146 million from $135 million in the third quarter of 2022. PECO's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2023 decreased to $149 million from $174 million in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to unfavorable weather and an increase in storm costs, partially offset by gas distribution rate increases. ___________ 1Exelon’s four business units include ComEd, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois; PECO, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in southeastern Pennsylvania; BGE, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in central Maryland; and PHI, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in the District of Columbia and portions of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey and retail natural gas distribution operations in northern Delaware. BGE BGE’s third quarter of 2023 GAAP Net Income increased to $45 million from $33 million in the third quarter of 2022. BGE's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2023 decreased to $47 million from $70 million in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense, interest expense, and storm costs, partially offset by favorable impacts of the multi-year plans. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns. PHI PHI’s third quarter of 2023 GAAP Net Income decreased to $232 million from $289 million in the third quarter of 2022. PHI’s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2023 decreased to $234 million from $286 million in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense and storm costs. This is partially offset by distribution and transmission rate increases.Due to revenue decoupling, PHI's distribution earnings related to Pepco Maryland, DPL Maryland, Pepco District of Columbia, and ACE are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to net income as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, and other specified items. This measure is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of period over period operating results and provide an indication of Exelon’s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentation. Exelon has provided the non-GAAP financial measure as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

(7) Represents Operating and maintenance expense, excluding pension and non-pension postretirement benefits. For ComEd, reflects increased contracting costs. For PHI, reflects increased contracting costs due to timing. For Corporate, includes the following three items: 1) a decrease in Operating and maintenance expense with an offsetting decrease in other income for costs billed to Constellation for services provided by Exelon through the TSA 2) lower BSC costs that were historically allocated to Generation but are presented as part of continuing operations in Exelon’s results as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations per the accounting rules (YTD Q1 2023 includes no costs compared to one month of costs for the period prior to the separation for YTD Q1 2022), and 3) an increase in costs for the DPA related matters. (8) Reflects ongoing capital expenditures across all utilities and higher depreciation rates effective January 2023 for ComEd. For PHI, includes the regulatory asset amortization of the ACE Purchase Power Agreement termination obligation recorded in the first quarter of 2022, which is fully recoverable in Other Energy Delivery.

Adjusted earnings drivers for the third quarter 2023, as compared with the same period in 2022, were warmer than normal weather at the company's regulated electric utilities, changes in rates and pricing, and lower income taxes and non-fuel operations and maintenance costs, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization. Third-quarter 2023 operating revenues were$7.0 billion, compared with$8.4 billionfor the third quarter of 2022, a decrease of 16.7 percent. For the nine months endedSeptember 30, 2023, operating revenues were$19.2 billion, compared with$22.2 billionfor the corresponding period in 2022, a decrease of 13.6 percent. These decreases were primarily due to lower fuel costs in 2023. ""Our premier state-regulated electric and gas utilities continued to perform well during the third quarter, and Southern Power made strategic additions to its portfolio of renewable generation assets,"" said President and CEOChristopher C. Womack. ""It is also significant to note that the accelerated economic development we have seen in the Southeast over the last couple of years has contributed to a projected growth in electricity usage that is significantly larger than historic levels,"" added Womack. ""For example, Georgia Power has filed an updated Integrated Resource Plan with the Georgia Public Service Commission, proposing additional investment in our region's energy future to provide energy solutions that are expected to benefitGeorgiacustomers and communities for generations to come.""

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 BACKGROUND Overview IsoEnergy was incorporated on February 2, 2016 under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) as a wholly-owned subsidiary of NexGen Energy Ltd. (""NexGen"") to acquire certain exploration assets of NexGen. NexGen is a Canadian based uranium exploration company focused on the advancement of its Rook 1 Project in the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan. On October 19, 2016, IsoEnergy was listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (""TSXV""). NexGen's common shares are listed and posted for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange and the Australian Stock Exchange. As of the date hereof, NexGen holds 49.7% of the outstanding IsoEnergy common shares. The principal business activity of IsoEnergy is the acquisition and exploration of uranium mineral properties, principally in the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan. IsoEnergy's uranium mineral properties are summarized in Table 1 below.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 Figure 1 shows the location of the Company's properties in Saskatchewan. Figure 1 - Property Location Map 3 ISOENERGY LTD. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 OVERALL PERFORMANCE General In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company completed exploration work on its Hawk, Larocque East, Ranger, Geiger, East Rim, Evergreen, Collins Bay Extension and Trident properties in the Athabasca Basin. On July 18, 2022, the Company announced the initial independent Mineral Resource estimate (the ""Resource Estimate"") for the Hurricane uranium deposit on its 100% owned Larocque East project in the eastern Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan. SeeDiscussion of Operationsbelow for details of exploration programs completed, the Resource Estimate and future plans. As an exploration stage company, IsoEnergy does not have revenues and is expected to generate operating losses. As at September 30, 2023, the Company had cash of $6,965,713, an accumulated deficit of $65,040,993 and working capital of $13,471,339. Industry and Economic Factors that May Affect the Business The business of mining for minerals involves a high degree of risk. IsoEnergy is an exploration company and is subject to risks and challenges similar to companies in a comparable stage and industry. These risks include, but are not limited to, the challenges of securing adequate capital, exploration, development and operational risks inherent in the mining industry; changes in government policies and regulations; the ability to obtain the necessary permitting; as well as global economic and uranium price volatility; all of which are uncertain. As with other companies involved with mineral exploration, the Company is subject to cost inflation on exploration drilling activities and the Company may experience difficulty and / or delays in securing goods (including spare parts) and services from time-to-time. The underlying value of the Company's exploration and evaluation assets is dependent upon the existence and economic recovery of mineral reserves and is subject to, but not limited to, the risks and challenges identified above. Changes in future conditions could require material write-downs of the carrying value of the Company's exploration and evaluation assets. In particular, the Company does not generate revenue. As a result, IsoEnergy continues to be dependent on third party financing to continue exploration activities on the Company's properties. Accordingly, the Company's future performance will be most affected by its access to financing, whether debt, equity or other means. Access to such financing, in turn, is affected by general economic conditions, the price of uranium, exploration risks and the other factors described in the section entitledRisk Factorsincluded below. DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONS Corporate Activities in 2023 Dr. Darryl Clark was appointed as Vice President, Exploration, effective March 1, 2023. Proposed Merger with Consolidated Uranium Inc. On September 27, 2023, the Company and Consolidated Uranium Inc.(""Consolidated Uranium"")announced that they have entered into a definitive arrangement agreement for a share-for-share merger of IsoEnergy and Consolidated Uranium (the ""Arrangement Agreement""), pursuant to which IsoEnergy will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Consolidated Uranium not already held by IsoEnergy or its affiliates (the ""Consolidated Uranium Shares"") by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under theBusiness Corporations Act(Ontario) (the ""Arrangement"" or the ""Merger""). Under the terms of the Merger, Consolidated Uranium shareholders (the ""Consolidated Uranium Shareholders"") will receive 0.500 of a common share of IsoEnergy (each whole share, an ""IsoEnergy Share"") for each Consolidated Uranium Share held. 4 ISOENERGY LTD. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 The Arrangement will be effected by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement pursuant to theBusiness Corporations Act(Ontario), requiring (i) the approval of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List), and (ii) the approval of (A) 662/3% of the votes cast on the resolution (the ""Arrangement Resolution"") to approve the Arrangement by the Consolidated Uranium Shareholders; and (B) if required a simple majority of the votes cast on the Arrangement Resolution by Consolidated Uranium Shareholders, excluding Consolidated Uranium Shares held or controlled by persons described in terms (a) through (d) of Section 8.1(2) of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 -Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions, at a special meeting of the Consolidated Uranium Shareholders to be held to consider the Arrangement (the ""Consolidated Uranium Meeting""), which is expected to take place on or about November 28, 2023. Each of the directors and executive officers of Consolidated Uranium, together with Energy Fuels Inc. and Mega Uranium Ltd., representing an aggregate of approximately 24% of the issued and outstanding Consolidated Uranium Shares, have entered into voting support agreements with IsoEnergy, pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, to vote their Consolidated Uranium Shares in favour of the Arrangement Resolution at the Consolidated Uranium Meeting. The Arrangement Agreement includes customary representations and warranties for a transaction of this nature as well as customary interim period covenants regarding the operation of IsoEnergy and Consolidated Uranium's respective businesses. The Arrangement Agreement also provides for customary deal-protection measures, including a $10.8 million termination fee payable by Consolidated Uranium in certain circumstances. In addition to shareholder and court approvals, closing of the Merger is subject to applicable regulatory approvals, including, but not limited to, TSXV approval and the satisfaction of certain other closing conditions customary for transactions of this nature. Subject to the satisfaction of these conditions, IsoEnergy and Consolidated Uranium expect that the Merger will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Following completion of the Merger, the IsoEnergy Shares will continue to trade on the TSXV, subject to approval of the TSXV in respect of the IsoEnergy Shares being issued pursuant to the Arrangement. The Consolidated Uranium Shares will be de-listed from the TSXV following closing of the Merger. The Company retained an investment bank to advise on the Merger and provide a fairness opinion to the Company's Board of Directors, for which the investment bank is entitled to a fee customary for this type of transaction, contingent on closing of the Merger. Details regarding these and other terms of the Merger are set out in the Arrangement Agreement, available under the SEDAR+ profiles of IsoEnergy and Consolidated Uranium atwww.sedarplus.ca.Full details of the Merger will also be included in the Consolidated Uranium Circular which will be available under Consolidated Uranium's SEDAR+ profile. Private Placement of Subscription Receipts In connection with the Merger with Consolidated Uranium, on October 19, 2023, the Company closed a private placement of 8,134,500 subscription receipts of IsoEnergy (the ""Subscription Receipts"") at an issue price of $4.50 per Subscription Receipt for gross proceeds of $36,605,250 (the ""Offering""). Each Subscription Receipt entitles the holder thereof to receive, for no additional consideration and without further action on part of the holder thereof, on or about the date the Merger is completed, one IsoEnergy Share. The gross proceeds of the Offering are being held in escrow pending the satisfaction of the escrow release conditions, including the satisfaction of the conditions to the closing of the Merger, and certain other customary conditions. The Company expects the funds to be released from escrow in the fourth quarter of 2023, concurrently with completion of the Merger. Stock options In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company issued 797,500 common shares on the exercise of stock options for proceeds of $419,388 and granted 1,767,500 stock options with a weighted average strike price of $2.70. 5 ISOENERGY LTD. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 Investment in Latitude Uranium Inc. On April 5, 2023, the Company subscribed to 5,714,300 subscription receipts (""Latitude Subscription Receipts"") of Latitude Uranium Inc. (previously Labrador Uranium Inc. (""Latitude Uranium"") at a price of $0.35 per Latitude Subscription Receipt for total consideration of $2,000,005. On June 19, 2023, after completion of Latitude Uranium's acquisition of a 100% interest in the Angilak Uranium Project in Nunavut Territory from ValOre Metals Corp., the Latitude Subscription Receipts were exercised into one unit of Latitude Uranium, consisting of one common share of Latitude Uranium and one- half of one common share purchase warrant, exercisable at a price of $0.50 at any time on or before April 5, 2026. This investment provides IsoEnergy with initial exposure to a prospective area of interest to the Company. Mountain Lake option agreement The Company and Consolidated Uranium agreed on August 2, 2023 to extend the expiry date of Consolidated Uranium's option to acquire the Company's Mountain Lake property in Nunavut, Canada from August 3, 2023 to December 31, 2023.

Winter drilling comprised five diamond drill holes totaling 4,273 metres. The first-pass drilling was successful, intersecting graphitic conductors and prospective brittle structures in the southern half of the property. Basal sandstone intersected in HK23-03 are pervasively bleached with metre-scale zones of structure, desilicification, clay alteration, and ""grey"" sulphate related alteration which increase in strength near the unconformity. In HK23-05A, located 350 metres north, the upper and middle sandstone contain metre scale zones of fractured and fault disrupted sandstone, with the middle structure associated with desilicification, clay alteration, and bleaching. Anomalous radioactivity associated with sulphide mineralization was intersected at the unconformity of HK23-05A up to 350 counts per second (Figure 4). Radioactive intersections encountered during the 2023 winter drilling program were as follows: Hole-ID From (m) To (m) Length Radioactivity Chemical Assays Orientation Hole (m) Min-Max (Azm/Dip) Length U3O8 Ni (%) (CPS) (m) (%) HK23-05A 693.5 694.0 0.5 60-350 Pending -70 779 Winter 2023 -Ground EM Surveying The Company completed the inversion of historic ZTEM data along with an additional 36 kilometres of fixed- loop electromagnetic geophysical surveying over its Hawk property early in 2023. The ZTEM inversion highlights the extent of the conductive trend within the property and correlates well with the ground EM data 8 ISOENERGY LTD. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 that has been collected over the past two years, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 - Hawk winter ground EM survey results and the results of the 3D inversion of the historic ZTEM data from 100 metres below the unconformity with the proposed summer drill targets Summer 2023 - Ambient Noise Tomography Surveying An Ambient Noise Tomography (""ANT"") survey was completed on the south-western portion of the Hawk property, using EXOSPHERE BY FLEET®. ExoSphere technology by Fleet Space consists of laying an array of 64 lightweight, battery-powered surface sensors called Geodes over a 2 km² survey grid to measure naturally occurring environmental seismic vibrations in the ground (caused by wave action, weather, and anthropogenic activities) over a six-day period. The Geodes collect and deliver information in near real-time to Fleet Space's satellite network. The ANT survey at Hawk, conducted over 7.3 km of the main north-northeast trending ZTEM conductivity corridor, has defined a large velocity low anomaly (Figure 3) that is coincident with both the on strike projection of the altered brittle fault zone intersected in drill holes HK23-03/05A/08 and the strong conductor picks identified in the winter 2023 ground EM survey. Similar to the ANT signature that is associated with the Hurricane deposit, the velocity low is interpreted as the result of a large hydrothermal system that has altered the sandstone cover sequence above the unconformity target. 9 Attachments Disclaimer Isoenergy Ltd.published this content on02 November 2023and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

(NYSE: TRGP) (“TRGP,” the “Company” or “Targa”) today reported third quarter 2023 results. Third quarter 2023 net income attributable to Targa Resources Corp. was $220.0 million compared to $193.1 million for the third quarter of 2022. Highlights The Company reported adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other non-cash items (“adjusted EBITDA”) of $840.2 million for the third quarter of 2023 compared to $768.6 million for the third quarter of 2022. The Company reported distributable cash flow and adjusted free cash flow for the third quarter of 2023 of $602.2 million and $8.6 million, respectively. On October 12, 2023, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per common share for the third quarter of 2023, or $2.00 per common share on an annualized basis. Total cash dividends of approximately $112 million will be paid on November 15, 2023 on all outstanding shares of common stock to holders of record as of the close of business on October 31, 2023. Targa repurchased 1,583,317 shares of its common stock during the third quarter of 2023 at a weighted average per share price of $83.38 for a total net cost of $132.0 million. There was $810.7 million remaining under the Company’s $1.0 billion common share repurchase program as of September 30, 2023. Third Quarter 2023 - Sequential Quarter over Quarter Commentary Targa reported third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $840.2 million, representing a six percent increase compared to the second quarter of 2023. The sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to record NGL pipeline transportation volumes and higher LPG export volumes in Targa’s Logistics and Transportation (“L&T”) segment, higher realized commodity prices, and higher fees partially offset by higher expenses. In the Gathering and Processing (“G&P”) segment, higher sequential adjusted operating margin was attributable to higher realized commodity prices, offset by the impacts of the extended stretch of intense heat in Texas and New Mexico that impacted Targa and our customers’ operating rates during the third quarter and volumes from a lower margin high pressure gathering and processing agreement in the Delaware Basin that moved off our system. Targa’s Permian volumes are currently about 150 MMcf/d higher than the third quarter average. In the L&T segment, record NGL pipeline transportation volumes, higher LPG export volumes, and higher marketing margin drove the sequential increase in segment adjusted operating margin. Increasing NGL pipeline transportation volumes were primarily due to higher third-party supply volumes and LPG export volumes benefited from improved market conditions. Marketing margin was higher due to increased seasonal optimization opportunities. Higher operating expenses were primarily attributable to system expansions and higher maintenance expenses, while higher compensation and benefits drove the sequential increase in general and administrative expenses. Capitalization and Liquidity The Company’s total consolidated debt as of September 30, 2023 was $12,920.4 million, net of $63.9 million of debt issuance costs and $40.5 million of unamortized discount, with $9,534.4 million of outstanding senior notes, $1.5 billion outstanding under the Company’s $1.5 billion term loan facility, $1,150.0 million outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program, $560.0 million outstanding under the Securitization Facility, and $280.4 million of finance lease liabilities. Total consolidated liquidity as of September 30, 2023 was approximately $1.8 billion, including $1.6 billion available under the TRGP Revolver, $139.5 million of cash and $40.0 million available under the Securitization Facility. Growth Projects Update In early fourth quarter, Targa commenced operations at its new 275 MMcf/d Greenwood plant in Permian Midland ahead of schedule and on-budget. Construction continues on its 275 MMcf/d Greenwood II plant in Permian Midland. In Permian Delaware, construction continues on the 275 MMcf/d Wildcat II, 230 MMcf/d Roadrunner II and 275 MMcf/d Bull Moose plants. In its L&T segment, Targa completed its 1 million barrel per month LPG export expansion at Galena Park late in the third quarter. Construction continues on Targa’s 120 thousand barrel per day (“MBbl/d”) Train 9 fractionator and its 120 MBbl/d Train 10 fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Texas, and its Daytona NGL Pipeline. Targa remains on-track to complete these expansions as previously disclosed. 2023 Outlook Targa maintains its 2023 adjusted EBITDA between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion, with current expectations trending to the lower end of the range. Commodity prices are lower than the assumptions underlying Targa’s previously disclosed full year financial estimates for 2023 and while Permian Basin volumes have continued to grow, the growth has been less than initially projected given weather and operational issues and bottlenecks associated with compression additions in the Delaware Basin. Targa’s estimate for 2023 total net growth capital expenditures remains unchanged at between $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion, with current expectations trending to the higher end of the range. Targa’s estimate for 2023 net maintenance capital expenditures is now approximately $200 million. Capital Allocation Update For the first quarter of 2024, Targa intends to recommend to its Board of Directors an increase to its common dividend to $0.75 per common share or $3.00 per common share annualized. The recommended common dividend per share increase, if approved, would be effective for the first quarter of 2024 and payable in May 2024. Beyond 2024, Targa expects to be in position to continue to provide meaningful annual increases to its common dividend. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Targa has repurchased 4,395,519 shares of common stock at a weighted average per share price of $75.77 for a total net cost of $333.1 million. Targa expects to continue to be in position to opportunistically repurchase its stock going forward with approximately $810.7 million remaining under its current common share repurchase program. Consistent with previous years, Targa plans to detail its full year 2024 operational and financial outlook in February 2024 in conjunction with its fourth quarter 2023 earnings announcement. An earnings supplement presentation and an updated investor presentation are available under Events and Presentations in the Investors section of the Company’s website atwww.targaresources.com/investors/events.

(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is discussed under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Targa Resources Corp. – Consolidated Financial Results of Operations (1) Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and are discussed under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”NM Due to a low denominator, the noted percentage change is disproportionately high and as a result, considered not meaningful. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 The decrease in commodity sales reflects lower natural gas, NGL and condensate prices ($2,704.1 million), partially offset by higher NGL and natural gas volumes ($1,000.1 million) and the favorable impact of hedges ($258.5 million). The decrease in fees from midstream services is primarily due to lower gas gathering and processing fees and transportation and fractionation volumes, partially offset by higher export volumes. The decrease in product purchases and fuel reflects lower natural gas, NGL and condensate prices, partially offset by higher NGL and natural gas volumes. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher labor and maintenance costs due to increased activity and system expansions, the acquisition of certain assets in the Delaware Basin and inflation. See “—Review of Segment Performance” for additional information on a segment basis. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the acquisition of certain assets in the Delaware Basin and the impact of system expansions on the Company’s asset base, partially offset by the shortening of the depreciable lives of certain assets that were idled in 2022. The increase in general and administrative expense is primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and insurance costs. The increase in interest expense, net is due to higher net borrowings primarily for the acquisition of certain assets in the Delaware Basin and the Grand Prix Transaction, and higher interest rates, partially offset by higher capitalized interest resulting from higher growth capital investments. The increase in income tax expense is primarily due to an increase in pre-tax book income and a smaller release of the valuation allowance in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily due to the Grand Prix Transaction and lower earnings allocated to the Company’s joint venture partner in WestTX. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 The decrease in commodity sales reflects lower NGL, natural gas and condensate prices ($7,920.7 million), partially offset by higher NGL, natural gas and condensate volumes ($2,063.8 million) and the favorable impact of hedges ($1,176.2 million). The increase in fees from midstream services is primarily due to higher gas gathering and processing fees including the impact of the acquisition of certain assets in the Delaware Basin and South Texas, and higher export fees, partially offset by lower transportation and fractionation fees. The decrease in product purchases and fuel reflects lower NGL, natural gas and condensate prices, partially offset by higher NGL, natural gas and condensate volumes. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher labor and maintenance costs due to increased activity and system expansions, the acquisition of certain assets in the Delaware Basin and South Texas, and inflation. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the acquisition of certain assets in the Delaware Basin and the impact of system expansions on our asset base, partially offset by the shortening of depreciable lives of certain assets that were idled in 2022. The increase in general and administrative expense is primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, insurance costs and professional fees. During 2022, the Company terminated the previous TRGP senior secured revolving credit facility and the Partnership’s senior secured revolving credit facility. In addition, the Partnership redeemed its 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 and its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2026. These transactions resulted in a net loss from financing activities. During 2022, the Company completed the sale of Targa GCX Pipeline LLC to a third party resulting in a gain from sale of an equity method investment. The decrease in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily due to the Grand Prix Transaction and lower earnings allocated to the Company’s joint venture partner in WestTX and Venice Energy Services Company, L.L.C. The premium on repurchase of noncontrolling interests, net of tax is due to the Grand Prix Transaction in 2023 and the purchase of all of Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners’ interests in the Company’s development company joint ventures in 2022. The decrease in dividends on Series A Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”) is due to the full redemption of all of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred in May 2022. Review of Segment Performance The following discussion of segment performance includes inter-segment activities. The Company views segment operating margin and adjusted operating margin as important performance measures of the core profitability of its operations. These measures are key components of internal financial reporting and are reviewed for consistency and trend analysis. For a discussion of adjusted operating margin, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures ― Adjusted Operating Margin.” Segment operating financial results and operating statistics include the effects of intersegment transactions. These intersegment transactions have been eliminated from the consolidated presentation. The Company operates in two primary segments: (i) Gathering and Processing; and (ii) Logistics and Transportation. Gathering and Processing Segment The Gathering and Processing segment includes assets used in the gathering and/or purchase and sale of natural gas produced from oil and gas wells, removing impurities and processing this raw natural gas into merchantable natural gas by extracting NGLs; and assets used for the gathering and terminaling and/or purchase and sale of crude oil. The Gathering and Processing segment’s assets are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico (including the Midland, Central and Delaware Basins); the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; the Barnett Shale in North Texas; the Anadarko, Ardmore, and Arkoma Basins in Oklahoma (including the SCOOP and STACK) and South Central Kansas; the Williston Basin in North Dakota (including the Bakken and Three Forks plays); and the onshore and near offshore regions of the Louisiana Gulf Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. The following table provides summary data regarding results of operations of this segment for the periods indicated: (1) Segment operating statistics include the effect of intersegment amounts, which have been eliminated from the consolidated presentation. For all volume statistics presented, the numerator is the total volume sold during the period and the denominator is the number of calendar days during the period.(2) Plant natural gas inlet represents the Company’s undivided interest in the volume of natural gas passing through the meter located at the inlet of a natural gas processing plant, other than Badlands.(3) Plant natural gas inlet volumes and gross NGL production volumes include producer take-in-kind volumes, while natural gas sales and NGL sales exclude producer take-in-kind volumes.(4) Permian Midland includes operations in WestTX, of which the Company owns a 72.8% undivided interest, and other plants that are owned 100% by the Company. Operating results for the WestTX undivided interest assets are presented on a pro-rata net basis in the Company’s reported financials.(5) Includes operations from the acquisition of certain assets in the Delaware Basin for the period effective August 1, 2022.(6) Operations include facilities that are not wholly owned by the Company. SouthTX operating statistics include the impact of the acquisition of certain assets in South Texas for the period effective April 21, 2022.(7) Badlands natural gas inlet represents the total wellhead volume and includes the Targa volumes processed at the Little Missouri 4 plant.(8) Average realized prices, net of fees, include the effect of realized commodity hedge gain/loss attributable to the Company’s equity volumes. The price is calculated using total commodity sales plus the hedge gain/loss as the numerator and total sales volume as the denominator, net of fees. The following table presents the realized commodity hedge gain (loss) attributable to the Company’s equity volumes that are included in the adjusted operating margin of the Gathering and Processing segment: (1) The price spread is the differential between the contracted derivative instrument pricing and the price of the corresponding settled commodity transaction.Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 The decrease in adjusted operating margin was due to lower commodity prices, partially offset by higher natural gas inlet volumes and higher fees predominantly in the Permian. The increase in natural gas inlet volumes in the Permian was attributable to the acquisition of certain assets in the Delaware Basin during the third quarter of 2022, the addition of the Legacy I and Red Hills VI plants during the third quarter of 2022 and the Legacy II plant late in the first quarter of 2023, and continued strong producer activity. The natural gas inlet volumes in the Central region increased primarily due to increased producer activity during the third quarter of 2023. The increase in operating expenses was predominantly due to the acquisition of certain assets in the Delaware Basin. Additionally, higher volumes in the Permian, the addition of the Legacy I, Red Hills VI, Legacy II and Midway plants, and inflation impacts resulted in increased costs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 The increase in adjusted operating margin was due to higher natural gas inlet volumes and higher fees resulting in increased margin predominantly in the Permian, partially offset by lower commodity prices. Natural gas inlet volumes in the Central region increased due to the acquisition of certain assets in South Texas during the second quarter of 2022 and increased producer activity. The increase in operating expenses was predominantly due to the acquisition of certain assets in the Delaware Basin and South Texas. Logistics and Transportation Segment The Logistics and Transportation segment includes the activities and assets necessary to convert mixed NGLs into NGL products and also includes other assets and value-added services such as transporting, storing, fractionating, terminaling, and marketing of NGLs and NGL products, including services to LPG exporters and certain natural gas supply and marketing activities in support of the Company’s other businesses. The Logistics and Transportation segment also includes Grand Prix NGL Pipeline, which connects the Company’s gathering and processing positions in the Permian Basin, Southern Oklahoma and North Texas with the Company’s Downstream facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas. The associated assets are generally connected to and supplied in part by the Company’s Gathering and Processing segment and, except for the pipelines and smaller terminals, are located predominantly in Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, Texas, and in Lake Charles, Louisiana. The following table provides summary data regarding results of operations of this segment for the periods indicated: (1) Segment operating statistics include intersegment amounts, which have been eliminated from the consolidated presentation. For all volume statistics presented, the numerator is the total volume sold during the period and the denominator is the number of calendar days during the period.(2) Represents the total quantity of mixed NGLs that earn a transportation margin.(3) Export volumes represent the quantity of NGL products delivered to third-party customers at the Company’s Galena Park Marine Terminal that are destined for international markets.Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 The increase in adjusted operating margin was due to higher pipeline transportation and fractionation margin, higher LPG export margin and higher marketing margin. Pipeline transportation and fractionation volumes benefited from higher supply volumes primarily from our Permian Gathering and Processing systems and higher fees. LPG export margin increased due to higher volumes. Marketing margin increased due to greater optimization opportunities. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, and higher costs attributable to inflation. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 The increase in adjusted operating margin was due to higher pipeline transportation and fractionation margin, higher marketing margin and higher LPG export margin. LPG Export margin increased primarily due to higher volumes and lower fuel and power costs. The increase in operating expenses was due to higher compensation and benefits, taxes, repairs and maintenance, and higher costs attributable to inflation. Other Other contains the results of commodity derivative activity mark-to-market gains/losses related to derivative contracts that were not designated as cash flow hedges. The Company has entered into derivative instruments to hedge the commodity price associated with a portion of the Company’s future commodity purchases and sales and natural gas transportation basis risk within the Company’s Logistics and Transportation segment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted operating margin (segment). The following tables provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. The Company utilizes non-GAAP measures to analyze the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted operating margin (segment) are non-GAAP measures. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to these non-GAAP measures are income (loss) from operations, Net income (loss) attributable to Targa Resources Corp. and segment operating margin. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP measures and have important limitations as analytical tools. Investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because the Company’s non-GAAP measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect income and segment operating margin, and are defined differently by different companies within the Company’s industry, the Company’s definitions may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. Management compensates for the limitations of the Company’s non-GAAP measures as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into the Company’s decision-making processes. Adjusted Operating Margin The Company defines adjusted operating margin for the Company’s segments as revenues less product purchases and fuel. It is impacted by volumes and commodity prices as well as by the Company’s contract mix and commodity hedging program. Gathering and Processing adjusted operating margin consists primarily of: Logistics and Transportation adjusted operating margin consists primarily of: The adjusted operating margin impacts of mark-to-market hedge unrealized changes in fair value are reported in Other. Adjusted operating margin for the Company’s segments provides useful information to investors because it is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of the Company’s financial statements, including investors and commercial banks, to assess: Management reviews adjusted operating margin and operating margin for the Company’s segments monthly as a core internal management process. The Company believes that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating the Company’s operating results. The reconciliation of the Company’s adjusted operating margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is presented under “Review of Segment Performance.” Adjusted EBITDA The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as Net income (loss) attributable to Targa Resources Corp. before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other items that the Company believes should be adjusted consistent with the Company’s core operating performance. The adjusting items are detailed in the adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table and its footnotes. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by the Company and by external users of the Company’s financial statements such as investors, commercial banks and others to measure the ability of the Company’s assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support the Company’s indebtedness and pay dividends to the Company’s investors. Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow The Company defines distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense on debt obligations, cash tax (expense) benefit and maintenance capital expenditures (net of any reimbursements of project costs). The Company defines adjusted free cash flow as distributable cash flow less growth capital expenditures, net of contributions from noncontrolling interest and net contributions to investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Distributable cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are performance measures used by the Company and by external users of the Company’s financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess the Company’s ability to generate cash earnings (after servicing the Company’s debt and funding capital expenditures) to be used for corporate purposes, such as payment of dividends, retirement of debt or redemption of other financing arrangements. The following table presents a reconciliation of Net income (loss) attributable to Targa Resources Corp. to adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and adjusted free cash flow for the periods indicated: (1) Gains or losses on debt repurchases or early debt extinguishments.(2) Includes financial advisory, legal and other professional fees, and other one-time transaction costs.(3) Noncontrolling interest portion of depreciation and amortization expense.(4) Litigation expense includes charges related to litigation resulting from the major winter storm in February 2021 that the Company considers outside the ordinary course of its business and/or not reflective of its ongoing core operations. The Company may incur such charges from time to time, and the Company believes it is useful to exclude such charges because it does not consider them reflective of its ongoing core operations and because of the generally singular nature of the claims underlying such litigation.(5) Excludes amortization of debt issuance costs.(6) Represents capital expenditures, net of contributions from noncontrolling interests and includes net contributions to investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The following table presents a reconciliation of estimated net income of the Company to estimated adjusted EBITDA for 2023: (1) Other includes litigation charges related to litigation resulting from the major winter storm in February 2021 that the Company considers outside the ordinary course of its business and/or not reflective of its ongoing core operations. The Company may incur such charges from time to time, and the Company believes it is useful to exclude such charges because it does not consider them reflective of its ongoing core operations and because of the generally singular nature of the claims underlying such litigation.(2) Noncontrolling interest portion of depreciation and amortization expense.

Much of her work focuses on alleviating water insecurity.MacArthur Foundationhide caption Anthropologist Amber Wutich embeds in communities only at their invitation — a method she calls 'participant observation.' Much of her work focuses on alleviating water insecurity. Newly minted MacArthur FellowAmber Wutichsays anthropology has historically had an ""Indiana Jones problem."" ""We have a history and even a contemporary problem of people coming into communities in a way that's not respectful, that's extractive,"" she says. Instead, Wutich takes what she describes as a ""justice oriented"" approach to research, where she is invited by people living in troubled communities to come in, observe, and help solve the problems they are facing. For most of her career, the problem she has been trying to help solve is water insecurity. ""Water insecurity is an outcome of human manufactured systems. It can occur anywhere,"" she says. ""Most people reading this piece probably have neighbors in their own backyards experiencing water insecurity. And about half the world will be in water stress conditions by 2030."" Wutich is being recognized for her groundbreaking research showing how social structures, such as water sharing among neighbors and delivery via trucks, are used as a substitute for infrastructure in water limited communities and how a lack of water impacts people's mental health in those communities. She's conducted research in over a dozen countries, including Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay. She also is co-founder and co-director of theGlobal Ethnohydrology Studyand director of theAction for Water Equity Consortium, which develops water access infrastructure for communities on the U.S.-Mexico border. NPR spoke to Wutich about what it felt like to win the so-called ""genius grant,"" how water insecurity affects communities and her experiences traveling the world to do research. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Congratulations on being named a MacArthur ""genius"" award winner, Amber! How do you feel? Do you think of yourself as a genius? It's very shocking and very humbling. When you get the call, you're only allowed to call one other person and tell them the news. And so I chose my doctoral mentorRuss Bernard, whom I've been working with for 30 years. He said, ""my first advice to you is to never refer to yourself as a genius."" So I will have to tell you in the most robust and sincere way possible that I would never refer to myself as a genius. How did you become interested in the topic of water insecurity? I'm from Miramar, Florida [near Miami] and like everyone in south Florida I grew up with hurricanes. So I can remember Hurricane Andrew when our electricity and our clean water service got knocked out. We depended fundamentally on our neighbors to survive. And so I think that experience really oriented me to understanding how social networks and cultural norms form the backbone of human response to crises. And then I just started working on water because it's the most important thing to humans and I wanted to be of use. Is water insecurity something that you've experienced yourself? Can you describe what that's like? Oh, I've definitely experienced quite a bit of water insecurity. As an anthropologist, our main method isparticipant observation, which means that we live with people experiencing the phenomenon we're studying and we embed in their lives. So I spent years living in informal communities that have no water access. Imagine you went camping for the weekend and you took some bottles of water with you and maybe there was the river there but it wasn't safe to drink the water and there's no toilet. You are scrambling to find money to buy more bottles of water but they're not sold anywhere nearby. You drink the water and it makes you sick. You've got to go to work but you have no place to shower and there's human waste piling up that you need to figure out how to dispose of. Just imagine that's your daily life and how challenging and stressful it would be. When I think about standout moments for myself, they're usually terrible moments of me making mistakes around water or toilets, me realizing I've made a social faux pas and can only access water from this place and not that place or desperately trying to find a water vendor to sell me enough water to get to the next day. Much of your work over the past couple of decades has been in the city of Cochabamba, Bolivia. What led you to begin working in that community? Cochabamba is the place where the water war happened. In 2000, the Cochabamba government tried to privatize all of its water resources [leading to increased prices for water and access for only industry and middle class neighborhoods] and people rose up in protest against this. People were protesting in the streets and there was some violent response from the government. So the protesters in the city actually won the water war and everything reverted back to the way it had been before, which meant that people living in 50% of the city [still] did not have water service. And so that was when communities started to ask to work with me. So you were invited to live in this community to observe and experience the conditions there for yourself. What was that like? My first extended fieldwork in Cochabamba, Bolivia was for nearly two years, renting a room in a small house that has limited services and infrastructure. And in that time, we learned everything from how to live on 10 liters [2.5 gallons] of water a day, how to use a toilet that doesn't flush and how we have to interact with our neighbors when our lives depend on them providing us with water. It takes months even to gain the most basic competence in how to live day to day. And that's led you to documenting how social structures replace water infrastructure in these communities. Can you give us an example of what those social structures are? One example was a woman named Sophia, who lived at the far outskirts of the community that I was living in. Her family regularly ran out of water [there was no piped water supply] and she explained to me how she navigated her social network to use combinations of barter and favors and long-term friendships and monetary exchanges to ensure that her two young daughters had enough water to have food and drink on a day-to-day basis. How do you conduct research in Cochabamba and the other communities you've been to in an ethical way? Are you trying to improve water access for people while you're there? The very first and most important thing is going into communities in a way that respects the community's needs and desires for the field work and ensures that our work is welcomed. There are two guiding principles that my team's always tried to adhere to. One is ""failure is not an option,"" because people's survival depends on water. That means we have to find ways to support and organize systems to provide water. But also the communities have to be able to say no – we can't force new systems onto people if they don't consent. So that's really the heart of the way that we approach these research partnerships. You've made major commitments and personal sacrifices to study and help improve water access all over the world. When you're not hard at work, what do you do to relax? I spend the rest of my time with my family really having wonderful experiences. And as I mentioned, they've always come with me on my fieldwork, and we've had many adventures, which my children call mishaps, and I find all of that quite fulfilling. They're 14 and 9 and they definitely have their complaints. Is there anything that those of us who aren't dealing with water insecurity can do in our own lives to help make things easier for those that are? Even if we don't perceive it, we are all dealing with it because we're collectively creating the social structures that are producing water insecurity for everyone, even if it's not hitting our household or our community just yet. So being cognizant of that, and trying in whatever way feels right to people to construct communities and networks that can help us weather these challenges."

Russia has doubled down on a campaign to capture the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka during the 88th week ofits warin what appears to be a repeat of its year-long campaign to capture nearby Bakhmut, which fell in May. As inBakhmut, the Russian tactics have consisted of waves of infantry attacks that Ukrainian commanders said would soon become denser, and as in Bakhmut, Russian forces were suffering large losses of men and equipment. The Russian military is mounting efforts to retake the initiative in other places on the eastern front as well. The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces,Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Russia has “significantly strengthened” its forces in Bakhmut and switched from defence to offence. Ukrainian forces have had the Russians in retreat there in recent months as they tried to encircle the captured town. They retook commanding heights north of Bakhmut in July, from which they’ve been shelling Russian positions. During the past week, they advanced past a railway line that runs 10km (6.2 miles) southwest of Bakhmut, meaning Russian forces can’t use it to resupply their front lines. Russian forces tried to advance from several directions towards Kupiansk in the Luhansk region, Syrskyi said. Ukrainian southern forces spokesman Oleksandr Shtupun estimated on Thursday that 5,000 Russians had been killed or wounded two weeks into the effort to capture Avdiivka and Moscow had lost about 400armoured vehiclesthere and in Mariinka, farther south along the eastern front. That high rate of attrition continued in the past week, according to Ukraine. Its armed forces reported 660 Russians killed on Saturday across the front in 70 combat clashes, 10 of them in Avdiivka. Two days later, they said they killed 680 Russian soldiers. Shtupun said 500 of those casualties were in the Avdiivka area over 30 assaults. Russia is apparently able to replenish its numbers. The commander of the Russian “Arbat” Separate Guards Special Purpose Battalion, which is serving in Avdiivka, told a Russian reporter that fighters from theWagner mercenary groupare now among its ranks, an observation backed by a Ukrainian source. Wagner fighters were largely responsible for the capture of Bakhmut but were taken off the front lines because of military disagreements between the late Wagner boss,Yevgeny Prigozhin, and the Russian Ministry of Defence. Their recruitment is likely to strengthen the quality of Russian forces. Russian National Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev said nearly 385,000 people entered service with the Russian armed forces this year. There may be worse to come. Shtupun said Russia was training Storm-Z assault troops to deploy in Avdiivka. Storm-Z soldiers are recruited in prisons and are thought to receive only rudimentary training and equipment but are believed to be ruthless in close-quarters combat. Ukrainians refer to such waves of infantry with poor mechanised and air support as “meat assaults”. Retired Ukrainian Colonel Petro Chernyk said Russia could potentially call on up to 3 million former conscripts trained in basic combat and, despite the fact that Ukraine has “destroyed” about 25,000 Russian soldiers a month, these were always immediately replaced. “The enemy should not be underestimated strategically. They have an extremely large number of small arms in their warehouses, and the last battles for Avdiivka and Bakhmut showed that they will use large infantry [columns]. Therefore, any information that Russia is currently running out of mobilisation resources is absolute nonsense,” Ukraine’s armed forces website Armyinform quoted Chernyk as saying. Both sides appeared to be scraping the bottom of the barrelfor ordnance. The Bloomberg news agency quoted unnamed sources as saying that the European Union had supplied only a third of the one million shells it has promised Ukraine by April. While Ukraine’s allies made new pledges of hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment in the past week, it appeared that not all were immediately deliverable. The New York Times reported that the US military was looking into marrying Soviet-era air defence launchers with modern Western missiles that are accurate and effective. These so-called FrankenSAM hybrid systems are an effort to make use of readily available components to enrich Ukraine’s air defences. In the same spirit, Russia was reportedly upgrading its gliding bombs – the FAB-250, FAB-500 and FAB-1500 – to use laser guidance, which improved their accuracy from 50 metres (55 yards) to 5 metres (5.5 yards). The smallest of these bombs reportedly carries 99kg (218lb) of explosives and has a damage radius of 120 metres (130 yards) while the largest packs 675kg (1,500lb) of explosives and has a blast radius of half a kilometre (a third of a mile). Gliding bombs are generally cheaper and easier to produce than other highly accurate systems, such as missiles or drones. Ukraine prides itself on having contained Russia’sBlack Sea Fleet, allowing grain ships to continue using a safe corridor along its coastline to the territorial waters of NATO members Romania and Bulgaria. The Reuters news agency reported on Thursday that Ukraine had suspended that corridor because of a threat from Russian warplanes. Ukraine’s reconstruction minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, denied there had been a suspension. The US ambassador to Kyiv, Bridget Brink, appeared to reinforce Ukraine’s denial, saying 53 ships had passed safely through the corridor in September, delivering 2 million tonnes of grain. Russia pulled out of a deal to allow Ukraine’s grain ships to cross the Black Sea in July after Ukraine attacked the KerchBridge to Crimeafor a second time. Russia threatened to prevent ships from loading at Ukrainian ports, but Ukraine has since managed to keep the Russian fleet at bay. Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Police in Clearwater, which is on Florida's Gulf Coast near Tampa, said in a social media post that no injuries were reported when two possible tornadoes touched down around 2 a.m. Thursday. Photos shared by the agency showed gutters from a home that pierced the windshield of a car. ”We were very fortunate,” Jevon Graham, the Clearwater Fire and Rescue division chief for emergency management, told the Tampa Bay Times. “Nobody lost their life which is great, but there is considerable damage to some of the houses.” The winds toppled trees and blew portions of roofs off some mobile homes and businesses in Pinellas County before moving north. In Citrus County, officials canceled public school classes for the day. “The west side of Citrus County has experienced significant damage from an unconfirmed tornado(s) which hit the area overnight,” school officials said in a Facebook post shortly after 6 a.m. Deputies were directing traffic Thursday morning due to multiple road closures caused by the storm, the Citrus County Sheriff's Office said on social media. A portion of U.S Highway 19, which is a major thoroughfare through the mostly rural county, was closed due to storm damage. Photos posted by the sheriff's office showed debris on roads, local flooding and damage to mobile homes. The damage wasn't limited to the Gulf Coast side of Florida. The Flagler County Sheriff’s Office said a tornado was reported Thursday morning in a section of Palm Coast, which is some 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of Jacksonville, on the state's Atlantic Coast. There were no injuries reported, “however, there is some significant damage in the area,” the sheriff’s office said on social media without providing additional details. “Please use caution in the area,” the Flagler Sheriff's Office said. Later in the day, the National Weather Service confirmed that a tornado had touched down in Palm Coast, destroying the roof of a home, flipping a minivan on its side and destroying several screened porches, fences and sheds. Some tornado watches remained in effect Thursday morning across parts of central and north Florida."

Strong winds smashed windows, moved cars and leftone person injured.You might associate tornadoes with the plains of the central US, but they're surprisingly common in the UK too—albeit smaller and weaker. In fact, my former Ph.D. student Kelsey Mulder found that the UK has about 2.3 tornadoes per year per 10,000 square kilometers. That's a higher density than the US, which as a whole has just 1.3 per 10,000 square km.The numbers are higher for American states in ""Tornado Alley"" such as Oklahoma (3.6) or Kansas (11.2). Nonetheless, a random location in the UK is more likely to experience a tornado than a random location in the US.The data isn't perfect, however. Tornadoes cannot be observed by satellites and need to be close to weather radars, which can detect the rotation. Thus, most observations are made by humans who then have to report them to the relevant weather service. ""Storm-chasers"" follow most tornadoes on the American plains, but underreporting may be an issue elsewhere.Most tornado research has focused on the US, where forecasting and early-warning systems are advanced. There is considerably less research on UK tornadoes. Over the past 12 years, my research group has tried to address this by shedding light onwhere and when UK tornadoes occur, what causes thestorms that produce themand how we canbetter predict them.England has three 'tornado alleys'Whereas many tornadoes in the US plains occur within a few weeks during the spring, UK tornadoes can occur throughout the year. The UK'stornado alleyis really three regions, most in southern England: an area south of a line between Reading and London with a maximum near Guildford, locations southwest of Ipswich and a line west and south of Birmingham.These regions have probabilities of experiencing a tornado within a 100 square km area of somewhere between 3% and 6% per year, meaning they could see one as often as every 15 to 30 years.These tornadoes aren't as violent as the more extreme ones in the US, but the damage can still be substantial. In July 2005, a large tornado in Birmingham caused £40 million in damages andinjured 39. Fortunately, no one was killed. People have died in the past though, for example a strong tornado in South Wales in 1913killed three.Although the Birmingham tornado was the most damaging tornado on that day, two others were recorded across the British Isles. Indeed, around 70% of UK tornado days have at least two reports, and 13% produce three or more.We refer to such days astornado outbreaks, with the largest-ever UK tornado outbreak occurring on 23 November 1981, producing104 tornado reportsfrom Anglesey to Norwich.What causes tornadoesWe still don't know exactly why the UK has so many weak tornadoes. We do know that ""supercells""—rotating thunderstorms tens of kilometers across—form the largest tornadoes in the US but occur less frequently in the UK. Instead, tornadoes in the UK tend to be formed from lines of storms along cold fronts.Credit: AI-generated imageAlthough millions of dollars have been spent researching supercell thunderstorms in the US, there is anincreasing awarenessthat these linear storms also require investigation on both sides of the Atlantic. Our group has been trying to understand what causes some of these parent storms to begin to rotate and eventually spawn tornadoes.So far, my former Ph.D. student Ty Buckingham and I have been able to identify certain conditions where the wind direction changes abruptly. In such cases, an instability may develop where small perturbations grow intorotating vortices a kilometer or more across, regularly spaced along the front. Such vortices are thought to be the precursor for tornadoes.Identifying the conditions for this so-called ""horizontal shearing instability"" should mean we can better predict when and where the parent storms that produce the tornadoes form. But understanding this instability is not the only answer. Other tornado-producing storms do not appear to be associated with this instability, so we still have more to learn.The next step is understanding how the tornadoes themselves form. For that, we will need both fortuitous observations of such tornadoes forming close to Met Office radars and powerful computer programs that are able to model the atmosphere down to a scale of tens of meters.Recent advances in computing and our collaborations with colleagues in engineering may yet reveal the secrets of UKtornadoes.Journal information:Monthly Weather Review"

<li>In 1889, journalist Nellie Bly set off on a trip around the world, trying to make it under 80 days.</li>
<li>Shortly after, … [+16124 chars]",Singapore,"On November 14, 1889, Nellie Bly boarded a steamship for London, planning to return to New Jersey 75 days later, beating the record set by the fictitious protagonist of Jules Verne's ""Around the World in 80 Days"" with time to spare. A few hours later, Elizabeth Bisland stepped on a train in New York, bound west for California. In a wild scramble, her editors at Cosmopolitan magazine decided to have her circumnavigate the globe in the opposite direction in an attempt to beat Bly. The two women were very different. Bly was a daredevil reporter perhaps best known for exposing the horrific conditions of an asylum on Blackwell's Island, and Bisland was a literary critic and poet. But both were in their mid-20s and had made their way to live and work in New York on the strength of their writing. Traveling such a far distance in only a few months would have been impossible only a few decades earlier. For women to make the journey, and by themselves, was also unusual. ""I do like thinking that they help flip the dial of what women could do at the time,"" Adrien Behn told Insider. She created ""A Race Around the World: Based on the True Adventures of Nellie Bly and Elizabeth Bisland,"" a new podcast about the two women's race. Through a combination of trains and steamships and with the assistance of some well-timed telegrams and a lot of luck, the two finished their race within days of each other. These technologies were still developing at a rapid clip. ""These women were not only racing around the world; they were racing through the heart of the Victorian age,"" Matthew Goodman, author of ""Eighty Days: Nellie Bly and Elizabeth Bisland's History-Making Race Around the World,"" told Insider. The first leg of Bly's trip was aboard the ""Augusta Victoria,"" a brand-new ship with stained glass, shuffleboard games, and starlit concerts. Though she was crossing from New York to London at the end of theAtlantic hurricane season, sea travel could still be dangerous. Everything from icebergs to collisions with other vessels to shipboard fires presented risks. For Bly and Bisland, seasickness proved the biggest hazard. The ship's captain recommended Bly keep eating until the nausea passed. It didn't work. ""She takes a bite, and she runs over to the deck and keeps vomiting,"" Behn said. Other 19th-century seasickness ""cures"" includedchampagne, oysters, and chloroform. Traveling by train had the trappings of luxury. On her first day, Bisland boarded a swanky sleeper car on the Fast Western Express from New York to Chicago. A first-class passenger could expect opulent decor, access to a shared washroom, and smoking and library cars. Years later, all that Bislandcould recallwas the ""coffin-like smell."" Such a journey — from New York to Chicago to Omaha to Utah to San Francisco — took Bisland on thetransatlantic route. Just 20 years earlier, the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific railroads were joined for thefirst timenorth of the Great Salt Lake. Before rail travel, it took about six months to cross the country. Trackscrisscrossedthe East and Midwest, but it took a gargantuan effort to help open the West. Between Nebraska and Sacramento, California, lay the Sierra Nevada mountains and the Rockies. ""The women were riding on these railroads that had been laid down by almost slave laborers who were facing extreme prejudice and discrimination in the course of doing it,"" Goodman said. Railroad bosses gave the most dangerous jobs to Chinese workers. They lit the fuse that exploded the black powder, tunneling through mountains. Over 1,000 Chinese workersdied duringconstruction. In 1882, the US passed theChinese Exclusion Act, which barred many Chinese immigrants from entering the country. As the railway joined the two coasts, it cleavedvast numbersofbisoninto separate herds. Easy access to the huge animals nearly led to their extinction. Huntersshot themfrom trains and left carcasses to rot. The devastation of the bison also impacted many Indigenous people who depended on the animals for survival and who now had railroad tracksrunning throughtheir lands. Just a few years before Bly's and Bisland's trips, the USran ondozens of different local times. It might be noon in Washington, DC, but 12:08 in Philadelphia. With different railroad companies coordinating trains on the same tracks based on different clocks, collisions could easily happen. In 1883,the companiesadopted Standard Railway Time. Widespread use of time zones soon followed. ""That was another indication of the remarkable transformative power of the railroad companies in that period,"" Goodman said. Even once the trains were all running on standard time, rail travel could still be dangerous. ""There were men who were specifically hired to work close to railroads just in case the train tipped over, and they would have to do emergency surgery,"" Behn said. Railway surgeons would treat passengers and crew for everyday illnesses when they were far from home. And in the case of not-infrequent accidents, they also set broken bones,amputated crushed limbs, and tended to scalded flesh. ""Unfortunately the mechanical devices for the transportation of human freight come to grief and a calamity as terrible as a battle,"" one chief surgeonwrote in 1904. Before 1869, there was no direct sea route between Europe and Asia. Ships had to sail all the wayaround southern Africa. It tookan estimated1.5 million builders and 10 yearsto connectthe Red Sea and the Mediterranean. Many Egyptians were forced into service and poorly paid. Cholera and other diseases killed thousands, though the death tollestimatesvary widely. The Suez Canal's opening shaved 4,500 miles offthe voyagebetween Britain and India. ""That alone really does crack the world open in a sense,"" Behn said. Bly arrived at Port Said, Egypt, on November 27, 1889 and traveled southward toward Yemen. In early January 1890, Bisland sailed the opposite way through the canal, entering near Yemen. Both women had plenty of time to take in the buildings, encampments, and camels. Ships in the Suez Canal traveled slow enough that Bly couldexchange pleasantrieswith passengers on other vessels. ""If ships went through faster than that, the waves would stir up the dirt and erode the banks of the canal,"" Goodman said. Thecanal's speed limitis still between 7.6 knots and 8.6 knots, just under 10 miles per hour. Here, as in other countries the two women visited, accounts of their journeys include stereotypical and offensive descriptions of the native people they saw and interacted with. With commonwealths, countries, and colonies on six continents, Britain's reach was inescapable during Bly's and Bisland's race. ""They were traveling through the length and breadth of the British Empire,"" Goodman said, stopping in its ports all along the way. Aden, Colombo, Penang, and Hong Kong were all under British control. ""As I traveled on and realized more than ever before how the English have stolen almost all, if not all, desirable sea ports,"" Bly wrote, she no longer marveled at ""the pride with which Englishmen view their flag floating in so many different climes and over so many different nationalities."" Bisland, too, noted war ships guarded Aden, which was ""valuable; and therefore, like Hong Kong, Singapore, Penang, Ceylon — like everything much worth having in this part of the world — it is an English possession."" British citizens could travel halfway around the world and still speak English, eat British food, read London newspapers, and stay in European hotels, Goodman said. ""That was a sort of imperial privilege,"" he said. ""You can go halfway around the world and in a sense almost never feel like you're leaving home."" Even in ports the British didn't control, like Yokohama, the women still saw the empire's ships, as well as vessels from France, Germany, and America. ""Colonialism seeps through the entire story"" of their travels, Behn said. In the third week of December 1889, the women were both in the South China Sea. Bly was headed to Hong Kong, while Bisland was traveling to Singapore. A week later,a Nevada newspaper read: ""The influenza is coming around the world in a good deal faster time than Nellie Bly or her rival will make."" Train and sea travel helpedrapidly spreadthe pandemic from the Russian Empire to Europe, the US, and beyond. Modern researchers have suggested the disease may actually have been a coronavirus instead of influenza. Bly had only a couple of days to prepare for her trip. Bisland left the same day her editor decided to send her. Even if they'd had time to get vaccines, there weren't a lot to choose from. Medical professionals had been using the smallpox vaccine for over 100 years. In the 1860s, anew techniqueemployed cowpox lesions instead of taking pus or scabs from an infected person and introducing it into a healthy person's bloodstream. (People in the Middle East and Africahad usedsimilar techniques for centuries.) None of the fourother vaccines— for rabies, typhoid, cholera, and plague —were widespreadbefore the 20th century. This was also decades before antibiotics. ""There's no penicillin,"" Behn said. ""Hopefully some of those doctor surgeons are nearby in case anything goes wrong."" Bly and Bisland voyaged via first-class accommodations whenever possible. Nowhere was the difference more stark than the steamships, where asingle mealmight include soup, fish, beef, duck, potatoes, salad, pastry, cheese, and fruit. Below the more sumptuous accommodations, hundreds of steerage passengers were crammed in airless rooms with unwashed dishes and clothes, and pools of vomit. First-class rooms were further from the ceaseless vibration of the engines that stokers, or coal shovelers, worked furiously to power. ""You see a huge emphasis being placed on building ships that were ever faster than the previous generation of ships,"" Goodman said. Many passengers enjoyed the idea of being on the ""fastest"" ship. And Bly had a race to win. She'd only recently learned that she wasn't just competing against time. A steamship company employee had shocked her with the news that Bisland was in the race, too. On the journey between Hong Kong and San Francisco in late December, Bly urged the ship captain to go faster. ""If I fail, I will never return to New York,"" she said. ""The only way that that could happen is because you had these men down in the bowels of the ship shoveling coal in the most abject working conditions imaginable,"" Goodman said. The stokers shoveled up 2 tons of coal a day in rooms that could reach 130 degrees Fahrenheit, Goodman said. Their shovels could get hot enough to blister their hands. Inhaling coal dust led topneumoconiosis, also known as black lung disease. One doctordescribedcoal miners' and stokers' lungs during autopsies. They were leathery and coated in thick black mucus. Queen Victoria sent President James Buchanan atelegramon August 16, 1858. It celebrated the newtransatlantic cablejoining Europe and North America. People could send messages between the continents more quickly than ever before. There were kinks in the system. New advances in the 1870s meant the cables could finally transmit more than one message at a time. Adding more cables helped lower the price of sending a telegram, too, to about 31 cents in the US. By 1889, a messagecould travelthe transatlantic cables in about five minutes. Itwasn't until1902 that cables stretched all the way around the world. Still, Bly and Bisland managed to dash off quick notes to their editors from various ports. ""The cables were actually few and far between,"" Behn said, much to Joseph Pulitzer's chagrin. The owner of The World, the paper Bly worked for, hoped to entice readers to follow her adventures. Instead, the editors cooked up a contest. The person who came closest to guessing Bly's return time would win a trip to Europe. Naturally, entrants had to fill out a slip available in each Sunday's edition — ""the more expensive paper,"" Behn said. When Bly arrived in San Francisco on January 21, 1890, she had another unwelcome surprise. A massive snowstorm had delayed the train she was supposed to take back east. Instead, her editors spent thousands of dollars to get Bly her own private train that would take a route avoiding the bad weather. Once aboard the train, Bly began to receive telegrams from her editors and well-wishers. ""Sometimes it literally literally just says, 'Nelly Bly's train,'"" Behn said. Jules Verne, whom Bly met in France during her trek, sent her a congratulatory telegram. There were a few times when communications technology more reliable and accessible than the telegraph would have helped the travelers. A man who said he was from the Thomas Cook & Son travel agency approached Bisland as she disembarked from a train in Italy on January 16, 1890. The boat she'd been hoping would wait for her had sailed, he said. ""It's not like she can send her boss a quick email,"" Behn said. Instead of sailing home from France, Bisland had to make her way to London then Ireland. And, it turned out, the man had been wrong. The ship was waiting for Bisland, who never showed. ""The cause of this false information was never satisfactorily ascertained,"" she later wrote. As Bly's train raced through the US, thousands of people gathered at different stops to cheer her on. On January 25, 1890, she reached New Jersey after 72 days, 6 hours, 11 minutes, and 14 seconds of travel. She had handily beat Verne's fictional Fogg. After a storm-tossed voyage across the Atlantic, Bisland arrived home on January 30, having completed a 76-day journey around the globe. She was greeted with much less fanfare. For a while, Bly was perhaps the most famous woman in the United States, Goodman said. Companies started slapping her name on products. ""Just put her name on anything and people will buy it,"" Behn said. ""So horse feed and games and a whole slew of items are named after Nelly."" After a brief speaking tour, the backlash against Bly began. ""She was embarking on a nationwide lecture tour and presuming to speak uninterrupted for an hour,"" Goodman said. ""I think that's when the public began to turn on her."" ""Nellie Bly is not a success as a lecturer,"" one newspaper reporter wrote. ""If she wishes to marry, however, this might be considered a recommendation."" Bisland, meanwhile, seemed happier off the front page. She continued writing and returned to Japan, China, Singapore, and other countries she'd visited on her first tour. For Behn, what Bly and Bisland did remains incredible and deserve to be remembered as much as Verne's story. ""Two people actually did it,"" she said. ""Two women actually did it."""

More than 113 million displacements of children will occur in the next three decades, estimated the UNICEF report released Friday, which took into account risks from flooding rivers, cyclonic winds and floods that follow a storm. Some children, like 10-year-old Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim, are already on the move. Her family left their home in Somalia after dawn prayers on a Saturday morning five months ago. The worst drought in more than 50 years scorched the once-fertile pastures the family relied on, leaving them barren. So, bundling only a few clothes and some utensils into sacks, they moved to a camp in the capital Mogadishu, where Ibrahim, who dreams of being a doctor, is now going to school for the first time. That’s a plus, but the camp lacks proper shelter and sanitation, and food is scarce. “We need something that can protect us from the heat during the day and the cold at night,” Ibrahim said. The miseries of long, drawn-out disasters like droughts are often underreported. Children had to leave their homes at least 1.3 million times because of drought in the years covered by the report — more than half of them in Somalia — but this is likely an undercount, the report said. Unlike during floods or storms, there are no pre-emptive evacuations during a drought. Worldwide, climate change has already left millions homeless. Rising seas are eating away at coastlines; storms are battering megacities and drought is exacerbating conflict. But while catastrophes intensify, the world has yet to recognize climate migrants and find formal ways of protecting them. “The reality is that far more children are going to be impacted in (the) future, as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify,” said Laura Healy, a migration specialist at UNICEF and one of the report's authors. Nearly a third, or 43 million of the 134 million times that people were uprooted from their homes due to extreme weather from 2016-21 included children. Nearly half were forced from their homes by storms. Of those, nearly 4 of the 10 displacements were in the Philippines. Floods displaced children more than 19 million times in places like India and China. Wildfires impacted children 810,000 times in the U.S. and Canada. Data tracking migrations because of weather extremes typically don't differentiate between children and adults. UNICEF worked with a Geneva-based nonprofit, the International Displacement Monitoring Center, to map where kids were most impacted. The Philippines, India and China had the most child displacement by climate hazards, accounting for nearly half. Those countries also have vast populations and strong systems to evacuate people, which makes it easier for them to record data. But, on average, children living in the Horn of Africa or on a small island in the Caribbean are more vulnerable. Many are enduring “overlapping crises” — where risks from climate extremes are compounded by conflict, fragile institutions and poverty, Healy said. Leaving home subjects children to extra risks. During unprecedented flooding of the Yamuna River in July in the Indian capital New Delhi, churning waters washed away the hut that was home to 10-year-old Garima Kumar’s family. The waters also took her school uniform and her school books. Kumar lived with her family on sidewalks of the megacity and missed a month of school. “Other students in the school teased me because my house had been flooded. Because we don’t have a permanent home,” Kumar said. The floodwaters have receded and the family began repairing their home last month — a process Garima’s mother Meera Devi said they are having to do over and over again as floods are becoming more common. Her father, Shiv Kumar, hasn’t had any work for over a month. The family's only income is the mother’s $2 daily earnings as a domestic helper. Children are more vulnerable because they are dependent on adults. This puts them at the risk of being exploited and not having protections, said Mimi Vu, a Vietnam-based expert on human trafficking and migration issues who wasn’t involved with the report. “When you’re desperate, you do things that you normally wouldn’t do. And unfortunately, children often bear the brunt of that because they are the most vulnerable and they don’t have the ability to stand up for themselves,” she said. Vietnam, along with countries like India and Bangladesh, will likely have many children uprooted from their homes in the future, and policymakers and the private sector need to ensure that climate and energy planning takes into account risks to children from extreme weather, the UNICEF report said. In estimating future risks, the report did not include wildfires and drought, or potential mitigation measures. It said vital services like education and health care need to become “shock-responsive, portable and inclusive,” to help children and their families better cope with disasters. This would mean considering children’s needs at different stages, from ensuring they have opportunities to study, that they can stay with their families and that eventually they can find work. “We have the tools. We have the knowledge. But we’re just not working fast enough,” Healy said. ___ Ghosal reported from Hanoi, Vietnam, Fassett reported from Seattle.

According to the analysis, China and the Philippines are among the countries that recorded the highest absolute numbers of child displacements, due to their exposure to extreme weather, large child populations and progress made on early warning and evacuation capacities. However, relative to the size of the child population, children living in small island states, such as Dominica and Vanuatu, were most affected by storms , while children in Somalia and South Sudan were most affected by floods . Floods and storms accounted for 40.9 million, or 95 per cent, of recorded child displacements between 2016 and 2021. Meanwhile, droughts triggered more than 1.3 million internal displacements of children - with Somalia again among the most affected, while wildfires triggered 810,000 child displacements, with more than a third occurring in 2020 alone. Canada, Israel and the US recorded the most. The report also said that riverine floods have the potential to displace almost 96 million children over the next 30 years, based on current climate data, while cyclonic winds and storm surges have the potential to displace 10.3 million and 7.2 million children respectively, over the same period. ""It is terrifying for any child when a ferocious wildfire, storm or flood barrels into their community,"" said Unicef Executive Director Catherine Russell. ""For those who are forced to flee, the fear and impact can be especially devastating, with worry of whether they will return home, resume school, or be forced to move again."" "

And more… — India ranked111th out of 125 countriesin the Global Hunger Index 2023, a standing the government termed “erroneous and having malafide intent”. — In the index released, India has a score of 28.7, indicating a serious level of hunger. The country came after neighbouring countries Pakistan (102nd), Bangladesh (81st), Nepal (69th) and Sri Lanka (60th). —The Global Hunger Report 2023 released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, Non-Government Organisations from Ireland and Germany respectively. — However, India fared better than South Asia and Africa South of the Sahara, which recorded a score of 27 each. — While the rate of undernourishment in India stood at 16.6 percent and under-five mortality at 3.1 percent, the prevalence of anaemia in women aged between 15 and 24 years stood at 58.1 percent. — As per the index, India also has the highest child wasting rate in the world at 18.7 percent, reflecting acute undernutrition. Wasting is measured based on children’s weight relative to their height. — In this report, “hunger” refers to the index based on the four component indicators (undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality). Taken together, the component indicators reflect deficiencies in calories as well as in micronutrients. What is the government’s stand? — The government, however, rejected the index calling it a flawed measure of “hunger” that does not reflect India’s true position. — The Women and Child Development Ministry said the index suffers from “serious methodological issues and shows a malafide intent”. “The index is an erroneous measure of hunger and suffers from serious methodological issues. Three out of the four indicators used for calculation of the index are related to the health of children and cannot be representative of the entire population. The fourth and most important indicator ‘Proportion of Undernourished (PoU) population’ is based on an opinion poll conducted on a very small sample size of 3,000,” it said. — The ministry said that since April 2023, the measurement data of children under five years uploaded on the Poshan Tracker has consistently increased – from 6.34 crore in April 2023 to 7.24 crore in September 2023. — “The percentage of child wasting, as seen on thePoshan Tracker, has been consistently below 7.2 per cent, month-on-month, as compared to the value of 18.7 per cent used for child wasting in the Global Hunger Index 2023,” the ministry said in a statement. — The ministry further said two other indicators, namely stunting and wasting, are outcomes of complex interactions of various other factors like sanitation, genetics, environment and utilisation of food intake apart from hunger which is taken as the causative/outcome factor for stunting and wasting in the GHI. — Also, there is hardly any evidence that the fourth indicator — child mortality — is an outcome of hunger, it said.— India ranked 107th out of 121 countries in the2022 editionof the Global Hunger Index (GHI), a tool for comprehensively measuring and tracking hunger at global, regional, and national levels. — The 2023 Global Hunger Index (GHI) shows that, after many years of advancement up to 2015, progress against hunger worldwide remains largely at a standstill. The 2023 GHI score for the world is 18.3, considered moderate and less than one point below the world’s 2015 GHI score of 19.1. — Furthermore, since 2017, the prevalence of undernourishment, one of the indicators used in the calculation of GHI scores, has been on the rise, and the number of undernourished people has climbed from 572 million to about 735 million. — The GHI said the compounding impacts of climate change, conflicts, economic shocks, the global pandemic, and the Russia-Ukrainewar have exacerbated social and economic inequalities and slowed or reversed previous progress in reducing hunger in many countries. (Source of the following definitions is globalhungerindex.org) Undernourishment:the share of the population whose caloric intake is insufficient(It is used as a lead indicator for international hunger reduction targets, including Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger)) Child stunting:the share of children under the age of five who have low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition; Child wasting:the share of children under the age of five who have low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition;(They are used as nutrition indicators for SDG 2 (Zero Hunger)) Child mortality:the share of children who die before their fifth birthday, reflecting in part the fatal mix of inadequate nutrition and unhealthy environments. Hungeris usually refers to the distress associated with a lack of sufficient calories. FAO defines “food deprivation, or undernourishment, as the habitual consumption of too few calories to provide the minimum dietary energy an individual requires to live a healthy and productive life, given that person’s sex, age, stature, and physical activity level.” Undernutritiongoes beyond calories and signifies deficiencies in any or all of the following: energy, protein, and/or essential vitamins and minerals. Undernutrition is the result of inadequate intake of food in terms of either quantity or quality, poor utilization of nutrients in the body due to infections or other illnesses, or a combination of these immediate causes. Many factors are cause it, for example, household food insecurit, inadequate maternal health or childcare practices, or inadequate access to health services, safe water, and sanitation. Malnutritionrefers to both undernutrition (problems caused by deficiencies) and overnutrition (problems caused by unbalanced diets that involve consuming too many calories in relation to requirements, with or without low intake of micronutrient-rich foods). Note: While overnutrition is an important concern, the GHI focuses specifically on issues relating to undernutrition. With inputs from PTIandglobalhungerindex.org Point to ponder:Methodology of Global Hunger Indexhas been rightly criticised. But conversation must go on. Do you agree? 1. MCQ Consider the following statements and answer the question below: 1. Malnutrition refers to both undernutrition and overnutrition, according to global hunger index. 2. As per the latest global hunger index, India has the highest child wasting rate in the world. Which of the above statement/s is/are correct? (a) Only 1 (b) Only 2 (c) Both 1 and 2 (d) Neither 1 nor 2 —ISROannounced that it had carried out a Trajectory Correction Maneuver (TCM) for its spacecraft Aditya L1, to ensure it reaches its destination at the Sun Earth Lagrangian point 1. — The Aditya L1 is to undertake a 110-day journey through space, one of the longest for an Indian spacecraft since the 2013-2014 Mars mission. — ISRO scientists had indicated that a TCM would be necessary for Aditya L1 soon after the spacecraft began its journey toward the L1 point on September 19, after orbiting the earth for 17 days. — Unlike lunar missions, which take about three weeks to cover the 384,400 km distance to the moon, deep space missions to Mars (distance of 225 million km) and the Lagrangian Point 1 (distance of 1.5 million km) take several months (Mars around 11 months and L1 around four months). — The longer distances require the mission to incorporate trajectory correction plans using orbit determination calculations, to ensure the spacecraft remains on course for its destination. — The Mars Orbiter Mission undertaken by ISRO between November 5, 2013 to September 24, 2014 required three TCMs on November 14, 2013, June 11, 2014 and September 22, 2014. What are Trajectory Correction Maneuvers? — The Aditya L1 spacecraft is to be injected into an orbit around L1. For this to be achieved, the spacecraft has to travel on a planned trajectory. — After the Trans Lagrangian Point 1 Insertion manoeuvre on September 19, scientists found that there could be trajectory errors that would need correction. — “There is a provision in the mission for this sort of manoeuvre, which is called a trim manoeuvre. This has been part of the mission plans sinceChandrayaan1 (2008). For every orbit-raising manoeuvre, we look at what was the orbit realised. If there is something to be done, we have to do it at the earliest,” said former ISRO scientist M Annadurai, who was closely associated with the Chandrayaan 1 and Mars Orbiter Mission. — In the case of near destinations like the moon, the trajectory corrections have to be done in the span of a week, and for longer destinations, as early as possible. — “The Aditya L1 is making a long journey. If there is a small deviation at the start, then over a month or three months, there could be implications,” the ISRO scientist said. — Smaller corrections involve firing of engines on the spacecraft for shorter durations, which results in conserving of fuel. Bigger corrections need longer firing of the engines. — “We have to assess how much correction is needed. It is a bit like assessing the petrol you want to fill,” Annadurai said. — The manoeuvres are required only in deep space missions. — The Mars Orbiter Mission witnessed three TCMs. The manoeuvres were carried out to ensure that the Mars Orbiters attained the right trajectory to reach a distance of 500 km (plus or minus 60 km) from the Red Planet. If the correction manoeuvres were not carried out, the spacecraft would have reached a distance of 723 km periapsis, ISRO scientists said at the time. What is the orbit that Aditya L1 must achieve around the L1 point? — When it reaches the L1 point around the second week of January 2024, Aditya-L1 will carry out a manoeuvre to enable it to orbit around L1, which is a balanced gravitational location between the Earth and the Sun. — The spacecraft will spend its mission life “orbiting around L1 in an irregularly shaped orbit in a plane roughly perpendicular to the line joining the Earth and the Sun,” ISRO said. — The L1 orbit is considered a challenge to acquire and maintain, and a few course corrections by firing of the engines may be needed in the mission life of the spacecraft. “It is not like an orbit around a planetary body. There are three dimensions to the orbit while other orbits around a planet are two dimensional, either equator or polar. Both the gravities play a role and there is pulling and pushing,” an ISRO scientist said. JUST FYI Where is theAditya-L1 mission going? — As the ISRO release says, the spacecraft will be put in orbit around the L1 point, from where it will be able to observe the Sun without obstructions. — A Lagrange point, as defined by NASA, is a position in space where “the gravitational pull of two large masses precisely equals the centripetal force required for a small object to move with them. These points in space can be used by spacecraft to reduce fuel consumption needed to remain in position.” — Basically, this means that at that point, the gravitational attraction and repulsion between two heavenly bodies is such that an object placed between them will effectively stay in the same relative position while moving with them. — The Lagrange points are named in honor of Italian-French mathematician Josephy-Louis Lagrange, and there are five of them: L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5. According to NASA, “The L1 point of the Earth-Sun system affords an uninterrupted view of the Sun and is currently home to the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Satellite SOHO.” — NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is at L2. “What is special about this orbit is that it lets the telescope stay in line with the Earth as it moves around the Sun. This allows the satellite’s large sunshield to protect the telescope from the light and heat of the Sun and Earth (and Moon),” NASA’s website says. What will the Aditya-L1 mission study? — The spacecraft carries seven payloads to observe the photosphere [the deepest layer of the sun we can directly observe], chromosphere [the layer about 400 km and 2,100 km above the photosphere], and the outermost layers of the Sun (the corona), using electromagnetic and particle and magnetic field detectors. Of the seven playloads, four will directly study the Sun, and the remaining three will in situ study particles and fields at the Lagrange point L1, “thus providing important scientific studies of the propagatory effect of solar dynamics in the interplanetary medium,” ISRO says. “The suits of Aditya L1 payloads are expected to provide most crucial informations to understand the problem of coronal heating, coronal mass ejection, pre-flare and flare activities and their characteristics, dynamics of space weather, propagation of particle and fields etc.,” the ISRO release says. Why is it important to study the Sun? — Every planet, including Earth and the exoplanets beyond the Solar System, evolves — and this evolution is governed by its parent star. The solar weather and environment affect the weather of the entire system. Variations in this weather can change the orbits of satellites or shorten their lives, interfere with or damage onboard electronics, and cause power blackouts and other disturbances on Earth. Knowledge of solar events is key to understanding space weather. — To learn about and track Earth-directed storms, and to predict their impact, continuous solar observations are needed. Every storm that emerges from the Sun and heads towards Earth passes through L1. Point to ponder:What isAditya-L1 missionand its objectives? MCQ: Which of the statement/s below is/are correct?

KEY TAKEAWAYS By Deutsche Welle — The hole, which scientists call an “ozone-depleted area” was 26 million square kilometers (10 million square miles) in size, roughly three times the size of Brazil. — The European Space Agency Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite made the recordings on September 16, 2023, as part of the EU’s environmental monitoring program. — Claus Zehner, the agency’s mission manager for Copernicus Sentinel-5P, told DW that this is one of the biggest ozone holes they’ve ever seen. — Experts believe the hole in the ozone is not likely to increase warming on the surface of Antarctica. — The ozone layer is a trace gas in the stratosphere, one of the four layers of the Earth’s atmosphere. — It functions as a protective gas shield that absorbs ultraviolet radiation, protecting humans and ecosystems from dangerous amounts of UV. Most skin cancers are caused by exposure to high amounts of UV radiation, so anything that shields us from UV rays helps reducecancerrates. — The size of the ozone hole over Antarctica fluctuates each year, opening each year in August and closing again in November or December. — Zehner said the ozone hole opens up because of the rotation of the Earth causing specials winds over the closed landmass of Antarctica. “The winds create a mini climate, creating a shield over Antarctica preventing it from mixing with surrounding air. When the winds die down, the hole closes,” he said. — Scientists believe this year’s big ozone hole could be due to the volcanic eruptions at Hunga Tongain Tonga during December 2022 and January 2023. “Under normal conditions, gas released from a volcanic eruption stays below the level of the stratosphere, but this eruption sent a lot of water vapor into the stratosphere,” said Zehner. — The water had an impact on the ozone layer through chemical reactions and changed its heating rate. The water vapor also contained other elements that can deplete ozone like bromine and iodine. “There isn’t much evidence the ozone hole is due to humans,” Zehner said. — While this year’s Antarctic ozone hole was likely due to a volcanic eruption, scientists became aware that human activities were creating huge ozone holes in the 1970s. — Ground and satellite-based measurements detected the holes, which were caused by widespread use of chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons. “The culprit behind ozone depletion was not aerosols in aerosol cans, but the propellants we use as gases to propel the solutions inside. These gaseous propellants contain chlorine, which is released high in the stratosphere and depletes the ozone,” said Jim Haywood, a professor of atmospheric science at University of Exeter in the UK. — The world took action after scientists raised alarm over the ozone holes, and quickly. In 1987,The Montreal Protocol was created to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of these harmful substances. — The good news is that the protocol was effective — ozone holes got smaller in the decades after ozone-depleting gas emissions were controlled. Is climate change reopening ozone holes? — Scientists agree that ozone depletion is not a principal cause of global climate change. — However, Haywood said there are signs that rising global temperatures could be having an impact on ozone holes. “Our mitigation of the ozone hole was working well since the 1980s, but in 2020 we were taken by surprise when the 2020 ozone hole was very deep and long lasting,” he told DW. — The same was true for 2021. Research showed that the main reason for the large ozone hole in 2020 was due to the wildfires in southeastern Australia that year. — Haywood said as the climate crisis carries on, with the Earth continuing to warm, fires are getting more common and more devastating around the globe. “It’s been an amazing bad year for boreal fires in the Northern Hemisphere this year. If that continues to happen, we get more smoke injected into the stratosphere, and we might get more ozone depletion coming back,” said Haywood. — It’s less clear what impact ozone holes have on the Earth’s climate. Some data shows that ozone holes actually contribute to cooling effects, as they reduce the greenhouse gas effect. — But Haywood said there is evidence ozone holes changes the progression of the seasons. “If you get ozone depletion, it takes longer for the hole to repair. This means you have a longer, more drawn out polar vortex, so you’ll have wintertime lasting that little bit longer,” he said. Point to ponder:What to read in ozone hole size? 3. MCQ: Which one of the following is associated with the issue of control and phasing out of the use of ozonedepleting substances? (2015) (a) Bretton Woods Conference (b) Montreal Protocol (c) Kyoto Protocol (d) Nagoya Protocol WHY IN NEWS? — The Centre has amended a key law so that it can specify competitive royalty rates for the mining of three strategically significant minerals — lithium, niobium, and rare earth elements (REEs). The decision comes after the government removed six minerals, including lithium and niobium, from the list of ‘specified’ atomic minerals, which could set the stage for private sector participation through auctioning of concessions for these minerals. KEY TAKEAWAYS Written byAnil Sasi — These changes to the rules build on an earlier move to ease the issuing of mining leases and composite licences for 24 critical and strategic minerals, which are vital in key supply chains that include electric vehicle batteries, energy storage devices, and high-end motors. What are these minerals? * Lithium is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal, which is a vital ingredient of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles, laptops, and mobile phones. In February, ‘inferred’ lithium resources of 5.9 million tonnes were established inJammuand Kashmir, the largest deposit in India. * Niobium is a light grey, crystalline metal with a layer of oxide on its surface, which makes it resistant to corrosion. It is used in alloys, including stainless steel, to improve their strength, particularly at low temperatures.Alloys containing niobium are used in jet engines, beams and girders for buildings, and oil and gas pipelines. Given its superconducting properties, it is also used in magnets for particle accelerators and MRI scanners. The main source of this element is the mineral columbite, which is found in countries such as Canada, Brazil, Australia, and Nigeria. * REEs or rare earths are a group of 17 very similar lustrous silvery-white soft heavy metals. Rare earth compounds are used in electrical and electronic components, lasers, and magnetic materials. What has government done and why is it relevant? — The government has specified new royalty rates by amending the Second Schedule of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. Currently, Item No. 55 of The Second Schedule of the MMDR Act, 1957, specifies a royalty rate of 12% of the average sale price (ASP) for minerals that are not specifically listed in that Schedule. This rate is much higher than global benchmarks. — The lowering of the royalty rates effectively aligns India’s royalty rates with global benchmarks, and paves the way for commercial exploitation of these minerals through auctions, which can be conducted by the Centre or states. A competitive royalty rate ensures that bidders would be attracted to the auctions. — After the Cabinet’s decision on Wednesday, lithium mining will attract a royalty of 3% based on the London Metal Exchange price. Niobium too, will be subject to 3% royalty calculated on the ASP, in case of both primary and secondary sources. REEs will have a royalty of 1% based on the ASP of the Rare Earth Oxide (the ore in which the REE is most commonly found). — The Ministry of Mines has laid down the way to calculate the ASP of these minerals, on the basis of which the bid parameters will be determined. — The idea is to encourage domestic mining, so that imports of these minerals can be lowered, and related end-use industries such as electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage solutions can be set up. These critical minerals are seen as an important prerequisite for India to meet its commitment to energy transition, and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. —LITHIUM:India currently imports all the lithium it needs. The domestic exploration push goes beyond the J&K exploration, and includes exploratory work to extract lithium from the brine pools of Rajasthan and Gujarat, and the mica belts of Odisha and Chhattisgarh. — India is a late mover in attempts to enter the lithium value chain. This is a time when EVs are seen as a sector ripe for disruption — the next couple of years are widely expected to be an inflection point for battery tech, with several potential improvements to Li-ion technology. — More than 165 crore lithium batteries are estimated to have been imported into India between FY17 and FY20 for an estimated $3.3 billion. China is a major source of lithium-ion energy storage products that are imported into India. —REEs:The rare earths constitute another hurdle in the EV supply chain. Much of the worldwide production is either sourced from or processed in China, and it can be difficult to secure supplies. — In an EV, the rare earth elements are used in the motors and not the batteries. A permanent magnet motor uses magnets embedded in or attached to the surface of the motor’s rotor — these magnets are used to generate a constant motor flux, instead of requiring the stator field to generate one by linking to the rotor. The magnets used in these motors are made with REEs such as neodymium, terbium, and dysprosium. — But rare earths are typically mined by digging vast open pits, which can contaminate the environment and disrupt ecosystems. When poorly regulated, mining can produce waste-water ponds filled with acids, heavy metals, and radioactive material that might seep into groundwater. Point to ponder: 4. MCQ: Consider the following statements and answer the question below: 1. India currently imports all the lithium it needs. In Electric Vehicles, the rare earth elements are used both in the motors and the batteries. Which of the following statement/s is/are correct? (a) Only 1 (b) Only 2 (c) Both 1 and 2 (d) Neither 1 nor 2 — The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation released the results of the Periodic Labour Force Survey for the period July 2022 to June 2023. This is the sixth PLFS report and each tracks a 12 month period between July and June. — The annual PLFS is conducted by the National Sample Survey Office in order to get an understanding about the state of employment in India. KEY TAKEAWAYS Udit Mishra writes: — The PLFS provides data on different metrics so that the policymakers can understand the proportion of people demanding work, the proportion of people among them who failed to get a job, the gender differences in employment as well as wages etc. — The PLFS also tells the sectoral distribution of workers in the economy — what percentage is involved in agriculture, for instance. It also records the type of work people do — for instance, how many are engaged in casual labour, how many work for themselves, and how many have regular salaried jobs etc. — PLFS collects data in two ways — Usual Status (US) and Current Weekly Status (CWS). Broadly speaking, within usual status, the survey respondent has to recall their employment details from the last one year while in the CWS, the respondent has to recall the details over the past one week. —The estimate of the labour force in the usual status includes 1) the persons who either worked or were seeking/available for work for a relatively long part of the 365 days preceding the date of survey and also 2) those persons from among the remaining population who had worked at least for 30 days during the reference period of 365 days preceding the date of survey — The estimate of the labour force according to the current weekly status approach is derived by considering those who worked for at least 1 hour or was seeking/ available for work for at least 1 hour on any day during the 7 days preceding the date of survey. Most of the findings below are all based on CWS. 1) Unemployment Rate (UER) — The UER is often the most talked about metric in popular discourse. Simply put, it refers to the proportion of people who demanded work over the past year and failed to get it. — For the population above 15 years of age, the UER has fallen significantly — from 6.6% to 5.1% over the last year (that is, July to June cycle). 2) Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) — The UER rate is calculated as a proportion of the population that is demanding work. But this population — which demands work — also goes up and down for a variety of reasons. The LFPR is a measure of the total population demanding work, and it is presented as a proportion of the total population that is above 15 years of age. — India’s LFPR, which had been inching up, shot up significantly in the past year. As of 2022-23, 54.6% of all Indians above the age of 15 were looking for a job. 3) LFPR for women — This metric looks at LFPR for among women to ascertain where the additional demand for jobs is coming from. — The data shows that female LFPR has gone up over the years but there were two discrete step-ups — one in 2019-20 (when India’s GDP growth rate had slowed down to less than 4% and this was before the Covid pandemic hit) and second in 2022-23 when it rose to 31.6%. 4) Worker Population Rate — The WPR is the percentage of persons employed among the persons in the population. Thus, instead of looking at how many demand a job and how many fail to get it, the WPR simply gives a measure of how many people have a job as a proportion of the total population. — This metric too has been going up and especially noteworthy are the two discrete step-ups in 2019-20 and 2022-23. 5) WPR among women — This metric throws light at the WPR for women to understand what’s leading to the spike in overall WPR. — Again, the WPR for women has been going up but two main spikes have been in 2019-20 and 2022-23. 6) Monthly earnings — The PLFS reports also provide a sense of how much do people earn in different types of jobs. — While it is true that incomes have broadly gone up — after falling during Covid — the main takeaway from this data emerges when one compares how little have monthly incomes changed over the past 6 years, especially in the face of a sharp rise ininflation. — To be sure, since late 2019, annual consumer inflation has always been above the RBI’s target of 4%. 7) Distribution of workers — The details of the three main classifications: self-employment, casual labour (say a construction worker) and regular salaried job are worth looking at. Self-employed has two sub-categories: (i) own account worker and employer and (ii) unpaid helper in household enterprises. — The data shows that self-employment has risen and jobs in the other two categories have fallen in proportion. — It is also noteworthy that self-employment among women is the key driver for this overall trend. Udit Misra writes: — At first glance, PLFS 2022-23 throws upsome positive trends:Unemployment rate continues to fall, LFPR and WPR see significant spikes. In particular, it is heartening to note that more and more women are joining the workforce. This would suggest that as the Indian economy recovers, more and more well-paying jobs are getting created. — However, when one looks at what these new jobs are and how much they pay, the understanding changes. — That’s because the only jobs that are getting created are of the “self-employment” type. When an economy grows, businesses employ people. When an economy struggles, people lose their regular jobs, and become “self-employed”. — Similarly, the trend for women across all metrics suggests that weak household finances have pushed women, who were outside the workforce in the past, to join in, often as “unpaid helpers in household enterprises”. — Similarly, sectorally, too, India seems to be moving backwards with the proportion of Indians employed in agriculture going up over the past year while those in manufacturing having fallen. — Lastly, a booming economy sees monthly incomes improve. However, that is not the case in India. Point to ponder:Labour force participation is up, unemployment is down. What about thequality of work? 5. MCQ: With reference to Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), which of the statements is incorrect? (a) PLFS collects data in two ways — Usual Status (US) and Current Weekly Status (CWS). (b) The PLFS data shows that self-employment has fallen. (c) For the population above 15 years of age, the Unemployment rate has fallen significantly, according to PLFS. (d) India’s Labor Force Participation Rate, which had been inching up, shot up significantly in the past year. — The government on Friday unveiled a report on the country’s artificial intelligence programme, which it believes will be a kinetic enabler for India to achieve the goal of USD 1 trillion digital economy by 2026. — Minister of Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar said that thedraft National Strategy on Roboticswill be part of the multi-year India AI programme. — He said that apart from supporting the startup ecosystem, India’s AI programme will focus on comprehensive skills in the country, building computer infrastructure etc. —The report recommends creation of India data sets platform to be used by domestic startups and researchers, building GPU (graphical processing unit)-based computer infrastructure to provide resources for development of AI engines or models to indigenous firms. — “India AI computer platform will be aPPP (public private partnership)project that will create substantial GPU capacity for our startups and researchers to train their models,” Chandrasekhar said. — He said India data sets will be a collection of data and may be one of the largest collections of anonymised data sets, which will be used by Indian researchers and Indian startups to train their model. — “Indian AI will also support development ofAI chips in partnership with the Semicon India Program,” Chandrasekhar said. —The recently concluded three-day conference, ‘SemiconIndia – 2023’, centered around ‘Catalysing India’s Semiconductor Ecosystem,’ aimed to further boost the sector and showcase the remarkable growth in India’s digital and electronic manufacturing industries. — The significance of semiconductors cannot be overstated; they are the foundational elements of modern technology and play critical roles in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, internet of things applications, 5G communications, electric vehicles, and more. — With the evolving global landscape in emerging technologies, the semiconductor industry is poised for substantial growth. — The government’s vision to reduce import dependency, establish domestic manufacturing capabilities, and attract investments in this sector are timely and effective measures. Point to ponder:India should play a role in shaping global AI regulatory order, while nurturing domestic ecosystem to buildAI expertise. Discuss. 6.

The storm bore down on the southern Chinese island province of Hainan on Monday, just south of the financial center of Hong Kong and the key manufacturing regions in the surrounding area on mainland China. The Hong Kong Observatory said on its website that Koinu was weakening from a typhoon into a tropical depression as it moved southwest along the coast of China’s Guangdong province. Air and rail services have been suspended as Koinu, meaning puppy in Japanese, rolled into the region. Koinu arrived a month after southern China and Hong Kong were lashed by Typhoon Saola, which triggered Hong Kong’s highest storm signal on a scale of 11. A week later, Guangdong province and Hong Kong were hit with the heaviest rains in almost 140 years. The storm also broke a windspeed record off Taiwan's east coast, which faces the Pacific Ocean. Ferry services connecting Hainan with mainland China were also suspended as Koinu moved across the island. The province is struggling to recover after its tourism industry was battered by China's draconian travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak."

Koinu comes just a month after Hong Kong was lashed by Typhoon Saola, which triggered its highest ""T10"" storm alert. A week after that, the city experienced its highest rainfall in nearly 140 years, flooding subway stations and malls, and causing landslides. Typhoon Koinu was at the third-highest alert in Hong Kong's warning system for most of the day. It was upgraded to ""T9"" for more than four hours -- when the typhoon was closest to the city -- before the observatory dropped it back down to ""T8"" at 11:50 pm local time (1550 GMT). ""In the past couple of hours, Koinu tracked westwards steadily. The associated hurricane force winds are gradually departing from the seas south of Hong Kong,"" said the observatory, issuing a map that showed Koinu's path headed directly for China's island province of Hainan. It was about 70 kilometres (43 miles) south-southwest of Hong Kong around midnight and was forecast to edge closer to the western part of the Pearl River Estuary. Despite the storm downgrade to ""T8"" -- which will be in place until 11 am Monday -- the observatory warned the public ""precautions should not yet be relaxed"", and said the gales generated by Koinu were expected to persist. The ""T8"" warning level is triggered when a storm's maximum sustained wind speed reaches 117 kilometres (72 miles) per hour. Koinu's were observed at 145 kilometres (90 miles) per hour. Around 90 flights were cancelled Sunday and 130 others delayed throughout the day due to the storm, according to Hong Kong's Airport Authority. Daycare centres, cargo terminals, ferries and buses suspended operations Sunday, while schools -- also closed -- will remain shuttered Monday. Hong Kong's government received reports of more than 20 people wounded during the typhoon Sunday, as well as more than a dozen incidents of fallen trees due to strong winds. In China's Guangdong province -- where Koinu is expected to sweep past en route to Hainan -- the cities of Zhuhai and Jiangmen issued a Level III emergency response, according to Xinhua news agency Sunday. That meant more than 35,500 fishing boats had to return to port, while dozens of coastal scenic areas were temporarily closed. Before moving to Hong Kong, Koinu had grazed nearby Taiwan, bringing torrential rain and record-breaking winds to its outlying Orchid Island. The storm left at least one dead, and knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of homes. Southern China is frequently hit during summer and autumn months by typhoons that form in the warm oceans east of the Philippines and then travel west.

Koinu -- which caused one death in Taiwan last week -- had weakened into a severe tropical storm by Monday, said the Hong Kong Observatory, as it moved toward the coastal areas of China's Guangdong province. The storm caused non-stop rain overnight, leading the agency to issue a ""black"" rainstorm warning signal -- its highest -- for about six hours before it was downgraded at 10:30 am (0230 GMT). More than 150 millimetres of rain were recorded over most parts of the territory since midnight Monday, and rainfall exceeded 300 millimetres over some parts of urban Hong Kong island, data showed. ""Heavy rain will bring flash floods... People should stay away from watercourses,"" the observatory said, adding that residents living near rivers be alert in case they need to evacuate. The city's third-highest storm warning signal -- ""T8"" -- was to remain in place until 11:40 am local time. Due to the storm warning, trading at the city's stock exchange was suspended in the morning session, but was expected to resume at 2:00 pm. Schools and daycare centres, ordered to shut when authorities issued the T8 signal a day earlier, remained closed Monday. This was the second time in a month the city has issued the black rain warning. In early September, Hong Kong experienced its highest rainfall in nearly 140 years, flooding subway stations and malls, and causing landslides. While no major damage was initially reported, the hoisting of the second-highest typhoon warning on Sunday evening caused issues at Hong Kong's international airport, where hundreds of arriving passengers were stranded without bus, subway or taxi services. ""A large number of arriving passengers had to wait for a relatively long time because the AirPort Express -- a main transport link between the airport and the city -- was suspended due to safety reasons,"" said an airport representative Monday. After the storm was downgraded just before midnight, ""12 train rides provided more than 18,000 seats for the passengers who waited an average of three hours"", the official said.

The country is still riding high on the trillions of dollars of government stimulus during the pandemic, Dimontold Bloombergon the sidelines of the JPMorgan Tech Starts Leadership Forum on Monday. American consumers are in good shape in terms ofsavings, debt, and overall wealth, while corporate credit remains solid, he said. However, Dimon singled out a couple of potential threats to the current situation. ""There are two things which are extraordinary today,"" he said. ""Think of them as storm clouds. We don't know if they're going to hit, when they're going to hit, what they're going to do."" The first one is the historic amount of fiscal spending in recent years, and therecord amount of federal debt, combined with the Federal Reserve's plan to shrink its balance sheet, Dimon said. But the ""biggest storm cloud"" isgeopolitical tensions, the billionaire banker said. He cautioned the Russia-Ukraine conflict affects everything from energy prices to food shipments, migration, and international trade and alliances. Dimon warned those forces could fuel inflation, especially as trends such as rising oil and commodity prices, the transition to clean energy, and the restructuring of global trade all threaten to push up prices. ""I don't think inflation will keep on coming down,"" he said. ""It may not, and therefore rates may go higher."" ""At a minimum I expect volatile markets,"" he added, before underscoring an even greater risk to the US economy. ""The worst case is stagflation,"" he said, referring to a double-whammy of high interest rates due to stubborn inflation, and the economy stagnating or even shrinking in size. ""If that happens, you're going to see a lot of people struggling."" Dimon advised people tobe prepared for interest rates to hit 7%, and he didn't rule out a painful downturn. While the Fed might achieve a soft landing where it crushes inflation without tanking the economy, a mild or harder recession remains a possibility, he said. The JPMorgan boss isn't the only Wall Street boss to be worried about the economic outlook. Citi CEO Jane Frasertold CNBCon Friday that she was seeing ""cracks"" appear as consumer demand softens, especially among poorer Americans who are struggling to navigate higher prices and steeper borrowing costs."

The units instead became a symbol of Russia's struggle to field any units capable of mounting an effective offense, the assessment said. The UK Ministry of Defence said in its intelligence update on Tuesday that Russia probably wanted the Storm Z units — sometimes styled as Shtorm-Z — to be ""relatively elite organisations which could seize the tactical initiative."" Instead, it said, they had ""effectively become penal battalions, manned with convicts and regular troops on disciplinary charges."" This tallies with reporting that suggested soldiers had been sent to such battalions as punishment — one man describedthis happening in an interview with Reuters. Despite the units' shortcomings, the MOD said, Russia was still relying on them for local offensive operations in Ukraine. The use of prisoners in storm units of Russian convicts has previously been reported, including by the Institute for the Study of War, whichsaid in September that the units had been sent to a region of heavy fighting, presumably to act as ""cover"" in case elite units needed to retreat. Fighters in the units and people with knowledge of them told Reuters this month that soldiers in storm units were seen as disposable. A soldier in a regular army unit said he was instructed not to treat injured storm-unit soldiers. ""Storm fighters, they're just meat,"" he told Reuters, adding that he disobeyed the instruction not to help them. One Storm-Z group of fighters said in a video in June that they would not obey orders to go back to the front line and alleged they were not given food, water, ammunition, or medical care, Reuters reported. The UK update said the storm units seemed to be sent to heavy fighting with little help from Russia: ""Multiple accounts suggest the units are given the lowest priority for logistical and medical support, while repeatedly being ordered to attack."" The MOD said Russia's struggles with building storm units showed the trouble it was having with building up an effective infantry, though its troops ""often conducted an effective defence."" ""The existence of Shtorm-Z highlights the extreme difficulty Russia has in generating combat infantry capable of conducting effective offensive operations,"" the MOD said. Reports and Western intelligence have also pointed to Russia's struggle to staff and direct its military since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This includesrelying on prisonersto replenish its fighters andseeing once-elite units being degradedby new members without any significant training."

The units, people by soldiers who break the rules, are sent into heavy fighting as cannon fodder with poor chances of survival, the agency reported. Reuters said the units are known as Storm-Z battalions. At least five of their teams were found fighting in the east and south of the country this summer, Reuters reported. The battalions have been around since April this year, but the Reuters investigation — published on Tuesday — is the first in-depth look into how they function and what kind of people they recruit. Reuters interviewed 13 people as part of the investigation, five of whom were Storm Z fighters. Each battalion is made up of around 100 to 150 people each and are usually embedded within regular army units, it said. Reuters found that soldiers are sent to Storm Z for being drunk on duty, for using drugs, or for refusing to carry out orders. ""If the commandants catch anyone with the smell of alcohol on their breath, then they immediately send them to the Storm squads,"" a regular Russian soldier, who requested anonymity, told the outlet. The soldier said he went against orders by giving medical treatment to a group of Storm-Z fighters who were wounded while fighting near the city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. ""Storm fighters, they're just meat,"" he told Reuters, adding that officers usually consider the fighters of lesser value than ordinary troops. The battalion also invites convicts to fight for them in exchange for a pardon, an approach previously used by the Wagner Group. Russian Ministry of Defence set up its Storm-Z program at the beginning of the year in the apparent hope of supplanting Wagner, whose founder Yevgeny Prigozhin was proving unruly. Serhii Cherevaty, a spokesperson for Ukraine's East military command said in June that there were more than 170,000 Storm Z fighters in their ""operational zone"",according to The Telegraph. Ukraine has also previously said that Storm Z troops show extremely low combat capability, according to a press release translated by the Ukrainian outletPravda. One Storm Z fighter told Reuters that almost everyone in his unit was killed in June around Bakhmut: 105 of the 120 men. Relatives of a missing Storm soldier fighting in Ukraine told Reuters that Russia's Defense Ministry never responded when they asked where he was. ""He was from a Storm unit. For them, no one is going to be in a rush,"" one relative, who was not named, told the outlet. In the summer, some Storm fighters said in a video that they refused to carry out combat missions due to their treatment. ""On the frontline, where we've been, we did not get deliveries of ammunition,"" a fighter in the video said, according to Reuters. We did not get water or food. The injured were not taken away: still now the dead are rotting."" Russia's Ministry of Defense did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment."

However, the convict-turned-fighter said he and others were given little warning of how horrific the combat would be. The remarks were made by a Russian ""Storm Z"" soldier — the unofficial designation for units often made of formerly incarcerated fighters. He made the comments to the toUS-funded outlet Sever Realii. In the BBC's translationof his words, the soldier said that he was enticed by a ""hunky-dory"" vision and large sums of money. As well as the wage and the injury promise, there was a $52,000 payout to families of a killed soldier, he said. The figures are vast for most Russians —one estimateputs the average monthly salary at around $750. The soldier said, though, that the pitch omitted that they would be sent into a ""total meat-grinder."" He said they were handed some guns and a limited number of rounds, and told to find the rest themselves, the outlet reported. The UK's Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update this week that ""Storm-Z"" battalions werefirst conceived as an elite force. But, it said, in reality they are staffed by Russia's worst soldiers — convicts and regular soldiers marked for punishment. The UK update said the units were the ""lowest priority"" for logistics and medical help. The BBC also reported that the units are formed mostly of convict soldiers, or soldiers re-assigned there as a punishment.The Institute for the Study of Warpreviously assessed that these groups are unlikely to be highly effective ""due to poor morale and discipline."" ""The Storm fighters are just sent to the most dangerous parts of the front, in defence and in attack,"" the open-source outlet Conflict Intelligence Teamtold Reutersin early October. There is evidence that Russia has been emptying its prisons to boost its fighting numbers, replicating the recruitment tactic formerly used by the private Wagner Group militia. In April, the UK's Ministry of Defenceestimated that at least 10,000had been recruited to the Russian army proper by using this playbook. The Washington Post, citing Deputy Justice Minister Vsevolod Vukolov, said that the Russian prison population had plummeted since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A rough calculation by rights advocate Olga Romanova for the outlet suggested that Russia recruited around 100,000 to its formal army, on top of 50,000 former convicts sent to war with the Wagner Group."

Parts of the East Coast, particularly the Mid-Atlantic, may get more snow than normal because of that, he said.Most of the country is predicted to be warmer than normal with that warmth stretching north from Tennessee, Missouri, Nebraska and Nevada, along with nearly all of California. The rest of the nation is forecast to be near normal or have equal chances for warm, cold or normal.

The forecast of added moisture stretches from Massachusetts down the East Coast along most of the South below Tennessee, and extending west through Texas, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Nevada and most of California, but excluding good chunks of New Mexico and Arizona.The Great Lakes region and the furthest northern parts of the nation stretching from Lake Erie to eastern Washington are forecast to be drier than normal.All this is because of El Niño, which is a natural periodic warming of parts of the Pacific that changesweather patternsworldwide and generally heats upglobal temperatures, Gottschalk and other NOAA scientists said. El Niño has its strongest effects, especially in the United States, during the winter. That's when it sends the jet stream, which moves storm fronts, on an unusual path that is dominated by warmer and wetter Pacific air plunging south.That means more rain in the South and extra storminess in the late winter, Gottschalk said. El Niño often means ""unusual severe weather across the state of Florida because of a strong subtropical jet stream,"" he said.Those changes in the jet stream often can bring a storm along the East Coast with moisture from the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico ""to get very juiced up"" and fall as heavy snow in big eastern cities, Gottschalk said. That depends on timing of temperatures and other conditions, so it's not likely to happen more than a couple times. But if the timing is right, ""these storms can really explode off the East Coast,"" he said.Travis Grout uses his cross country snow skis to get around the West Front of the Capitol in Washington, Feb. 6, 2010.

The insurer had revised down its earnings forecasts three times since the start of the year due to extreme weather turbulence and geological disasters. Tower now expects to post an underlying net profit after tax between NZ$7 million to NZ$10 million ($4.14 million-$5.92 million) in fiscal 2023, compared with an earlier forecast for between a loss of NZ$2 million and a profit of NZ$3 million. The reported profit for the fiscal year will be impacted by additional non-underlying costs including an increase to the customer remediation provision, the company said. It also expects large events cost for the year to total around NZ$38 million. The insurer was earlier expecting full use of its NZ$50 million large events allowance for the year. The company sees gross written premiums to total to NZ$526 million for the year ending Sept. 30, up 17% on the prior year. The jump reflects rating increases, organic growth, and strong customer retention, it said. Vanuatu and other vulnerable countries are already grappling with powerful impacts of a heating planet. The south Pacific island nation has been slammed by powerful climate-fueled cyclones, including two in March this year that left 10% of its population still in evacuation centers.

This data improved the accuracy of the model's results by an order of magnitude, compared with uniform distributions of spores used in early versions.The researchers found that sub-Saharan Africa was a source for 53% of all viable spores and 14% of viable spores that traveled across the Atlantic.""This is the region that should likely be targeted for addressing the disease,"" Gold said.The researchers note that the study is preliminary, with future work focused on gatheringobservational datafor corroborating the model's results—including creating remote sensing maps of dust storms and genomic comparisons of F. oxy betweendustsources and areas of disease outbreaks."

The boiling point we’re seeing today comes amid soaring costs of living and rising inequality, including growing pay gaps between workers and top executives. Now, thousands of workers who were asked to make sacrifices during the pandemic even as corporate profits soared are asking for better pay and protections — and walking off the job if progress isn't made in heated contract negotiations. At least 453,000 workers have participated in 312 strikes in the U.S. this year, according to Johnnie Kallas, a Ph.D. candidate and the project director of Cornell University’s Labor Action Tracker. This year’s work stoppages have spread across multiple industries — including transportation, entertainment and hospitality. Here's a rundown of some of the largest strikes taking place in the U.S. today.75,000 Kaiser Permanente workers walk off the job In the health care sector, a major strike kicked off this week — with some 75,000 Kaiser Permanente workerswalking off the jobWednesday in multiple states. Strikers include licensed vocational nurses, home health aides and ultrasound sonographers, as well as technicians in the radiology, X-ray, surgical, pharmacy and emergency departments. The Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions, which represents about 85,000 of the health system’s employees nationally, approved a strike for three days in California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington, and for one day in Virginia and Washington, D.C. Back in August, unions representing Kaiser workers asked for a $25 hourly minimum wage, as well as increases of 7% each year in the first two years and 6.25% each year in the two years afterward. Union members say understaffing is boosting the hospital system’s profits but hurting patients, and executives have been bargaining in bad faith during negotiations. Company executive Michelle Gaskill-Hames defended Kaiser — saying its practices, compensation and retention are better than its competitors. Kaiser has proposed minimum hourly wages of between $21 and $23 next year depending on the location. Kaiser is one of the country’s larger insurers and health care system operators, serving nearly 13 million people. The Oakland, California-based nonprofit said its 39 hospitals, including emergency rooms, will remain open during the picketing, though appointments and non-urgent procedures could be delayed. Doctors are also not participating in the strike, and Kaiser said it was bringing in thousands of temporary workers.UAW strike nears 3-week mark, with 25,000 on the picket lines In an unprecedented labor campaign against three major car companies,some 25,000 auto workershave joined picket lines in recent weeks TheUnited Auto Workers' targeted strikes against General Motors, Stellantis and Ford began at select factories after the union’s contract with the companies expired in mid-September — and have grown to a total of five vehicle assembly plants and 38 parts warehouses since. UAW President Shawn Fain has announced strike expansions on each of the past two Fridays, citing a lack of what the union says is meaningful progress, but it's unclear how much that will continue as the strike nears its 3-week mark. A person with direct knowledge of the talkstold The Associated PressWednesday that progress was reported at all three companies, with some offers being exchanged. Another said there was more movement in talks with Jeep maker Stellantis and less at Ford and General Motors. Neither wanted to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly about the bargaining. Fain will update members on the negotiations again Friday. The union isseeking36% general wage increases over four years, as well as a 32-hour week with 40 hours of pay, the restoration of traditional defined-benefit pensions for new hires and a return of cost-of-living pay raises, amongother benefits. The companies, however, fear that raising their labor costs could make their vehicles more expensive than those manufactured by Tesla or foreign automakers with U.S. factories where workers are paid less. Tensions have also risen amidlayoffsimpacting thousands of workers, with the auto makers saying some factories are running short on parts because of the strike.Striking Hollywood actors resume talks with studios Hollywood was taken by storm this summer with a historicdual strikefrom the unions representing writers and actors — bringing much of production to a halt. After five months on the picket lines, the writers strike wasdeclared overafter their union approved a contract agreement with studios last week. Meanwhile, actors are still on strike — but a shot at cutting their own deal isfinally on the horizon. The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artistsbegannegotiations Monday with the same group of major studios and streaming services, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, for the first time since theyjoined writerson the picket lines on July 14. The two sides resumed talks Wednesday. With similar sticking points to the writers, actors and their employers have been divided onissues of pay, theuse of artificial intelligenceand self-taped auditions. SAG-AFTRA leaders said they would look closely at the gains and compromises of the writers' deal, but emphasized that their demands would remain the same as they were when the strike began. The two sides said in a joint statement that “several executives” from studios would be in on the talks, without providing names.Southern California hotel workers' rolling strikes Thousands of hotel workers in Southern California have stagedstaggered walkoutsover recent months. Union leaders are calling for better wages, improved health care, higher pension contributions, better safety protections and less strenuous workloads, among other benefits. Members ofUnite Here Local 11overwhelmingly voted in favor of authorizing a strike back in June. After contracts expired at more than 60 hotels — including properties owned by major chains such as Marriott and Hilton — cooks, room attendants, dishwashers, servers, bellmen and front desk agents began picketing outside major hotels in Los Angeles and Orange countiesat the start of July. During the staggered strikes, workers have alsocalled for solidarityand a boycott of hotels in the Los Angeles area. According to United Here Local 11's website, the rolling walkouts surpassed the 100th strike mark last month. While walkouts continue at dozens of hotels, two companies have made agreements with the union to date. On Friday, United Here Local 11 said that Biltmore Los Angeles had reached a tentative contract agreement — joining Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites, which averted walkouts with a June deal promising higher pay and increased staffing levels."

Kyiv, Ukraine –In mid-October, Mamut Useinov performed on Sing Better Than a Star, a popular Russian television show for aspiring singers on the state-controlled Channel One network. “I’ve been anticipating this and can’t hide my excitement,” the 25-year-old from annexed Crimea wrote on Telegram on October 15, as he thanked “the Almighty” for the chance. But Useinov’s way to stardom was cut short. Five days after the broadcast, Useinov went to a “prayer house”, a type of informal mosque that offers a place to worship in the absence of officially sanctioned places for prayer. Heavily armed riot police officers detained him along with several dozen men who gathered for the Muslim Friday prayer in Kotelniki, an overpopulated southeastern suburb of Moscow where labour migrants settle because rent is cheap. All the men were forced into a police bus for an ID check and taken to a military conscription office in the nearby town of Lybertsy, according to Useinov and media reports. There, they underwent a medical evaluation that deemed Useinov “fit for military service”, despite flat feet and a recent surgery, he said. They were reportedly shipped to a military base east of Moscow and given a choice – go to jail or enlist. “We were all told that we have to sign one-year contracts, otherwise – jail,” he said in a Telegram-posted video on October 21, without specifying the charges they may face. He fears that once they sign the contract, the men will be sent to the front lines in Ukraine, the nation where Useinov was born and whose national he was, before accepting Russian citizenship in 2014, he wrote. “During a morning lineup, I heard we would all be send to the special military operation,” he wrote using the Kremlin’s preferred euphemism for the war in Ukraine. In a video he posted, he is seen in a small room filled with men next to bunkbeds listening to an elderly ethnic Russian man in camouflage. One more video shows the courtyard of a large building whose sand-coloured brick walls are adorned with a Russian flag and a banner reading, “Devotion to the motherland.” He went incommunicado on October 22. At the time of publishing, Useinov had not responded to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment. He has been taken to yet another military base for basic training, his representative told the Astra telegram channel on October 23. What Useinov described blatantly violated Russian rights legislation. The men were detained and denied access to lawyers. They were told about being conscripted without receiving a written notification issued by the conscription office where each man is registered – and then signed by the recipient. The men had no chance to overrule the forced conscription in court – or voice their objection to military service.Conscientious objectorshave a right to an alternative service in Russia. “This procedure violated all of my rights,” Useinov wrote. Dire demographic problems and oil wealth turned Russia into a magnet for millions of labour migrants from ex-Soviet Central Asia. SomeCrimean Tatars, a Muslim community of about 200,000 in the annexed peninsula, became part of this influx as they share ties with Turkic-speaking nations of Central Asia, a region their forefathers had been deported to en masse in 1944. Meanwhile, Russia’s mostly Muslim, impoverished and corruption-choked North Caucasus is one of the few regions with high birth rates, and hundreds of thousands also move to Moscow and other big cities. But attending a mosque almost anywhere in Russia can be complicated and sometimes dangerous. Moscow only has five official mosques, and tens of thousands of believers throng areas around them duringMuslimholidays, putting their prayer mats on the asphalt or even tram tracks. Most labour migrants choose to attend informal “prayer houses”, which some locals and police see as hotbeds of “extremism”. These houses have mushroomed because authorities routinely do not sanction new mosques, even though Muslims are Russia’s fastest-growing population stratum. While the Kremlin tries to revive its Soviet-era clout in the Middle East, courting Muslim leaders and calling Islam one of Russia’s “traditional religions”, Russian police snub religious rules and rights during their raids on prayer houses. They do not take their boots off, interrupt prayers, shower believers with slurs, and spray them with tear gas, according to dozens of reports, photos and videos. Far-right role Russian far-right nationalists help organise raids on “prayer houses”, in an apparent effort to kill two birds with one stone. They see the forcible conscription of Muslims as a way to rid Russia of unwanted “aliens” and help the faltering war effort, according to analysts. Zov (Call), a group whose closed Telegram channel has 141,000 subscribers, routinely informs police about Muslim gatherings – and proudly announces raids, detentions and deportations. “Just now, police visited two illegal mosques organised in apartment buildings. More than 70 people were rounded up. Awaiting deportation,” one of Zov’s posts said. The group is led by Andrey Tkachuk, head of a small media group in Moscow, and Andrey Afanasyev, a former staffer of the Tsargrad television channel whose oligarch owner Konstantin Malofeyev has been sanctioned in the West as a sponsor of separatists in Ukraine’s Donbas region. Muslim labour migrantshavefaced hate attacks, arbitrary detentions and arrests, police brutality, extortion and threats for decades. But after the Kremlin realised that its blitzkrieg in Ukraine failed amid disastrous losses of manpower, it threw a new curveball their way. As part of a nationwide series of raids dubbed “Illegal 2023”, police have been combing construction sites, markets, farms, restaurants, apartment buildings, hostels and “prayer houses” – or simply rounding up anyone who does not look Slavic, according to rights groups and media reports. During ID checks, they find “problems” – both imaginary and real, such as a lack of registration, a blurred stamp, or an expired work permit. The migrants are locked up and forced to enlist in military service, facing several kinds of threats to ensure their cooperation, an expert said. Shukhrat Ganiyev, a human rights advocate based in the central Uzbek city of Bukhara, told Al Jazeera that the pressure put on migrants included “threat of deportation of [their] families from Russia, the planting of drugs, an intolerable atmosphere for business”. He said some Uzbeks had signed contracts for construction jobs in the Russia-occupied southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, but then ended up on the front line – “and were not heard of since”. Police in St Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city and President Vladimir Putin’s hometown, said they handed conscription papers to 56 migrants with Russian passports after just one raid on a market on September 6. A month earlier, about 100 migrants were served with conscription papers, it said. The Illegal 2023 investigations are “tied to organisation of illegal migration, trade in drugs and psychotropic substances, arms trade and border crossings”, Ministry of Internal Affairs spokeswoman Irina Vovk said. Another way of forcing Muslim migrants into the trenches has been to deny Central Asians citizenship – a red Russian passport eliminates many of the problems with police and bureaucratic hurdles that migrants face. In one case, migration officials turned down an application from a Tajik man whose mother is a Russian national, according to rights advocate Tatyana Kotlyar. The man was told to enlist first, even though as a father of five he cannot be drafted, she said. In another case, an Uzbek man whose wife and child are Russian nationals, was told that “without a [military] contract and participation in the special military operation, they won’t even accept his citizenship application,” Kotlyar, who is based in the city of Obninsk 120km (75 miles) southwest of Moscow, told Al Jazeera. Both men did not reply to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. And in Kaluga, a region of more than one million people, some 200km (124 miles) south of Moscow, foreign workers have been barred from submitting citizenship applications in recent months unless they enlist, Kotlyar said. Officials at the Kaluga migration office refused to comment on her claim. And even if a migrant already has a Russian passport, recently adopted laws allow authorities to take it away with ease. “If you are a Russian national but are not ready to fulfil your military duty, a decision should be made to strip such a man of his citizenship,” Russia’s top investigator Aleksander Bastrykin told a military conference in mid-October. Bastrykin said earlier that migrants have a “constitutional duty to defend the nation that accepted them” and that enlisting them should be a “priority”. There have even been calls to abolish age limits for migrants so that they can be forced to serve in the military. The conscription age in Russia is between 18 and 30. “You became a Russian national at age 50 – go serve at 50,” nationalist lawmaker Aleksey Zhuravlyev said on October 24. Muslim migrants are among the most vulnerable people in Russia, said Sergey Abashin, a migration expert and anthropologist based in St Petersburg. They are often subject to the whims of police officers and officials because they “always” have problems with their documents, he said. “The [Russian] legislation’s very design makes it impossible to have absolutely ‘clean’ documents,” he said. The migrants are also dependent on the goodwill of their employers, as many work without the permits to do so. Meanwhile, public opinion is dominated by rampant nationalism, xenophobia and often portrays Muslim newcomers as hostile and alien, he said. “The sum of these dependencies makes migrants easily victimised,” he said. Very few make their cases public, fearing persecution of their families, rights advocates have said, adding the immigrants are accustomed to authoritarian rule and police brutality in their countries of origin, often know little about their civil rights in Russia, do not have access to lawyers, and may not speak much Russian. Where there is a stick, there follows a carrot – promises of hefty pay and a Russian passport. “Since at least May 2023, Russia has approached Central Asian migrants to fight in Ukraine with promises of fast-track citizenship and salaries of up to $4,160,” the British Defence Ministry said in September. In September 2022, Putin signed a decree that gives Russian nationality to anyone who has served on the front line for six months. The first Uzbek national taken prisoner in Ukraine said he was driven by financial interest, according to a Ukrainianmedia report. Lying on his back in a camouflaged coat, Mukhriddin Akhmedov, a 22-year-old student from the central Uzbek city of Samarkand, said he joined the Redoubt military company because he “needed money”. He said that “one more Uzbek” had joined the company. Looking ahead, the Russian military faces a shortage of manpower on the front lines after heavy casualties in the so-called “meat storms” on Ukrainian positions, experts have said. The shortage is exacerbated by Russia’s catastrophically low birthrates and a population loss of hundreds of thousands of people a year in the rapidly aging nation of 143 million. “By waging the war in Ukraine via the tactics of ‘meat storms’ and thus suffering heavy losses of manpower, the Russian military began experiencing a lack of cannon fodder,” Alisher Ilkhamov, head of the London-based Central Asia Due Diligence group, told Al Jazeera. Although their forcible conscription has undermined earlier official steps to limit Central Asia natives’ access to firearms – for years, Central Asian migrants were denied permits to buy hunting rifles – the political risk to Russian leaders is minimal. So far, there has only been a single public incident associated with the forced conscription of migrants. Last October, two Tajik nationals were forcibly sent to a training camp before departure to Ukraine. After the men, Ekhson Aminzoda and Mekhrob Rakhmonov, heard their commanding officers “insult their religion”, they got hold of a machine gun and killed 11 people and injured 15 others. The two were shot dead and pronounced “terrorists” by authorities. Meanwhile, the Kremlin is afraid to declare a second round of mobilisation in advance of the March 2024 presidential election, he said. The September 2022 “partial”mobilisationtriggered an exodus of hundreds of thousands of Russian men, making migrants more attractive targets. “In such conditions, the emphasis is on recruiting migrants, as their loss on the front line will not affect Russia politically or economically,” Ilkhamov said.

said.Meteorologists warned that the Ile-de-France region, which includes the capital Paris, could have violent wind gusts.The SNCF rail network said it would halt service on several of its suburban commuter lines around the capital, including the popular RER A train that serves western suburbs.Two French regions will also be placed on maximum flood alert, it added.Vast stretches along the French coast, from the Gironde region to the northern Hauts de France, will be on the lower category orange alert.In Pas-de-Calais, authorities said they would open two gymnasiums and several shelters for migrants who converge on the region, hoping to make it to Britain by boat.In Britain, the meteorological office said there would be bursts of heavy rain, a risk of flooding in some areas and gusts of 60-70 miles per hour along England's south coast.In France, the storm was even expected to unleash winds of up to 170 kilometers (106 miles) per hour, notably on the coastlines of Brittany and Normandy in the northwest, Meteo-France forecaster Francois Gourand warned on Tuesday.Rainfall could reach 50 millimeters within just six hours in those areas, the weather agency said.Ciaran is expected to hit Brittany before midnight Wednesday, with winds of up to 150 kmph on the coast, and 130 kmph inland with a second, more violent, storm phase following some hours later.Rail services

rivers and motorists not to drive through flood water.Storm Ciaran comes less than two weeks after Storm Babet claimed five lives in the UK in heavy flooding and high winds.""Some parts of south Wales and southwest England may see 80 mm (more than three inches) of rain,"" said Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Dan Suri.Officials said coastal flooding is likely from early Thursday.Flooding due to heavy rain has already seen some 12,000 sandbags deployed in the east of Northern Ireland.The Channel Islands, off the coast of northern France, have also been warned to prepare for flooding.As far as SpainIn Belgium, the weather office issued an orange alert for the Flemish coast, a yellow alert for the rest of the country, and urged ""great caution"".The cities of Brussels, Antwerp and Liege announced that parks would be closed.The Flemish provinces of West Flanders and East Flanders both said they would close access to outdoor sports facilities, and ban people from entering forests or natural reserves.In neighboring Netherlands, the weather service issued a code yellow alert for Thursday, while motorists were advised to work from home to avoid traffic jams.Several schools said they would be closed or partially closed Thursday.Ciaran's impact could be felt as far south as Spain, where wind speeds of up to 90 kph were expected for Thursday.Authorities asked people to take down tarpaulins, avoid walking under trees and removing flower pots from balconies.While storms are a naturally recurring phenomenon, they can be made worse by climate change, according to scientists.Flooding is likely to be exacerbated by rising ocean levels as a result of melting glaciers."

The feature was first announced at Google’s I/O developer conference in May , and now it’s rolling out to English users globally. You can access the feature from the three-dot menu that appears in Search and Google Images results. The search giant is also announcing updates to its Fact Check Explorer initiative and AI-powered Search Generative Experience. The “About this image” tool is designed to show you the origins of an image, including its metadata (when available), and provide vital context about how it’s been described by news and fact-checking sites over time. So you might see the first time the image was indexed by Google Search, and metadata might offer details about whether the image was AI-generated. Google already offers an “About this result” feature to help users vet text-based sources. “About this image” aims to show how old an image is and provide more context. Image: Google The release of the feature comes as huge amounts of disinformation are being spread about the Israel-Hamas war, often in the form of unrelated images being shared out of context . If someone goes looking for the origins of an image shared on social media, the idea is that Google’s tool should help provide them with answers. Unfortunately, there’s no mention in today’s announcement of being able to search using an image itself via Google Lens to access the “About this image” feature, which Google announced plans for earlier this year . It also said it would make the tool available via a right-click or long-press on an image in Chrome or by “swiping up in the Google App when you’re on a page and come across an image you want to learn more about.” When I asked, Google spokesperson Ned Adriance said these additional ways to access the tool are still in development and testing and will be released in the coming months. While the “About this image” feature has the potential to be a helpful tool, it still relies on users proactively taking steps to verify the source of an image. But as we’ve seen in recent months, it’s all too easy to share or engage with misleading images on social media (like a swagged-out pope ) without even stopping to think if it’s genuine. The “ Hurricane Shark ” photo, for example, has been going viral in the aftermath of hurricanes for over a decade , despite Google’s top search results for terms relating to the image labeling it as a fake. As well as “About this image,” Google is also highlighting an improvement it’s making to its Fact Check Explorer . This tool launched in beta earlier this summer and lets you search for image fact-checks by either uploading an image or searching using its URL. Though still in beta, Google says it’s releasing a new API to help fact-checkers and journalists integrate Fact Check Explorer into more workflows. Finally, Google says it’s also experimenting with using generative AI to offer more information on online sources within its AI-powered Search Generative Experience . These AI-generated descriptions will display in the “About this result” tool and are designed to fill in when existing sources like Wikipedia or the Google Knowledge Graph don’t have information on a smaller website. Update October 25th, 2:00PM ET: Article updated response from Google on additional, upcoming ways to access the tool. Comments"

The astronomers spotted a high-speed jet stream in Jupiter's atmosphere just over the equator about 25 miles above the cloud layer. Incredibly, the jet stream is more than 3,000 miles wide and travels around 320 miles per hour, ""twice the sustained winds of a Category 5 hurricane here on Earth,"" according toNASA. ""This is something that totally surprised us, said University of the Basque Country physicist Ricardo Hueso who co-authored the study reporting these results in the scientific journalNature Astronomy. FromCNN: Researchers compared winds detected by Webb at high altitudes with those within the lower layers picked up by [the] Hubble [Space Telescope] and tracked changes in wind speed. Both space observatories were necessary to detect the jet stream, as Webb spotted small cloud features and Hubble provided a look at the equatorial atmosphere, including storms not related to the jet. The two telescopes provided a broader look at Jupiter's complex atmosphere and the processes taking place within the layers. ""We knew the different wavelengths of Webb and Hubble would reveal the three-dimensional structure of storm clouds, but we were also able to use the timing of the data to see how rapidly storms develop,"" said study coauthor Michael Wong, planetary scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who led the associated Hubble observations, in a statement.

The sinking has contributed to worsening flood risks, including at sporting arenas, roadways, and a busy airport. A study on the slight elevation changes throughout the city was published in the journal Science Advances last week. Researchers from NASA and Rutgers University documented the city rising and sinking at different rates from 2016 to 2023 by using a remote sensing technique called interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). This combines several 3D observations of a region to reveal changes over time. Through those observations, the researchers found that the NYC metropolitan area is sinking at a median rate of about 1.6 millimeters (0.06 inches) a year. Several locations around the city, including Arthur Ashe Stadium in Queens, a runway at LaGuardia Airport, and Interstate 78 (this includes the Holland Tunnel), are sinking at a rate of more than 2 millimeters (0.07 inches) per year. That sounds tiny, but it adds up over time to increase flood risk throughout the city. There’s an ancient reason for some of this sinking. During the most recent ice age, which ended over 11,000 years ago, much of the Northeast U.S. was covered in ice, a post from NASA explains; much of New York City sits on land that was once slightly elevated and is now coming back down. Development has also played a role. Some of the sinking locations, like LaGuardia Airport, were built on top of landfills. The sinking has occurred alongside a worsening climate crisis that has increased flooding from rising ocean levels and heavier rainfall. Sea levels around Manhattan rose by more than 4 millimeters a year between 2000 and 2022. “The city has long dealt with coastal flooding from both hurricanes and extratropical storms, but as seen with Superstorm Sandy in 2012, storm surges associated with severe weather events are becoming more destructive because of ongoing sea level rise,” the study authors wrote. “The relative rise in sea level during the 20th century resulted in an additional $8.1 billion in damages from Sandy than would have occurred a century prior.” Residents have witnessed the consequences first hand. Despite billions of dollars of updates to LaGuardia Airport, that area has not been spared from damage due to extreme weather. Late last week, heavy rainfall over the NYC area created flash flooding in subway stations, across highways, and at the airport. Travelers had to wade through several inches of water in the terminals, NBC New York reported. Researchers also found that some parts of New York are actually rising. They noted that Newton Creek in Brooklyn is rising at a rate of about 1.6 millimeters (0.06 inches) a year, while the neighborhood of Woodside, Queens rose about 6.9 millimeters (0.27 inches) between May 2016 to December 2019.

But thetyphoon, with wind speeds nearing 200 km/hr, also provided scientists with a rare glimpse into the capacity of seabirds to withstand extreme storm conditions—conditions that seabirds may increasingly be faced with under future climates.Analysis of tracking data following the passage of Typhoon Faxai revealed that while most of the tagged shearwaters appeared to be either unaffected by or had managed to circumvent the storm, one male had not been so lucky. Over the 11-hour period during which this shearwater bird was tracked, it completed five full circular loops of 50–80 km diameter each and was transported a total distance of 1,146 km.Under normal conditions, streaked shearwaters typically fly at speeds of 10–60 km/hr and altitudes below 100 m, and remain at sea; by contrast, tracking data indicated that the bird caught in the storm had attained speeds of 90–170 km/hr, soared to an altitude of 4700 m, and was carried over mainland Japan before the typhoon swung back into the Pacific Ocean.Although it cannot be known for certain, it is possible that the shearwater was capable of escaping from the typhoon but instead chose to ride it out until the storm moved back over the ocean. Like most birds adapted to a life at sea, streaked shearwaters typically fly at very low altitudes, an efficient flight strategy over theopen oceanthat also puts them at higher risk of collisions with buildings, power lines and vehicles when over land. Moreover, they are clumsy on solid ground, and if forced to land, have difficulty taking off, rendering them highly vulnerable to predation.Pelagic birds resort to a wide range of tactics to avoid being caught within the tumult of large storms. Red-footed boobies and great frigatebirds, for instance, often take to the wing and ascend tohigh altitudes, allowing storms to pass below, whereas Eastern brown pelicans simply sit them out, remaining grounded until conditions improve. Still others elect to stay within the eye of the storm, where winds are calmer.But as warmer air and surface-water temperatures intensify storms throughout the world's ocean basins, questions are being raised about the ability of oceangoing birds to endure powerful storms that are projected to be a common occurrence. As Shiomi notes, improving understanding of how oceangoing birds cope withextreme weatherwill provide essential insight into the response—and resilience—of seabirds to the increasingly adverse environmental conditions expected under future climates."

This devastating tempest off the west coast of Britain played a pivotal role in the founding of the shipping forecast and has had an enduringimpacton weather forecasting in the UK and beyond.Winds gusted at 100 miles per hour between October 25 and 26 that year—higherthan any previously recorded in the Mersey, in north-west England. And it's considered to be themost severeIrish Seastormof the 19th century. More than 800 lives were lost and the storm sank or badly damaged more than 200ships. But it also paved the way for the creation of the shipping forecast.The storm is named after the most famous of the ships lost to the waves, a steam and sailing ship called theRoyal Charter. After a two-month journey from Melbourne in Australia, the Royal Charter was heading towards Liverpool with its valuable cargo of gold. The ship was caught in the full fury of the storm off the coast of Anglesey, Wales.Despite the crew's valiant efforts to anchor the ship and cut its sails, the Royal Charter was driven onto the rocks in the early hours of October 26. With the help of villagers onshore, they succeeded in saving around 40 passengers. Other passengers had tried to swim to shore but were weighed down by the gold in their pockets and drowned. The ship eventually split in two and the waves claimed the lives of more than 450 passengers andcrew members, including all the women and children aboard.The tragic loss of life and property made the storm headline news. It even came to the attention ofCharles Dickens, who was working as a journalist in London at the time and visited the site of the wreck soon after the storm.The shipping forecast and the Met OfficeWeather observations had been collected from around the British coastsince 1854by a part of the UK Met Office known then as the Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade. The Royal Charter Storm, however, highlighted a need for more accurateweatherforecasting and a national storm warning system.Vice AdmiralRobert Fitzroy, founder of the Met Office, had been lobbying for the creation of such a storm warning system since the summer of 1859. Following the Royal Charter storm, Fitzroy was able todemonstratethat it could have been predicted.In December of that year, the new storm warning system was approved and the first warning was issued in February 1861. This was delivered by telegraph to harbor towns, who then hoisted cones and drums on a mast to warn vessels in harbors and along the coast of the incoming storm.The UK's storm warning service—which later became known as theshipping forecast—is the longest running national forecasting service in the world. Today, the Met Officeprovidesthe shipping forecast on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, and issues a forecast four times a day for the 31 areas of sea around the British Isles.A lasting legacyIn addition to itsmeteorological legacy, the effects of the storm can still be seen around the Welsh coastline to this day. On Anglesey, thegravesof those who died in the wreck can be found in many churches along the coast. Gold nuggets have alsowashed ashorein recent years.Further south, in Cwmyreglwys, Pembrokeshire, stand the remains of Saint Brynach's church, which was partially destroyed by the storm.Since 1859, the Met Office has madesignificant stridesin the field of meteorology. In August 1861, the first publicweather forecastwas printed in The Times, then broadcast on the radio in 1922 and was eventually seen on television for the first time in 1936.Step by step, the Met Office has pioneered new technologies by launching the world's first meteorological satellite in 1960 and using the firstforecastby a computer in 1965. It has continued to invest in state-of-the-artsupercomputersto improvesevere weatherand climate forecasting since then.Today, the Met Office is a globally recognized authority in meteorology and climate science. Its expertise is invaluable for numerous sectors, from aviation and agriculture to emergency services and infrastructure planning. The Met Office is now responsible for providing theNational Severe Weather Warning Service, which includes warnings for wind, rain, thunderstorms, lightning, ice, fog, snow and extreme heat.Through the Met Office's dedication to scientific research and accurate forecasting, the UK and the world have benefited from improved weather predictions and increased preparedness for extreme weather events. The legacy of the Royal Charter Storm lives on in the Met Office's ongoing mission to provide essential weather and climate services, safeguarding lives and livelihoods in an ever-changing climate."

My ex-husband left the marriage right before Covid started. I was in a bad spot. I had a toddler. I wasn't working at the time. Southern California is a really bad place to be when you're unemployed and suddenly divorced because you need a lot of money to survive there. And money was something I did not have. I was really depressed. Jobs were shutting down in Southern California at that time. Everything was closed. My son's pre-school and his daycare shut down. I had no job and I couldn't get a job because of the lack of daycare. The homeless situation in Costa Mesa became a much bigger issue too. I had people defecating on my lawn. One time someone dumped a whole bunch of food on my son's head when we were walking by. I never felt safe in my area. I felt like a prisoner in my apartment. I remember telling my dad, I'm just done. I want to fast-forward to the end of my life. I can't live like this anymore. I don't know what the answer is, but it's not here. There has to be another place. One day I saw this video of Texas. It was drone footage of a beautiful area in the Hill Country. It looked so peaceful and green in this quaint little town. I said, that's where I want to go. On a whim, I did it. I didn't have money for a flight so I went on a train with my son. It took 24 hours to get to San Antonio. I felt like I stepped onto another planet. I was at the Riverwalk and there were people around. They weren't stuck in their houses. They were going to restaurants — in masks — but they were living their lives. I came back from my trip and said to my ex-husband, I know this might sound crazy, but we have split custody and I want to move to Texas. You have to come too because I'm not going to take your son away. I was thinking he would say no. But he said he hated California too. The rest was history. New Braunfels is one of the top 10 fastest-growing cities in the US. It's almost 100,000 people now. But it's still set up like an adorable small town. It looks like a Hallmark movie. It's a cute little town with parades and festivals. We have a beautiful river that people come to to go tubing. When I came here at first, I was thinking I might live in San Antonio. I thought maybe I'm more of a city person. But I just fell in love with the small-town thing. It's a lot easier to get a job here. Once I had a job in Texas, I got a cheap little apartment with my son. In the last three years, I've moved up to a much higher-paying job. I don't make that much money, but I was thinking of moving out of my apartment into a nicer one. People started asking me, why don't you just buy a house? I would never have dreamed I could buy a house. That's for rich people. But people started telling me about all these programs, like the Texas first-time homebuyer, that you can qualify for. I started doing some research. I set up an appointment with a builder. They put me in contact with a loan mortgage officer who helped me qualify for a program. My mortgage officer helped me over the course of a couple of months consolidate my debt and pay off my debt, making sure I had a good debt-to-income ratio so I would be approved. To make a long story short, I got a home with no down payment. I just pay the mortgage every month. It has changed my life. I remember thinking in California that that was the end. I've already been married. It didn't work out. I'm never going to have a stable job. I'm never going to have enough money to support myself and my son. I paid $1,750 for rent in a crappy little apartment in California. Now, three years later, my whole payment, including mortgage and property taxes is $1,800 a month for my three-bedroom house. This house changed everything. It's not just a home. This is my future. This is what I'm going to give my son when he's old and I pass away. My son loves it in Texas. We moved here right when he turned five so most of his memories are now here. He loves being outdoors and going on camping trips and tubing in the river. He's taking archery. The school system here is much better too. I love the South and its hospitality. The people are very friendly. You can talk to anyone on the street and probably trust them. I still find it a bit difficult to make friends. I'm not sure why that is. Maybe I really just am from another culture. Politically, I'm a strong libertarian. That wasn't something that was accepted in California. I felt like I couldn't be true to myself in California because I wasn't accepted for who I was and what I believed. In Texas,a big part of the culture is independence and freedomand being responsible for yourself while still having empathy for others. I can share my opinions here. That's freedom to me. I'm not a huge fan of the gun culture here. I like that guns are more rare in California. But it's something I've had to accept. When I first moved here,the big ice storm hit. That was scary. It definitely made me realize that the infrastructure here is not as good. There's not as much of a reliance on the city or the state to help you as there is in California. That was something I wasn't ready for. I saw that Texans are used to that though. When the ice storm hit and we had no electricity and our water was contaminated everyone said, no problem, come to my house, I have water. We worked together. But nobody had any concept of wondering why the state wasn't helping. I just have had to accept that things are wilder here. But with regards to crime, it's night and day. Crime is not dealt with in California. They just kind of look the other way. That's absolutely not true in Texas. And that's a big deal to me. I'm by myself with my son and I don't want to live in a place where I don't feel safe. I never felt safe in southern California. It's absolutely gorgeous there. I lived right by the beach. Here we have all kinds of crazy storms. You never know what the weather is going to do. It's something you have to battle against. I also miss the food in Los Angeles. It's like no other. You just can't compare. Most of all I miss my friends and my family. Nothing can replace that here. But moving here changed my life so dramatically. Something as simple asmoving across the countryhas made my life go in such a different direction. I would never leave here."

This is particularly true for extreme events such as storm fronts, tropical storms and cyclones. These weather patterns, which last from a few days to a few weeks, will change in the future due to climate change. In particular, the average energy input into the ocean from mid-latitude storms is expected to decrease, while equatorial regions will become more active. Scientists call these different weather patterns ""Atmospheric Synoptic Variability"" (ASV).Two climate researchers—Dr. Olaf Duteil from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel and Professor Dr. Wonsun Park from the IBS Center for Climate Physics and Pusan National University, Korea—have now for the first time investigated the integrated effects of long-term changes in theseweather patternson the Pacific basin in a modeling study. The results show how important it is to take these changes into account inclimate models. They have nowpublishedtheir findings in the journalnpj Climate and Atmospheric Science.From a climate point of view, the weather is usually considered as ""noise"" and is not systematically analyzed in long-term climate projections, say the two researchers. ""However, it is not enough to look at average atmospheric properties, such as mean wind speeds, to understand the influence ofclimate changeon the ocean,"" says Duteil, ""it is crucial to consider the cumulative effect of short-term changes in weather patterns to get a complete picture.""The researchers expect that future changes in Atmospheric Synoptic Variability will affect the mixing of the ocean's layers, as a smaller or larger input of kinetic energy into the ocean due to weather phenomena will lead to less or more mixing, respectively. The researchers predict that the reduction in ASV insubtropical regionswill lead to a shallowing of the mixing layer in the ocean, while it will become deeper at the equator as ASV increasesThey also show that a future reduction in ASV decreases the strength of oceanic circulation systems—the so-called subtropical and tropical cells—and the large-scaleocean circulation. These systems connect mid-latitudes and equatorial latitudes via upper ocean pathways. They are driven by the trade winds north and south of the equator, regulate the upwelling of equatorial waters and play a fundamental role in determining the surface temperature of the oceans and thus primary productivity in the tropics.This study highlights the need to better quantify ASV and weather patterns in climate models, as changes in ASV have a large impact on future upper ocean circulation and mean properties. Duteil states, ""This quantification should be used to improve our confidence in projections of future climate, especially when analyzing large ensembles of climate models."""

Weather can have a huge impact on the successful operation and bottom line of family entertainment centers. With hotter summers and more extreme weather, planning is key to profitability. Excessive heat, torrential rain, snowstorms, wildfires resulting in poor air quality—the list goes on, as does the need for planning and preparation. As an Eagle Scout, my motto is “Be prepared,” and as the operator of multiple family entertainment centers (FECs), my team and I practice planning and preparation. This experience has shown me that being proactive impacts safety, staffing and sales. Here's what FECs need to keep in mind. Be nimble when the weather changes. Many FEC operators look at bad weather and decide to close for the day instead of finding the silver lining in every cloud. FECs in Florida, for example, know that a passing rain shower is no big deal, so most folks go about their business. But in dry areas of California, inclement weather can paralyze those unfamiliar with driving in the rain. Monitor weather conditions, and be nimble. In my experience, most operators don’t cut staff quickly enough when bad weather is in the forecast for their area. When you see cancellations, cut staff and hours immediately. But before shutting down completely, look first at how you can leverage the weather to your advantage. For example, chilly evenings are an opportunity to promote hot toddies by the fire pit or savoring drinks under the stars warmed by a cozy patio heater. Excessive heat is an invitation to come inside and enjoy icy, cool air conditioning in the arcade. Rainy days at home with the kids are no fun; get them out of the house and actively gaming in the arcade while you sip a beverage and supervise—everyone wins. Any opportunity to position your FEC as a respite from the weather should be maximized to generate revenues. If you are not prepared, you will lose sales. Develop advertising and social media messaging templates in advance so you can quickly react to changing weather situations. Prioritize safety and comfort for guests and staff. For FECS with an outdoor component such as miniature golf, kiddie rides, batting cages, go-karts or laser tag, begin by reviewing your assets. How can you deal with extreme heat? Shade trees are an option but require time to mature. Awnings, sunshades, umbrellas and shade sails can help cool areas on a permanent or semi-permanent basis, while an outdoor misting system or portable misters can help to keep guests and employees comfortable. Hydration stations stocked with cold drinks, along with a gift shop carrying personal fans, sunglasses, hats, umbrellas and sunscreen, are additional revenue streams. Guests won’t stay if they're too hot, so keep them cool. Make sure your team members are properly hydrated and safe in excessive heat as well. Rotational shifts, extra water and cooling breaks, wick-away garments, reflective gear and lightweight uniforms can make a big difference in safety, comfort and performance. Inclement weather might require rain gear, while cold weather calls for heaters, windbreakers, jackets, heavier uniforms and proper footwear. Some of this branded gear can also be sold in your gift shop as fan swag and souvenirs. Wildfires and poor air quality present both challenges and opportunities. When the air quality is bad, make sure your team members are safe and close unless your FEC has a big enough indoor component such as laser tag, video gaming or an arcade. These assets can be leveraged to offer comfortable indoor fun in a climate-controlled environment, so employ your pre-developed sales strategies and templates to advertise and promote an attractive and fun alternative on social media in real time. The bottom line: Have a plan for any weather. For clear skies and smooth sailing in any weather, have a plan and a program in place. Develop strategies and tactics for everything from a sprinkle to a downpour, as well as plans for lightning, hurricanes and named storms that require securing anything that could float or blow away. Be proactive, monitor weather conditions and be ready to act quickly. Being prepared just might make you more profitable.

SAN DIEGO — Col. Thomas Bedell had been commanding Marine Corps Air Station, Miramar in San Diego for just one day, in July 2021, when he got a message from the base energy management director. The city power system was straining under a heatwave, and it was time to start up the microgrid. ""So I said, yes! Start up the microgrid! And then I texted, what is the microgrid?"" Bedell recalled with a laugh. It fell to Mick Wasco, who has been energy management director at Miramar since 2010, to explain to Bedell that Miramar was set up to run the base without using power from the city of San Diego in the case of a local or national power grid failure. ""By 2012, we started producing landfill gas electricity specifically for MCS Miramar,"" Wasco said, ""Keep in mind, this is the size of a small city.""

Using energy sources including solar and methane gas from the rotting garbage in a massive San Diego city landfill located inside the base, Miramar can go 21 days in a self-contained state that's called ""island mode."" Or as Col. Bedell says, aircraft carrier mode. ""I half-jokingly refer to Miramar as the USS Miramar. If you think about the installation as an aircraft carrier, suddenly the need to have redundant power to have energy-resilience, water, food-resilience makes complete sense,"" he said.

It makes enough sense that it's official Department of Defensepolicy: The Pentagon's stated goal is that all bases be ""power resilient."" The best path to resilience in case of a disaster is often a local renewable source, and that pairs well with another Pentagon goal — for bases to becarbon neutral by 2050. That will keep key defense capabilities intact in the case of an attack on the U.S. power grid, or more likely an extreme weather event, as climate change worsens droughts, heatwaves, wildfires and storms.

Right: Diesel engine in the engine room at MCAS Miramar.Alan Nakkash for NPRhide caption Hurricane Michaeldevastated Tyndall Air Force Basein Florida in 2018. The rebuild is incorporating a microgrid built for the base by the local utility. ""Florida Power & Light provides us the ability to 'island' that critical headquarters building and its functions from the rest of the installation, should there be a power loss,"" says Mike Dwyer, deputy chief of the Air Force Natural Disaster Recovery Division. Getting industry partners involved made funding and building the microgrid faster than the Pentagon's normally glacial procurement process. In the next big storm, Dwyer said, the base will be able to keep up critical defense operations. ""It's designed to operate the first Air Force or Air Force's North Headquarters building completely independently for up to four and a half hours,"" he said. Dwyer said Tyndall is still at least 3 to 5 years away from having a grid that could run the whole base. A Pentagon spokesperson said 90% of key bases worldwide have at least a plan on becoming energy independent, and the Defense Department currently gets 15.9% of its energy from renewable sources, and expects to be at 25% renewable by 2025.

The DoD is among the world'slargest emitters of carbon dioxide,so it's exciting to see them take an interest in renewables, said Lisa Cohn with the site Microgrid Knowledge. ""The military's interest in microgrids is really, really important — because the military does tend to deploy new technologies before anyone else,"" she said. The progress is mostly driven by the fact that it makes tactical sense. It can save soldiers' lives at war. Producing energy on base means trucks don't have to haul in fuelfor generators to power bases in war zones, a vulnerability that proved deadly in Afghanistan and Iraq. Brandon Newell was a Marine artilleryman in 2003. He remembers rushing north from Kuwait into Iraq, only to run out of fuel. ""It was about speed and agility and moving fast to attack Baghdad. We outran our logistics and it was ... a pause for four days sitting on side of the road so that our logistics could catch up,"" he said. That experience marked him. Newell firstspoke to NPR in 2011at a remote combat outpost in Helmand, Afghanistan where he was setting up small-scale renewable power for the Marine Corps. Detail of diesel engine at MCAS Miramar.Alan Nakkash for NPRhide caption Newell says the troops don't really care if it's a carbon-neutral solution — as long as it helps them fight and survive. In Afghanistan, resupply convoys hit by roadside bombs were making up a huge share ofU.S. military casualties. ""We have these distributed forces that are constantly requiring bullets, band aids, food and fuel,"" he said, ""These huge convoys make you even more of a target."" Newell retired as colonel, and started a company promoting the mobile combat energy solutions he says will be even more important in the next war. He spent his last years in the Marine Corps helping stand-up the microgrid at Miramar Air Base. Miramar is also demonstrating how microgrids in the military can make the civilian power-grid more resilient. It can provide a working headquarters during storms or heatwaves for the state or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), according to Col. Bedell. ""Our ability to be able to continue to operate and provide that base from which we could help the local community or the state is really important,"" he said. It makes sense for every state to have disaster-resilient grids on military bases, he said, and Miramar has already helped out. During a heatwave in 2022, the state energy grid was under theheaviest load in California's history. This time, Bedell got a surprise text from San Diego Gas & Electric asking if Miramar could go off city power to reduce the load and avoid outages. ""At the request of SDG&E, we turned on the micro grid to support our own utility requirements during peak hours for 10 days in a row. And that that prevented about 3,000 homes from having to go into potential blackout,"" said Bedell. The Navy even ""unplugged"" its docked ships from the city's power grid to help. While the military tends to focus on the use of microgrids against tactical threats, Bedell says climate change itself is also one of those threats. ""We need to be part of this solution. And if we are negatively impacting the climate change that is causing societal disruption, that's not working ourselves out of a job. That's creating the problem that we're wanting to solve,"" he said. Loading..."

[+] hardened their plants and taken steps to reduce flooding. They’ve also worked to improve communications between retailers and suppliers to anticipate disruptions, but storms still impact production. With three months left in 2023, the U.S. has already set a record for the most billion-dollar weather events in one year and, globally, the hottest summer on record. This kind of extreme weather plays a significant part in the volatility in the oil and gas sector, resulting in prices, supply and demand often swinging drastically from hour to hour. While shorter than recessions, weather events have super-sized effects on the entire oil and gas supply chain. Hurricanes Many kinds of weather can affect supply, from blizzards and ice storms to tornadoes and flooding, but most notable are tropical systems. Nearly half of the total petroleum refinery capacity and 51% of the total natural gas processing plant capacity in the United States is along the Gulf Coast, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This area is also historically in the path of many tropical storms and hurricanes. These storms don’t just impact land operations but also up to hundreds of miles out to sea, where extreme storms can disrupt everything from shipping routes to drilling platforms. According to the EIA, a “high impact” hurricane that disrupts Gulf of Mexico crude production by 80pc could increase monthly average retail gasoline prices by up to 30¢/USG. This year’s Hurricane Idalia put pressure on the Gulf operations, with three platforms evacuating employees, and traders watching the impending storm drive oil prices up in the days before landfall. In the past, other notable storms have impacted the industry, including Hurricane Zeta in 2021, which drove an 8-million-barrel drop in regional oil stocks that affected the broader U.S. supply. In response to the growing threats from these extreme storms, many refineries have hardened their plants and taken steps to reduce flooding. Extreme Temperatures We are already seeing cooler temperatures as we move into autumn, which is a relief from the months of unrelenting high temperatures. Extreme temperatures—hot or cold—have a significant impact beyond consumer demand. Refineries, which are typically designed to operate between 32 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit, can experience equipment malfunctions, reduce production capacity and create unsafe working environments, which can further delay operations under extreme heat conditions. Although tropical systems are typically associated with oil and gas disruption, extreme temperatures can cause more production loss. For example, in February 2021, frigid temperatures shut down more U.S. refinery capacity than Hurricane Harvey. The extended cold spell caused 5.6 million b/d of outages along the U.S. Gulf Coast and Midwest compared to Hurricane Harvey, reducing production of nearly 4 million barrels of oil per day. The bitter cold brought about by the 2021 Polar Vortex was a stark reminder of the cascading effect extremely low temperatures have on the oil and gas industry. The storm caused wellhead freeze-offs and power outages that debilitated gas producers, leading to a shortage of gas when demand was spiking. Gas shortages combined with iced-down processing units led to individual unit outages and entire closures at 25 refineries in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Tennessee. Freezing temperatures can cause malfunctions that might require a shutdown, such as flow control equipment failure or frozen product within the piping system. It can also create a hazardous situation when the weather warms up. When the temperature drops, the liquid freezes in the pipe and expands. This expansion can cause the pipe to crack, and once the temperature rises, the pipe will start to leak, creating a potential fire hazard. And even though we have moved beyond extreme high temperatures for now, it is important to note that extreme heat affects a refinery’s ability to run at full capacity and can limit the electricity supply refiners need to run their operations. For example, this year the utilization rate in the Gulf Coast fell in June and July, with several sizable outages in the region in July and August. The Increase of Extreme Weather Events As most research points to extreme weather events increasing in frequency and intensity, the oil and gas industry is already improving its preparation and response. The introduction of new standards, processes and hardened equipment indicates the industry is preparing for current weather impact and future climate changes. One area that can further build resilience is by tapping into integrated real-time weather insights. From optimizing shipping routes for vessels carrying natural gas and petroleum to protecting employees on offshore platforms, or proactively planning for unavoidable weather events, weather intelligence can enhance efficiencies and support safe operations. Further, when these weather insights, such as what regions, terminals and refineries are likely to be affected, are coupled with fuel demand data, supply chain players can plan ahead to make strategic supply, pricing and purchasing decisions."

That's a welcome boon to a state that has spent much of the past dozen years in a deep drought, forcing state leaders to grapple with how the state should share and manage its water in the future. A series of winter storms in early 2023 busted the state's most recent dry spell. State officials measured 33.56 inches (85.2 centimeters) of precipitation through the end of September. California's “water year” begins annually on Oct. 1 so it can include all of the fall and winter months when California gets the bulk of its rain and snow. The state depends on those wet months to fill its reservoirs that supply water for drinking, farming and environmental uses throughout the state. Those reservoirs dipped to dangerously low levels in in recent years because of an extreme drought. That prompted water restrictions on homes and businesses and curtailed deliveries to farmers. It also threatened already endangered species of fish, including salmon, that need cold water in the rivers to survive. Statewide, reservoirs held 27.4 million acre feet of stored water as September ended. One acre foot of water is enough to supply two families of four for a year. Of that, about 4.5 million acre feet are held in the State Water Project, a network of 30 reservoirs and storage facilities that provides water to 27 million people. “This was as close to a miracle year as you can get,” said Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources. The reservoirs were helped by a series of nine strong storms that hit California over the winter. Those storms carried so much rain and snow they were known as “atmospheric rivers.” They caused widespread flooding throughout the state and were blamed for multiple deaths. The storms also dumped tons of snow on the mountains. The state snowpack on April 1 was 237% above its historical average. It's just the fourth time since 1950 the state's snowpack exceeded 200% of average, according to Michael Anderson, the state's climatologist. All of that snow melted in the spring and summer, filling rushing rivers and reservoirs. Water levels at Lake Oroville rose 240 feet (73 meters) between Dec. 1, 2022, and the end of the snowmelt period. That's the largest increase in storage in one season since the reservoir opened in 1968, according to Ted Craddock, deputy director for the State Water Project. State and federal officials will have to drain some of the reservoirs to make room for more water that's expected to come this year. The state's rainy season could be complicated by El Nino — the natural, temporary and occasional warming of part of the Pacific Ocean. El Nino affects weather patterns around the world. California typically gets more rain and snow during El Nino year. This year’s El Nino has a 56% chance to be considered strong and a 25% chance to reach supersized levels, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The potential for more strong storms this year, particularly along the coast, “keeps me awake a little bit at night,” said Gary Lippner, deputy director for flood management and dam safety with the California Department of Water Resources. “We just do not have extensive flood systems on the coast of California,” he said. “That's an area we're paying particularly attention to.” All of the rain and snow this year could have played a part in what has so far been a smaller wildfire season. Wildfires exploded in size during the drought in part because of the super dry conditions. So far this year, just over 476 square miles (1,234 square kilometers) have burned in California. That's well below the five year average of 2,031 square miles (5,260 square kilometers), according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. ___ This story has been updated to correct the amount of acre feet of storage the reservoirs in the State Water Project finished the year with. It was 4.5 million acre feet, not 27.4 million."

The impacts are not over as further rain is expected.The risk was clear well before the event. Storm Babet wasofficially namedby the UK Met Office on Monday October 16 and a rarered weather warningwas issued on the Wednesday, 32 hours before the heaviest rain started.Red weather warnings areused by the Met Officeto communicateextreme weather eventsthat pose a risk to life. This was only the fourth time a redwarninghad been issued for rainfall.The Scottish Government's Resilience Operation wasactivated,flood defenses were closed, roads and bridgesshut, households evacuated and emergency rest centers opened. These advance warnings undoubtedly kept many people safe.How did forecasters know it was coming?Meteorologists were tracking the storm using satellites and weather observations. Every day they became more confident about when and where the heaviest rainfall would land.Storm Babet is anunusual weather system. Storms that hit the UK in the autumn and winter normally come from the west across the Atlantic, but Babet instead traveled from Portugal, picking up moisture from the Bay of Biscay before being trapped over the UK by a hard-to-budge high pressure system across Scandinavia. This resulted in a prolonged period of wet and windy weather and widespread flooding.Babet causes rain across almost the entire British Isles at once. Map shows rainfall from 6pm October 19 to 6am October 20 2023: the white and black colours show the areas of heaviest rainfall. Credit:Starling Roost Weather integrated radar (Data: Met Office),CC BY-SAThe heaviest rainfall has been over the Angus hills in eastern Scotland, visible in white and black in the map below. As UK weather systems tend to come from the west, dumping their rain over the first hills they encounter, the eastern side of Scotland is usually protected from the worst of the weather. That is why forecasters were particularly concerned.The previous highest 24-hour rainfall in the area was 100mm recorded in November 2022, with 60mm-70mm recorded during Storm Frank in 2015. The rainfall from Storm Babet is alreadyover 160mm. Unlike those in western Scotland, rivers in the region are simply not big enough to carry that much rainfall without bursting their banks.What hydrologists knewHydrologistssuch as myself study how water moves across and through the landscape, which is key to forecasting floods. Alongside the exceptionally high rainfall, other factors made Angus and south-east Aberdeenshire particularly vulnerable. The hills funnel water into steep rivers that rise quickly and rush towards the sea, so towns and villages along them areno strangers to floods.In this instance, heavy rain ten days ago meant that the ground was already saturated. Instead of soaking into the ground, any rain that fell during Storm Babet would quickly have flowed into the streams and rivers causing them to overflow.Scotland has a rainy side and a dry side. Credit: Met Office,CC BY-SAA storm like this is far beyond anything experienced in living memory of those in the region. Without any first hand knowledge to rely on, computer models help forecasters identify where the biggest floods will be. With Babet, hydrological models were able to pinpoint the area of concern (the redweatherwarning) to the rivers draining off the Angus hills.Similar models predicted that the South Esk river would rise above its flood defenses in the town of Brechin, meaningfloodwarnings could be issued and the difficult decision toevacuate 400 residentsto safety could be made on Thursday afternoon rather than in the middle of the night. It turned out to be good decision, as by Friday morning the river in Brechin was at its highest level on record, and had indeedbreached its defenses.Preparing for more extreme events in the futureThis is yet another reminder that the climate is changing and we will see more extreme rainfall, putting more people at risk. The ""Clausius-Clapeyron"" relationship states that for every 1°C increase in air temperature there is 7% more moisture—meaning that there is morerainfallin a given downpour.The relationship between this and flooding ismore complexsince it also involves interactions with the landscape (How have urban areas expanded? Are there many trees? What sort of farms are there? Are rivers forced into embankments or allowed to meander through floodplains?).Flood forecasting model from the day before the storm peaked. The purple and red colours show the rivers expected to see the highest flows. Credit:Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) / UKCEH,CC BY-SABut understanding these interactions is urgent. TheBrechin flood defenseswere completed in 2016 and designed to protect the town from floods up to a 1-in-200-year event. No one expected them to be topped less than ten years later.Despite the devastation evident today, the value of advance warnings for Storm Babet for saving lives, property and infrastructure is clear. To help the UK be better prepared for floods, many hydrologists—including me—are working together through the newUK Flood Hydrology Roadmapto further improve the science and data underlying those warnings."

Homes raided and a music festival under attack. More than 900 Israelis have been killed as a result of themost devastating assault on Israelsince the Yom Kippur War of 1973. Hamas militants broke through the fences surrounding Gaza on Saturday morning, attacking Israeli soil by land, sea and air, using mechanized hang gliders and motorbikes to storm communities caught completely unaware. ""They came through the streets on pickup trucks with turrets on the back, spraying bullets, everything around them at the civilians walking up and down the street,"" Maj. Doron Spielman, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces in the city of Sderot, which was overwhelmed by Hamas and subsequently liberated, told ABC News' Ian Pannell. ""Women with little babies. People dying on the ground."" Hamas fired at least 3,000 rockets from Gaza into Israel, targeting towns and cities in southern Israel. The majority of the rockets were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, but what is considered to be a major intelligence failure by the Israeli authorities saw Hamas storm swathes of territory in Israel's south. In the skies above the Supernova Festival, taking place near the kibbutz of Re'im -- approximately 3 miles from the Gaza border -- those rockets were the first sign of what was to come. At least 260 people were killed there, according to the Israeli authorities, with video emerging of Israelis fleeing on foot across the desert and some being kidnapped and taken back to Gaza. One of the attendees, Noam Manket, said that those who tried to flee in their cars were shot by Hamas gunmen. She fled on foot and is yet to hear from some of her closest friends who attended the festival with her. ""You just keep running because you realize that if you don't keep running, then you don't go back home,"" she told ABC News. More than 100 Israeli citizens and soldiers are believed to have been taken hostage in Gaza. In a statement, Hamas has threatened to execute the hostages if the devastating bombardment of the Gaza Strip, launched in response to the surprise attack. President Joe Biden said Monday at least 11 Americans are among those killed, and more may have been kidnapped and taken hostage in Gaza. Many families learned that their family members had been kidnapped after identifying them from videos shared on social media. One of those taken was Karina Ashaev. Her sister, Sasha, described what it was like when she first saw her in a video online, bound and covered in blood as she was driven away on a motorbike.

It's all about catching the right gusts of wind to soar. How do they identify the best air currents though? By listening carefully. New research suggests that the birds can hear the very low-frequency sounds from the ocean's waves that are affected by the wind conditions. FromScience: Researchers tracking the paths of these long-distance fliers report today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences thatthe very low frequency noise made by clashing waves influences the birds' headings. The species joins a small but growing list of animals—including elephants, prairie dogs, and homing pigeons—that make use of such ""infrasounds.""[…] Big waves produce a very low frequency sound, below 20 hertz and beyond the limits of human hearing, that can travel thousands of kilometers, particularly when they collide with long distance swells, such as when storms develop. Samantha Patrick, an ecologist at the University of Liverpool was curious about whether the birds could key into these infrasounds—the ""voice of the sea,"" she calls it—to find the perfect wind.[…] During their long-distance flights, the birds tended to change course whenever they encountered a loud infrasound, the team reports. The infrasounds often indicate wave turbulence, even storms—though it's not yet clear how the birds make use of this information. The infrasound clearly impacted the birds' behavior, although the scientists couldn't identify a clear pattern of whether they avoided or aimed for these low frequencies."

It's grown in every presidential administration since, both Republican and Democratic, with its inaugural class of 20,000 service members swelling to more than 1.25 million. But now Congress is considering halving the program, eliminating tens of thousands of national service member opportunities. These deep cuts defy common sense, public opinion, and wise investing. Congress has a responsibility to be faithful stewards of our tax dollars. But that's precisely why it must continue supporting AmeriCorps: every dollar it invests in national service yields a$17 return on investment to the country, according to a 2020 analysis. Its impact is reflected in the public’s widespread support. AWith Honor Action national surveyfound a supermajority of Americans, nearly 90 percent, support voluntary national service. A majority in the same poll also said that a more robust national service program would help bridge our country's political divisions. The early days of AmeriCorps were an experiment, a proof-of-concept that national service could solve community problems and transform young people into active citizens. It's not an experiment anymore; we know national service works and works well. And the challenges at which AmeriCorps has proven most adept are the same ones facing our nation today:pandemic-era remote learning that set back our kids' education, the struggle of working families to put food on the table amidst inflation, and natural disasters that batter our communities. Opposition to national service is largely rooted in a misunderstanding of the program's design, operation, and oversight. National service doesn't happen in federal government buildings. As a vehicle to address community-level challenges, AmeriCorps's decisions and budget are principally managed by governors and its services are delivered by community, nonprofit, and faith-based organizations. When you find AmeriCorps members in national and state parks, in the aftermath of storms and fires, and at the whiteboards in our schools, it's because states and communities wanted them there. Haley Barbour, the former Republican governor of Mississippi, said AmeriCorps members did the ""back- and heart-breaking work of dredging the Gulf Coast"" in the days and weeks following Hurricane Katrina. AmeriCorps ""helped save Mississippi,"" he said. Those who've watched AmeriCorps know some of its greatest triumphs were born in America's most profound tragedies — from Katrina to the devastating fire in the Lahaina community on Maui, when hundreds of AmeriCorps members stepped up to aid the injured, serve as caseworkers for families searching for loved ones, and to help those affected and displaced by the disaster to access housing and healthcare. President Clinton—and leaders in both parties over the last 30 years—have invested in AmeriCorps, and have fought to grow and strengthen it because they believe in the idea that Americans will do the hard, necessary things to improve our communities if given the chance. AmeriCorps has touched tens of millions of lives in every state. But the legacy of national service shouldn't be measured in the million-plus members who've served; it's in the students whose lives AmeriCorps members changed for the better, the churches whose food pantries have been stocked and staffed, and the nonprofits who were able to serve more of our veterans and seniors. The spirit of service that fuels AmeriCorps has united Americans of every color, class, faith, and political party for 30 years. Congress should build on that legacy, not diminish it. America deserves nothing less."

The state's home insurance market is reeling after disasters like this one. MIAMI — Many in Florida are findinghomeowners' insurance unaffordable, and it's only getting worse. Gregg Weiss lives in an older neighborhood in West Palm Beach. His home and many others are nearly a century old. It's a great place to live he says, except when it comes to buying homeowners insurance. Two years ago, he was shocked at a notice he received from his insurance company. ""The windstorm portion of our insurance went from about $10,000 a year which is not cheap,"" he says. ""But it doubled and went up to $20,000."" He called his insurance agent and got some surprising advice. ""She said honestly, my recommendation is: pay off your mortgage and self-insure yourself."" Weiss, who's currently serving asPalm Beach County's mayor, says he and his wife took her advice. They paid off their mortgage and dropped their insurance. And he knows others who are doing the same. But for homeowners in Florida who have mortgages and are required to carry insurance, there's little recourse except to cover the steep increases. There are reports that because of the high insurance costs, some are beingforced to leave the state. In many places, including California, Colorado and Louisiana, there's been a steep rise in the cost of homeowners' insurance. But it's particularly staggering in Florida, a state that already has the highest insurance costs in the nation. Many Floridians have seen insurance premiums go up by more than 40% this year. And despite efforts by lawmakers to stabilize the market, costs are likely to keep rising. Officials have heard the complaints. After a recent hearing at the state Capitol in Tallahassee,Florida's insurance commissioner, Michael Yaworsky, said, ""Everyone is in this together. It is a very difficult time for Florida homeowners."" The cost of homeowners' insurance in Florida is more than three-and-a-half times the national average. There are lots of reasons — among them, the three hurricanes that battered the state in the last two years. But policymakers and the insurance industry say excessive litigation has played a major role in driving up prices. Yaworsky says reforms passed by lawmakers last year and signed by the governor have begun to limit lawsuits. ""After years of trying to get it done,"" he says, ""the governor and others finally pushed it through. And it should improve the situation over time."" Butstate Sen. Geraldine Thompsonsays nearly a year after the bill was signed, homeowners in her Orlando district are still waiting. ""We find now the litigation has gone down,"" she says. ""It has dropped. But the premiums have not dropped."" Another inexorable factordriving up insurance costs is climate change. Sophisticated modeling by bigreinsurance companieshas led the industry to take a hard look at the risk in places like Florida, which is struggling with sea level rise as well as more dangerous storms.Benjamin Keys, a professor of real estate at the University of Pennsylvania, says, ""What we have is a real changing landscape in insurance markets, a recognition that risks have increased in recent years. Disasters are occurring with more frequency and severity than previously forecast.""

Nearly a thousand homes were destroyed, making it the most destructive wildfire in Colorado history. The rising cost of construction — up nearly 40% over the last five years — is also driving up premiums. In Florida's challenging market, seven insurance companies became insolvent over the last year. But, following the recent legal reforms, Mark Friedlander with theInsurance Information Institutebelieves the market may be stabilizing. ""Companies that were not writing business are opening up again and starting to write risk. And companies are starting to see some positive light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said. Five new insurance companies have been approved to begin writing policies in Florida. Even so, Friedlander says,homeowners shouldn't look for relief anytime soon. It's a similar outlookin California,Louisianaand many other states seeing double-digit increases in the cost of insurance. Real estate professor Benjamin Keys says if private insurers keep backing away from what they see as high-risk markets, the federal government may be asked to step in. ""Will we see a national wind insurance program? Will we see a national wildfire insurance program?"" He says, ""I think that those are possibilities."" There is a precedent. More than 50 years ago, because private insurance wasn't available, the federal government created theNational Flood Insurance Program."

I've been saving up a good chunk of my money to splurge on all the coolest gadgets and accessories that I don't want to pay full price for but would love to own. Portable power banks are high up on that list. It's nice to have about two to three battery packs at hand. You never know when you might be in an unfortunate situation, and it might come in handy. Usually, one of these power banks costs a lot if you want fast charging, larger capacity, and decent specs. Wireless charging ones are even more expensive, which is why seasons like Black Friday and Cyber Monday are great for snagging discounts and deals. So, without further ado, here are the power banks I'm hoping to buy this Black Friday. 1. Shargeek Storm 2 The Shargeek Storm 2 is an achingly beautiful accessory that boasts an insanely cool transparent design. It's a weighty device with a gigantic 25,600mAh capacity. Sure, this power bank isn't portable, but it's just so good-looking and unique that any nerd like me can't resist it. Not only does the Storm 2 have one USB-A and two USB-C ports, but it also comes with a DC port that's rated for up to 75W power input and output. This makes this the ideal power bank for juicing up just about anything, including laptops that don't charge via Type-C. Shargeek also includes a matching yellow USB-C cable and an LED screen built-in. While this 100W USB PD battery pack usually retails at around $229, it regularly goes on sale during shopping festivals like Prime Day and Black Friday. We say a 30% discount on Shargeek's power banks during the October Prime Big Deals Day sale, so hopefully, the upcoming sales will be even better. Enthusiast's power bank The Shargeek Storm 2 is possibly the geekiest charging device around, in the best sense. Its transparent design, LED screen, and included ports are all incredibly useful and good fun, too. 2. Baseus Blade 100W Power Bank The Baseus Blade 100W Power Bank has achieved a nearly legendary status at this point, and for good reason. This mighty power solution once saved me from a very dangerous situation, and I've been a fan ever since. The 20,000mAh portable power bank is impressively slim, though it is pretty wide, so you can't pop it in a purse or bag as easily. While I used to own one of these before, I recently moved overseas and accidentally left mine behind. This clever accessory has been tremendously helpful to me in the past, which is why I've got to score one this Black Friday. Sadly, I missed my chance during the October Prime Day sales when it was nearly half off, but I'm hoping with all my might that it's on sale for the same amount or even cheaper in November! The 100W Baseus Blade also has an LED display. You get two USB-C PD 3.0 ports with support for PPS charging, meaning all phones and laptops can charge at their top speeds as long as they support a maximum of 100W. There are two USB-A ports as well. Baseus includes one of its famously reliable C-to-C cables in the box, along with a sleeve to carry the cable and the power bank. Trustworthy brand Baseus never fails to deliver when it comes to high-quality charging products. The Blade 100W Power Bank is sleek, has a high capacity, comes with plenty of ports, and delivers super-fast charging speeds to various devices on the go. 3. Goal Zero Sherpa 100 PD Qi After the Shargeek Storm 2, this is probably the next most-wanted power bank on any technophile's wishlist, myself included. Unlike most other high-capacity power banks, the Goal Zero Sherpa 100 PD Qi actually comes with wireless charging support. It may not be transparent, but this battery pack doesn't need sex appeal to win anyone over. The raw specs and power are impressive enough. You get a whopping 25,600mAh cell with 100W charging speeds, as long as you use the right USB-C cable with it. Sadly, Goal Zero only includes a 60W cable in the box. On top of that, the Goal Zero Sherpa 100 PD Qi portable power bank has two USB-A ports, a single USB-C PD port, and a 15W Qi wireless charging pad embedded on the top. There's also a small indicative LED display on the side. You can utilize the same Type-C port for power input and power output, thanks to a toggle on the back. Goal Zero does not go easy on the price, asking for an astounding $200 for the handy battery pack. And this is exactly why I refuse to buy it at full price, even if I love the concept and am confident that it will benefit me greatly. With crossed fingers and bated breath, I'm hoping for a fantastic deal that will allow me to finally have the Goal Zero Sherpa 100 PD Qi in my possession. No wires, no problem Need a lot of energy on the go? The Goal Zero Sherpa 100 PD Qi is one of the best high-capacity power banks with an ace up its sleeve: a 15W Qi wireless charging pad built-in."

A new study finds it is unlikely that humans will successfully limit average global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the lower target set by the 2015 Paris agreement.Marco Ugarte/APhide caption Hurricane Otis devastated the Mexican city of Acapulco, after rapidly intensifying over abnormally warm ocean water. A new study finds it is unlikely that humans will successfully limit average global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the lower target set by the 2015 Paris agreement. It is unlikely, but not impossible, for humans to hit the lower temperature target set by the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, according tonew researchconducted by an international group of scientists. The most catastrophic effects of climate change, such as mass extinction and catastrophic sea level rise, kick in more aggressively if temperatures rise above the Paris agreement targets. The findings are a reminder that, although renewable energy useis increasing, humans are still deeply reliant on fossil fuels and are pumping enormous quantities of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere each year. The Paris climate agreement set a goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to average temperatures in the late 1800s. That lower target is looming. The average temperature on Earthover the last decadewas about 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial temperatures. In general, it's easier to use Celsius in this context because both the United Nations and scientists use it. And the target numbers are nice and round. But here's how those numbers look in more-familiar Fahrenheit: humans are trying to limit warming to between about 2.7 and 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and right now we're already at about 2 degrees Fahrenheit of warming. The new study, published in the journalNature Climate Change,calculates how much carbon dioxide humans can still emit before hitting that 1.5 degree Celsius limit. If humans keep emitting planet-warming greenhouse gasses at the current rate, that threshold will be reached in about six years, the authors find. ""We don't want this to be interpreted as 'six years to save the planet',"" says Christopher Smith, a climate scientist at the University of Leeds and one of the authors. ""We do want to underline how close we are to 1.5 degrees [Celsius],"" says Smith. In order to have a better than 50% chance of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, humans would need to slash greenhouse gas emissions essentially to zero by around 2035, the study estimates. That is very unlikely. Even the most ambitious current plans to cut emissions wouldn't result innet zero emissionsbefore about 2050. But humans still have a lot of power to limit warming, the study underscores. That's because the 1.5 degrees Celsius target is not like a cliff, where humanity is safe on this side of it and doomed on the other. ""If we are able to limit warming to 1.6 degrees or 1.65 degrees or 1.7 degrees [Celsius], that's a lot better than 2 degrees [Celsius],"" says Smith. ""We still need to fight for every tenth of a degree."" The new estimates do suggest that humans have a little less wiggle room on carbon emissions than previous predictions. However, the six year prediction is still within the range of possibilities predicted by the latest United NationsIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, with which the new study shares both authors and methods. One reason for the slightly more dire estimate is air pollution. When fossil fuels are burned, they release other pollutants alongside carbon dioxide. Some of those pollutants – aerosols – cool off the Earth slightly. Scientists have known this about aerosols for a long time, but the best estimates of how much aerosols cool things off have slightly increased. That means, as air pollution decreases in the coming years, it could improve human health but will lead to slightly more warming."

One reason is that Via says his “climate anxiety” has been growing while he’s lived in the American West, in cities running out of water and whose air is frequently polluted by wildfire smoke or smog. When an earthquake struck Salt Lake City in March of 2020, Via and his wife, who grew up in Mexico City, decided they’d had enough, and embarked on a search for a place to settle where they wouldn’t have to worry about water or earthquakes or fires. Milwaukee ranked highly because it’s relatively immune to natural disasters, has access to a huge body of freshwater—Lake Michigan—has affordable houses for sale, and is diverse, which was important to the mixed-race couple. Now that they've moved, Via loves not having to worry about running out of water, not having to water his lawn because of Milwaukee's frequent rains, and being able to keep his window open for a good chunk of the year because he doesn't need air conditioning. Via knows most people still aren’t considering the climate when they move—states beset with blistering heat and hurricanes like Arizona and Florida are still gaining population, fast. But “I can’t wrap my head around not considering factors like, is there going to be water to drink in 30 years,” he says. “Or what’s going to be the average outdoor temperature? Or is the local government making the changes needed to protect the things needed for human life?” For decades, the Midwest has been a region left behind as manufacturing and other jobs dried up. Milwaukee County’s population has shrunk 12.3% in the last 50 years. Illinois has lost more than 2 million people since 2009. And while sunbelt states like Florida and Texas grew between 2020 and 2022, Illinois, Michigan and Ohioall lost population, according to the Council of State Governments. But some Midwestern leaders see their resilience to climate change as one means of reversing this decline. They’re putting their immunity from severe weather front and center, investing in making their cities more sustainable, and not shying away from the idea they can attract new residents like Via who are concerned about the climate. “As the climate continues to change and people make decisions about where they will move as individuals or where they will relocate or start businesses, folks will consider—do we want do it in a place that’s more likely to see intense hurricanes and storms year over year, a place that has earthquakes constantly, a place where it is unbearable to go outside for weeks or months?” Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson says. “Or do they want to do it in a place that’s more insulated from these things, like Milwaukee.” Similarly, the Citizens’ Research Council, a public policy group in Michigan, recently published areportsuggesting that climate migrants were one potential solution to the state’s declining population. Though Michigan has not historically prioritized its environment, the group argues, instead of putting industry first, focusing on natural resources could attract new residents and investments. Luring people to the Midwest will be a tall order—the region has been losing population for decades for reasons that are not changing overnight, including cold winters, lack of good jobs, and, in some states,high taxes. Leaders selling their locations as a safe place from climate change may not sway many people who are just looking for a warm and affordable place to live;86% of the 50 zip codesthat have seen the largest increase in new residents since 2020 were in Texas, Florida, and Arizona. Still, just about every list of the “best cities for climate change” include many Midwestern cities;Architectural Digesthas Milwaukee and Columbus, Ohio, in its top 10; Policygenius, an insurance platform, has Milwaukee, Columbus, and Minneapolis onits list. The top 10 list put together by Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Tulane University, almost exclusively consists of Midwest and Rust Belt cities, including Detroit, Duluth, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Buffalo, and Rochester in New York. Those aren’t the only cities that will benefit, Keenan says; many other places are benefiting from a change in preferences “but in general, people will be moving north and east.” Of course, climate change is not the only reason people pick where to live—people also seekjob opportunitiesand more affordable housing. Today, many young people are also looking for places that are affordable and that have embraced the kind of urban planning that makes it easy to walk or bike around town, says Keenan. Minneapolis, for instance, has transit-oriented development and mixed-income housing. East Lansing, Mich., has urban density, which is more climate-friendly than places where you have to get in your car to go anywhere. “A lot of these things were done in the name of sustainability and better urban planning and mitigating carbon footprint, but they’ve also been financially successful” in that they attracted new businesses and residents, he says. But climate change is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, according to the Site Selectors Guild, an association for consultants who help companies choose where to locate. Though factors like workforce availability and risk management are currently high among reasons that companies choose a certain place to locate, site selectors surveyed said that climate change, environment and sustainability would be the top motivator by 2032, according to theState of Site Selection 2022. Midwestern cities and states that have long seen nothing but people leaving are seizing on the opportunity to try and attract new residents and businesses. “Businesses in the Milwaukee region face a low risk of natural disasters, decreasing the risk to people and buildings,” bragsChoose Milwaukee, a website trying to attract businesses to the region sponsored by a regional economic development group. Buffalo will be “a climate refuge,” Buffalo Mayor Byron W. Brown said in his 2019 State of the City address; the city has since appointed aclimate action managerto lessen the city’s carbon footprint and prepare it for climate change. Michigan’s economic development website makes no secret that the state is “Ranked No. 1 Best for Climate Change” Milwaukee has portrayed itself as free from natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes, including on a PowerPoint it shows businesses considering relocating there, says Jim Paetsch, executive director of Milwaukee 7, the economic development group. It used to be that people would laugh when they saw the slide and ask why he didn’t include locusts or other Biblical plagues. “Nobody laughs anymore,” he says.

The 2020 Democratic National Convention was also held in Milwaukee. The signs these campaigns are working are currently more anecdotal than anything else. Johnson, the Milwaukee mayor, says he often hears from local real estate agents that many of their clientele have relocated from the west or places more prone to natural disasters. Intel chose the Columbus, Ohio region in January 2022 to invest $20 billion on at leasttwo leading-edge chip facilitiesto onshore production; the company will become the area’slargest water user.The number of data centers—the huge buildings housing servers and help keep the Internet running—has been growing more quickly in the Midwest because of the relatively low cost of real estate, availability of power, and low level of risk from natural disasters, says John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research Group. Population-wise, all that can really be said is that population losses are slowing in some Midwestern cities, including Milwaukee and Toledo, Ohio; some Midwestern cities, including Duluth, Minn., and Columbus, added population between July 2021 and 2022, according to data compiled by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. “The pandemic had a huge impact on migration patterns and the 2021-2022 data provide a hint of where and how revival will occur,” he says. Weather and affordability played a big role in Dianne Minardi and Dan Constable’s decision to move to Milwaukee from Atlanta. The couple, who both work remotely in higher education, had lived in Las Cruces, N.M., where it got so hot they would have to wake up at 6 am to walk their dog, and where there was always a fear of running out of water. When they moved to Atlanta, they thought they might stay there, but they quickly realized that they were nearly priced out of the market. Minardi also didn’t love the humidity and heat. “I just wanted to move somewhere where I can afford to live and the temperature is not going to force me to move again in my lifetime,” she says. Since they are both from Ohio, they looked into the Midwest and wanted a walkable city where they could have a lot of space to garden. A friend told them about Milwaukee and they bought a house over FaceTime, never having visited the city. They moved in January 2023 and love their house and neighborhood, a few short blocks from Lake Michigan, as well as the food scene and general friendliness of the city. Minardi says she’s glad they bought when they did. “My biggest concern was that everyone would move here and it would get too expensive for us to,” she says. For many Midwestern leaders, the hint of some reversal of population decline is enough to suggest that they need to invest more in sustainability, walkability, and the type of projects that will attract new residents. Milwaukee’s Mayor Johnson, for instance, wants to build a protected bike lane network across the city. Michigan’s Gov. Gretchen Whitmerhas unveiled plansto make Michigan generate all of its electricity from solar, wind, and other carbon-free sources by 2035. “I don’t think we can just say, as a state, ‘The south is going to boil and we can just rest and people will come here,’” Eric Lupher, president of the Citizens Research Council of Michigan. “We have to get the rest of our ducks in a row, so to speak, try to be better at trying to attract more companies.” Indeed, for Via and some other Midwestern migrants, the fact that some Midwestern local governments appear invested in preparing for climate change is appealing. Milwaukee is trying to remove highways and make its downtown more walkable, he says, while places like Salt Lake City and Phoenix seem to be ignoring the challenges that lay ahead. “I was tired of living in places that made sense when there was 100,000 people living there but that no longer made sense when there were millions of people—and nobody talking about it or doing anything about it.”"

This led to the discovery that this clumping, or aggregation, of clouds can affect the Earth's climate in multiple ways that were not previously understood.The research, titled ""The Influence of Convective Aggregation on the Stable Isotopic Composition of Water Vapor,"" was recently published inAGU Advances.""It's a new group of datasets, and this was the first time we were able to bring all these different techniques to bear on the interesting problem of howcloudsclump together and how that clumping can affect climate,"" said University of New Mexico's Department Earth & Planetary Sciences Professor Joseph Galewsky. This research was conducted while Galewsky was on sabbatical in France at the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique (LMD) in Paris.The idea that thunderstorms can aggregate has been known for decades, but the impacts onwater vaporand the use of stable isotopes in water vapor to track these processes are quite new. There is evidence that the clumping of clouds has a surprisingly large impact on climate.In this research, the team of international scientists used remote sensing data to investigate how the organization of clouds affects the chemistry of water vapor in the atmosphere. These clouds can range from individual cells to larger systems like tropical cyclones. The study focused on the global tropics from 2015 to 2020.One of the key discoveries of the research was that cloud organization impacts the distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere. They found that when clouds are not organized (unaggregated), the atmosphere tends to have more moisture but that the water vapor is relatively depleted in deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. This suggests that evaporation from rain contributes to this pattern.""Water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas, actually the most importantgreenhouse gas, and the stable isotopes in water vapor help us to track the processes that govern the distribution of water vapor. What we found was that in regions where thunderstorms are not organized, meaning that the clouds are isolated and look sort of like popcorn, the atmosphere tends to be quite moist,"" said Galewsky.In cases of organized (aggregated) convection, there is less moisture in the atmosphere, but the water vapor is more enriched in deuterium. This implies more transport of water vapor from near the Earth's surface into the upper parts of the atmosphere.""When the clouds are very tightly bundled together, the atmosphere tends to be a lot drier and the water vapor is more is more isotopically enriched, meaning that there's water vapor coming from the boundary layer, the lowest parts of the atmosphere, into the middle atmosphere,"" Galewsky explained.Lastly, they discovered that when convective clouds are moderately organized (intermediate aggregation), there is no significant variation in water vapor isotopic composition.""It gives insight into how this clumping of storms affects the current climate through radiative processes linked to variations in humidity. It also potentially helps us to better understand past climates because the isotopes in water vapor are often recorded in things like cave formations or ice cores,"" Galewsky said.The findings may help in the interpretation of paleoclimate records because past changes in convective cloud organization could lead to isotopic signals that have not been recognized in past research. This is vital for understanding ancient climate variations.""What we found is that the way these clouds are organized can have a big impact on water vapor in the atmosphere. And that is important because it can influence how the earth is able to cool itself off, which has obvious implications forclimate change,"" said Galewsky.This research helps bridge the gap betweentheoretical modelsand real-world observations, allowing the researchers to better understand the complex interactions within the atmosphere. ""People who've been studying convective aggregation have been calling for isotope studies for a long time, and we were the first group to actually be able to pull it off,"" said Galewsky. This will help provide better observational constraints for climate models. The results of this research can help provide new ways for climate modelers to test that their models are working correctly.""Theatmosphereis currently warming, and the evidence is overwhelming that that's due to the burning of fossil fuels. And while the basic physics of climate change is very well understood and has been well understood for more than a century at this point, there are a lot of details that we still don't understand well; in particular, probably the biggest uncertainty in our projection of future climate has to do with clouds and how they affect climate,"" explained Galewsky,""This is a new way of trying to get at this most important uncertainty in climate projections for the future and for New Mexico. This research will help to better constrain those future studies."""

There are hopes the goal will be met this year.""Old promises must be kept, including the $100 billion pledge made over a decade ago,"" Jaber said on Sunday.Last year's COP27 talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, ended with the first ever creation of a ""loss and damage"" fund into which countries would pay to support poorer nations suffering the most from more intense and frequent storms, floods and droughts.The fund's operation, governance, location, contributors, beneficiaries and a timeline for payouts are all up in the air ahead of COP28.""We must make the fund for loss and damage that was promised in Sharm el-Sheikh a reality in Dubai,"" Jaber said.Climate 'crossroads'The talks in Riyadh are intended to ""shine a spotlight on challenges and solutions in a region that is among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change,"" organizers said in a press release on Sunday.The region must already grapple with high temperatures andwater scarcity, with more than 60 percent of the population having ""very little if any access to potable water"", the statement said.""Increasing temperatures are predicted to lead to more persistent and acute drought,"" it added.Jaber also highlighted challenges facing the region, referring toextreme eventslike hurricane-strength Storm Daniel, which last month caused two dams in eastern Libya to burst and flood the city of Derna.""Climate change isn't a threat waiting around the corner—the MENA region knows this from first-hand experience with fierce heat waves and water shortages,"" said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme.Simon Stiell, executive secretary of UN Climate Change, said the region was ""at a crossroads, facing not only the devastating impacts ofclimate changebut also the challenge of transitioning their economies to ensure prosperity in a 1.5C aligned world.""The goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels was set at the 2015climate talksin Paris."

National security is no exception. TheNational Intelligence Council has foundthat ""climate change will increasingly exacerbate risks to U.S. national security interests as the physical impacts increase and geopolitical tensions mount about how to respond to the challenge.""The U.S. Defense Department recognizes that climate change is a ""threat multiplier"" as it exacerbates existing environmental stresses andsecurity risks. In a2021 Department of Defensereport, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that almost everything the U.S. Defense Department (DOD) does to defend the American people is jeopardized by climate change—the department's strategies, plans, capabilities, missions, and equipment—and the risks are growing, especially since the world is not on track to meet its Paris Agreement goals. The risks lie not only within U.S. borders; our partner countries impacted by climate change affect American national security interests as well, he said.Jason Bordoff, director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, goes further. ""DOD and the wider national security community need to broaden their definition of 'climate risk,'"" he said. ""There's been plenty of analysis conducted on the exposure and risk to military infrastructure from rising sea level, storms, etc., but there will also be less direct impacts of climate change, such as competition over critical minerals or political instability in resource-rich nations as fossil fuel use eventually dwindles.""Here is a look at the national security challenges posed by climate change.Direct threatsInfrastructureSea-level rise andextreme weatherare affecting both the military's infrastructure and its supply chains. Installations and facilities near coasts are eroding and flooding.In 2013, Fort Irwin in California experienced flash flooding that cost over $65 million in damages. In Virginia, the Norfolk Naval Station, the world's largest naval base, experiences routine flooding during rainstorms and high tides. This impacts the Navy's ability to conduct operations in the Atlantic Ocean, and hampers its work on ships and submarines in the shipyard. U.S.military baseson Guam and the Marshall Islands are also vulnerable tosea-level rise. Damage from 2018's Hurricane Michael shut down Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida for months; rebuilding it was estimated to cost $3.6 billion. Rising temperatures and extreme precipitation at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri can prevent stealth nuclear bombers from taking off.Global supply chains are also disrupted by extreme weather, which may hinder the military's ability to access critical supplies. Technology sectors such as artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, and semiconductors are essential to U.S. national security. But in 2021, severe flooding in Malaysia, a major hub for semiconductor assembly and packaging, disrupted the supply chain, contributing to a global semiconductor shortage.Extreme weather makes outdoor training and military exercises difficult and can affect the maintenance and effectiveness of weapons systems and other equipment. This means existing and new equipment will need to be redesigned to enable it to operate in all climate conditions. Weather conditions can also limit the amount of land available for training and reduce water supplies. Heat waves and other extreme weather can decrease personnel productivity and impact military members' health.Demand for military resourcesThe physical impacts of climate change increase the frequency, scale, and complexity of defense operations and make them more costly.Because natural disasters are increasing, the military is being called on more frequently as first responders for disaster and humanitarian relief and must respond to situations beyond their usual scope. For example, between 2016 and 2021, the number of National Guard personnel days spent fighting wildfires increased by 162,000 as droughts have lengthened fire seasons. During Hurricane Sandy, the DOD helped distribute 6.2 million meals, 7.8 million gallons of fuel, medical supplies, and other staples.Indirect threatsDisplacement and civil unrestClimate change also affects food and water security, degrades the environment, increases the spread of diseases, and disrupts essential services like electricity production. These impacts can drive migration. One study found that if we continue our fossil fuel use trajectory, the probability of multiple simultaneous droughts could increase from the late 20th century average by 40 percent by 2050 and 60 percent by late century.These droughts could potentially affect 120 million people around the world, triggering crop failures, threatening water supplies, and forcing people to migrate. The World Bank has warned that 143 million people particularly in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America could end up migrating due to climate impacts.As migrants enter countries or regions unprepared to deal with them, tensions rise. As we already see on the U.S. southern border, migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Venezuela, and other nations fleeing poverty, violence, and extreme weather are causing enormous political turmoil.Climate impacts contribute to poverty, social inequality, political instability, and violence. Weak governments have trouble meeting their people's basic needs, so civil unrest increases. These conditions can lead to shifts in the regional balance of power or result in the failure of states. In some of these cases, the U.S. military may be called upon to come to the aid of its partners to restore stability.Joshua Fisher, director of the Advanced Consortium on Cooperation, Conflict, and Complexity at Columbia Climate School, said that most of the conflicts he sees in the world are not directly driven by climate change.""What climate change is doing is impacting already vulnerable societies,"" he said. ""So if there are tensions, if there are large sectors of the population who are marginalized, by and large those same sectors of society are going to be impacted disproportionately by climate change. This opens up a mechanism where climate change can further marginalize and harm already vulnerable people. And that can be the mechanism that leads to increased conflict.""Conflicts around decarbonizationAccording to aNational Intelligence Council report, tensions are also likely to grow as countries argue about how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Paris Agreement goals. The conflict will be about which countries bear more responsibility to act and to pay, due to their historic emissions.""As pressure to decarbonize increases, you can expect more animosity between the developed and developing worlds as poorer countries wonder, rightly so, why the richer countries, who have created the climate crisis in the first place, are now asking them to limit their consumption of fossil fuels,"" said Bordoff.Developing countries will continue to demand more money from developed countries, which have failed to mobilize the promised $100 billion a year by 2020. The UN estimates that developing countries will need at least $300 billion per year by 2030 just for adaptation. Meanwhile, countries that rely on fossil fuels to support their economies see theenergy transitionas a threat and are attempting to slow progress towards decarbonization.""The pressure of the energy transition may, if not managed carefully, increase geopolitical tensions, creating new risks to energy security,"" said Bordoff. ""Many of these tensions will be seen in who is wielding influence in the emerging clean energy economy, and who the winners and losers are in a shrinking fossil fuel economy.""Competition for resourcesEfforts to achieve decarbonization will hasten the race to secure resources. For instance, as countries try to reduce their own vulnerability by becoming greener and more energy self-sufficient, the demand for rare minerals for batteries and solar panels will increase. According to Bordoff, to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, the demand for critical minerals will go up sixfold. Competition between countries to acquire and process the minerals needed for renewable energy technologies could result in conflict.""One example of this is a recent rift in the U.S.-E.U. relationship, where we've seen historical allies at odds over perceived unfair protectionism in new clean energy investments,"" said Bordoff. ""Another is the heightened tensions between China and the West with regards to critical minerals, batteries, orsolar panels, with Western leaders concerned about China's dominance over the production of clean energy and the potential weaponization of this market dominance. The longer the world takes to get to net zero, the worse these problems will get.""The ArcticThe melting Arctic ice is opening up the Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.This could lead tocompetitionfor sea lanes for commercial shipping between the United States, Russia, China, and Canada. Countries are also vying for the region's unclaimed land, fish, natural gas, minerals, and other resources.Most legal matters in the region are determined by the Arctic Council, which is made up of the United States, Russia, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. Other countries, such as China, Germany, and India, are considered observer countries. Because the Arctic Council's resolutions are nonbinding, however, it has no enforcement power. Consequently, as military and commercial activity in the region grows, so too could the risk of miscalculation and conflict.GeoengineeringThe U.S. intelligence community is alsoincreasingly concernedabout geoengineering, which is now being discussed more often as a viable option for dealing with climate change. This is particularly the case with solar geoengineering, which involves sending reflective sulfur dioxide particles into the atmosphere to reflect solar radiation away from Earth and imitate the cooling effect of a volcanic eruption.Research on geoengineering is being done around the world, particularly in the United States, China, and India. As there is currently no international governance for geoengineering, it's conceivable that in the future, a single country suffering from climate impacts could decide to conduct geoengineering on its own. This could cause weather patterns around the world to shift, disrupt monsoons, degrade the ozone layer, or trigger droughts that affect agriculture; it could also be weaponized. This could exacerbate tensions between countries or even lead to war.What the military is doingIt is now DOD policy to consider climate change in all its operations, activities, business processes, decision making, and resource allocation to ensure that military forces continue to be capable and effective.The DOD isinvesting $3.6 billionto enhance the resilience of its infrastructure, improve its energy and water capacities, and modernize its operations.This includes funding for microgrids, energy storage, and renewable energy, electric vehicles, and charging installations. $106 million will be used to improve the energy efficiency of operations. $1.3 billion will be invested into research and development in cutting-edge technology and prototypes of new conveyances. $54 million will go toward incorporating climate impacts into war games and exercises to ensure that the military can operate in all conditions.""In a warming climate, you're going to see rising seas threaten critical infrastructure, growing geopolitical tensions, larger flows of migration away from the most climate-vulnerable nations, civil conflict driven by resource scarcity, and new venues for conflict,"" said Bordoff. ""Each one of these by themselves would be worrying, but having them play out simultaneously will cause not only a drain on limited resources to counteract them, but will exacerbate today's worsening geopolitical trends.""He added, ""Military leaders need to devote more attention to some of these more complex consequences of climate change so that they can better prepare for them.""The DOD is one of the only organizations in the world with the ability to move materials anywhere around the world in 24 hours, according to Fisher. ""And so understanding the national security interest we have in preventing conflicts from escalating into outright violence should be one of the DOD's priorities,"" he said.The DOD should look at areas that are vulnerable toclimatechange, as well as at near- and mid-term forecasts for risks in various regions. ""They should utilize the resources they have to prevent conflict, not with military action, but rather by supporting rule of law programs or emergency support, or providing provisions, to try to prevent conflicts from escalating.""Fisher has been impressed with the DOD's handling of the topic ofclimate change. ""The DOD has been able to be frank and sober about it, but understand that it is anational securitythreat, and treat it as such, rather than getting mired in the politics of it,"" he said. ""The more they can maintain that focus, the better I think they'll be.""Provided by State of the PlanetThis story is republished courtesy of Earth Institute, Columbia Universityhttp://blogs.ei.columbia.edu.Citation: Why climate change is a national security risk (2023, October 11) retrieved 3 November 2023 "

Record flooding in and around Houston produced ""mini extinctions"" of insects and other species in areas that remained inundated for 10 or more days.Study lead author Mattheau Comerford, Egan and co-authors Scott Carroll and Tatum La discovered evolution played out across space rather than time when the insect species Jadera haematoloma recolonized flooded areas.Comerford, a former graduate student in Egan's lab, is now a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Carroll is a biologist at the University of California, Davis, and La is a Stanford University undergraduate and former high school intern in Egan's research group.The researchers showed that in the wake of the storm, a form of evolution called spatial sorting exerted a greater influence on the evolution of J. haematoloma, commonly known as the red-shouldered soapberry bug, than did natural selection.Red-shouldered soapberry bugs . Credit: Mattheau Comerford""This is an understudied and underappreciated form of evolutionary change that has emerged from the invasive species literature,"" Egan said of spatial sorting. ""For example, cane toads in Australia have exhibited these patterns. And up until the last decade or two, spatial sorting has not really been considered a significant form of evolutionary change.""Natural selection and spatial sorting each change the likelihood that specific traits will be passed to future generations. With natural selection, change plays out over decades or even millennia as traits become more common or less common depending on which individuals survive and reproduce. With spatial sorting, change occurs when species move into new territory, and traits become more common or less common depending on which individuals are at the leading edge of range expansion.""If everybody is moving at different rates, the ones that move the fastest will always tend to end up at a higher density at the range edge,"" Egan said. ""So right at that range edge, you have just a subpopulation of the fastest dispersers. And when they mate, there's a tendency for them to have even faster dispersing offspring. So there's this kind of accumulative, increasing rate of dispersal as the range front moves outward.""Prior to Harvey, Comerford spent about 10 months gathering field data about soapberry bugs at 15 sites around the Houston metropolitan area. Native to Texas and the southwestern United States, the bugs are a textbook example of rapid evolution. They feed on seeds by plunging needle-like beaks deep into the fruit of their host plants.When the goldenrain tree was widely introduced in the United States as an ornamental plant after World War II, it proved an opportune host for soapberry bugs. The trees' seeds are not as deep as those of the soapberry's native host plants, and the bugs rapidly evolved shorter beaks to access them. Through decades of study, Carroll and others have shown this is one of the fastest recorded examples of ecological adaptation.Southeast Texas is one of the few places in the United States where short-beaked soapberry bugs coexist alongside two native varieties with longer beaks that are adapted to the seed depths of their host plants.Credit: Mattheau ComerfordAt field sites, Comerford sampled soapberry bugs from the three host plants every two weeks. Prior to the storm, the bugs found on each host were the varieties whose beaks were adapted to match the host's seeds. This was expected, given the ""extremely strong selective pressure to rapidly adapt beak length to suit the seed pods of whatever host plant they are living on,"" he said.Harvey flooded 11 of the research team's 15 sites. At non-flooded sites, the three varieties of soapberry bugs continued to thrive. At flooded sites, Comerford found soapberry bugs began returning within three months, but only bugs with longer wings reached these sites. It took more than two years for all the sites to be recolonized by the long-winged bugs.""Looking at our data and past publications, we saw that beak length and wing length were genetically linked, meaning insects with longer wings also had longer beaks,"" Comerford said. ""So now that we had better dispersers driving spatial sorting, they were dragging along these other traits, the longer beaks, that had nothing to do with dispersal.""The persistence of long-winged, long-beaked individuals on all of the host plants at the recolonized sites showed ""spatial sorting was having an effect that was much stronger than the effect of natural selection in that moment,"" Comerford said. ""That is completely novel in this experiment.""Egan said the study demonstrates the significance of spatial sorting, because similar scenarios could play out after many types of climate catastrophes, including wildfires, droughts, heat waves and winter storms.""All these episodic types of events are predicted to increase in frequency and magnitude in the coming years,"" Egan said. ""As populations move in response to these events, and as they are moving poleward to get into the envelope to which they are adapted, they're going to be subject to spatial sorting.""Comerford said, ""The hallmark of the Anthropocene, and all of the changes that we're seeing with the environment, is that the ability to move and migrate to new locations that are more hospitable is critical for the survival of organisms. This study shows there is a force out there that we haven't been accounting for that could make a huge difference in the survival and evolutionary change of organisms on the move. We need to be cognizant of its potential, because this is a phenomenon that is probably going to come into play more as events unfold."""

But now thanks to the power of the JWST, scientists can not only view a never-before-seen atmospheric jet stream but also detect just how fast it's moving. The 3,000-mile-wide high-speed jet stream, which sits near Jupiter's equator and above its primary cloud range, is moving around the gassy planet at 320 miles per hour, according to NASA. ""This is something that totally surprised us,"" Ricardo Hueso, a lead author on the paper describing NASA's findings, said in the press release. ""What we have always seen as blurred hazes in Jupiter's atmosphere now appear as crisp features that we can track along with the planet's fast rotation."" The jet stream's speed is twice as fast as the strongest Category 5 hurricanes on Earth. The JWST was only able to detect the jet stream when it looked at a particular band of infrared light, which revealed changes in atmospheric features at varying altitudes. By comparing the speeds of high-altitude winds with the speeds of those at lower altitudes, NASA said its team was able to measure how altitude affects the speed of the planet's winds. The find is the latest by the powerful new James Webb telescope since it began operations about a year ago and started spotting hidden details in the sky."

Last year, the telescope captured astunning image of Jupiteras seen in the infrared wavelength, and now scientists who have been working on this data have published some of their findings about the planet — including a brand-new feature that they identified in its atmosphere. Jupiter’s atmosphere is adramatic, turbulent place, with epic storms like the famous Great Red Spot, which is a storm stretching over 200 miles wide. But the researchers also identified a new feature there — a high-speed jet stream that is an incredible 3,000 miles wide and located over the planet’s equator. This jet stream is high up in the atmosphere, above the main cloud layer, and was visible in the data taken with Webb’s NIRCam instrument. “This is something that totally surprised us,” said lead researcher Ricardo Hueso of Spain’s University of the Basque Country in astatement. “What we have always seen as blurred hazes in Jupiter’s atmosphere now appear as crisp features that we can track along with the planet’s fast rotation.” Webb’s near-infrared instruments are ideal for looking at the upper layers of Jupiter’s atmosphere, and are accurate enough to resolve the blurry haze into clearer details. By tracking the movement of small clouds, the researchers could calculate the speed of the jet stream. That showed the jet stream moves at a speed of 320 mph, or around twice the wind speed of a Category 5 hurricane. Researchers want to observe the jet stream over the next few years to see if its speed is related to the pattern of winds and temperatures seen in the planet’s stratosphere above the equator. “It’s amazing to me that, after years of tracking Jupiter’s clouds and winds from numerous observatories, we still have more to learn about Jupiter, and features like this jet can remain hidden from view until these new NIRCam images were taken in 2022,” said team member Leigh Fletcher of England’s University of Leicester. The research is published in the journalNature Astronomy."

Now, the honor of hosting the American debut goes to the Hamptons International Film Festival this Friday, where the documentary screens as the festival Centerpiece (Simon will appear in person there for a conversation moderated by Rolling Stone’s David Fear). On Sunday, the film plays across the pond at the BFI London Film Festival.Related StoriesBreaking News'Three Promises,' 'Queendom,' 'Knit's Island' Win Prizes As Camden International Film Festival Wraps 19th EditionBreaking NewsA Storm Forestalls U.S. Premiere Of 'A Storm Foretold,' Doc About Roger Stone And January 6 Insurrection - Camden Int'l Film Festival During what was supposed to be Gibney’s Camden premiere, I stopped by the hotel where the filmmaker was staying to talk about his exploration of one of America’s greatest singer-songwriters. A documentary about Paul Simon may sound like a thematic departure for him – after all, Gibney has become renowned for his cinematic exposés: On the Bush administration’s torture policies (the Oscar-winningTaxi to the Dark Side), the Church of Scientology (Going Clear), and Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes (The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley), among many others. But he reminds me, “This would be the fifth film, really, I’ve done about music… I did a film about James Brown, did a film about Fela Kuti, and did a film about Frank Sinatra. So, I’ve kind of been invested in that.” He adds, “My wife will tell you that I’m not much of a singer, but maybe for that reason I’ve always been really interested in the music-making process.” For a filmmaker intrigued by that process, he couldn’t have hoped for a better subject than Simon, whose body of work encompasses an incredible list of classics: “Bridge Over Troubled Waters,” “The Sound of Silence,” “Mrs. Robinson,” “The Boxer,” “Mother and Child Reunion,” “Kodachrome,” “Graceland,” and “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes,” to name only a few. “I’ve gotten comments from people who’ve watched the film who are like, ‘Whoa, I didn’t realize he wrote all those songs,’” Gibney shares. “Now, particularly younger folks are like, you hear it all around you, you recognize the songs and then you don’t think, oh, there’s another Paul Simon song.” The film charts a career in music that began when Simon was in his teens, the long association with Art Garfunkel — Simon’s childhood friend and neighbor growing up in New York — their breakthrough with “The Sound of Silence” (which became a hit after producer Tom Wilson reworked the original recording with electric guitar and drums), and Simon’s stunning solo work. But it’s very much a present-tense film, constructed around the recording of the artist’s new album,Seven Psalms. “[Paul] had reached out to me, he had seen the Sinatra film and wondered if I might be interested in doing a film about his overall career. And of course, I was interested in that,” Gibney recalls. “But the gift was when he called me up and said, ‘I’m making thisnewalbum. Would you like to come watch me make it?’ And that was a gift because it was him in the present working on something. I could see him working on it. And also because it’s a meditation on belief and life and death, it seemed appropriate to move back and forth in time to earlier moments in his career.” Gibney headed down to Simon’s hacienda outside Austin, Texas, where he recorded the album (mostly in an “Old West”-type structure with a sign hanging out front that reads “Sheriff”). In the film, there are intermittent appearances by Simon’s wife, the singer-songwriter Edie Brickell; his friend, the jazz great Wynton Marsalis, and a choral group from Europe. Often, it shows him experimenting with sound, trying to come up with as near an approximation as possible to what he hears in his head. “He’s really into shaping sound,” Gibney explains, “and also really into just what is the right sound, how does it move and shape around the rest of the music?” In Restless Dreamsshows Simon, who turns 82 next week, coping with the sudden loss of hearing in one ear, a potentially devastating development “that was so difficult for him because he’s very much invested in the space of sound. And so where do you place the voice? Where do you place the other instruments? How do you hear them? And that becomes harder to do when you’re not hearing in stereo.” In the documentary, Simon tells the filmmaker he fell into a depression after suffering the hearing loss, but rebounded after concluding that perhaps he was meant to struggle through such a difficult time. “Maybe that’s what this album is about,” Gibney characterizes Simon as thinking, “to lean into the idea that the experience of what he’s going through is part of what needs to be expressed on the album.” At 209 minutes,In Restless Dreamsoffers audiences a deep sonic dive into Simon’s music – the new work and what came earlier: The thrilling Brazilian percussion of “Obvious Child,” the thrumming rhythm of “Graceland” and its graceful lyrics “…The Mississippi Delta was shining like a National Guitar…,” the thunderous boom of “The Boxer” (drums recorded in an elevator shaft), the emotional catharsis of “Bridge Over Troubled Waters” (in versions recorded by Simon & Garfunkel and Aretha Franklin). “It does soar and it really gets inside you,” Gibney says of Simon’s music. “It’s like it gets in your lungs and suddenly you’re breathing it.” In Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simonheld its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. Gibney is weighing various distribution options. “We’re talking to a bunch of people now, and it’s exciting, the response,” he tells Deadline. “Interestingly, one of the areas of very positive response is theatrical, which I think came out of how audiences received it at Toronto.” Gibney adds, “It’s a nervous making moment for a director to drop a three-and-a-half-hour film in front of a live audience for the first time, but they received it well… It appears that there’s a lot of enthusiasm for the film, as we had hoped, but you never know. But yeah, there’s a lot of enthusiasm.”"

While Beyoncé flies in a private jet, Filkins Drift have walked around Wales, performing almost 50 gigs. After hiking through two named storms, Chris Roberts and Seth Bye finish their 60-day tour in Chepstow, Monmouthshire, on Tuesday. They said the music industry has to change its ""mindset"" on sustainability. The subject of how musicians tour hit the headlines in the summer when Beyoncé arrived for a gig in Cardiff by private jet, while Coldplay's Chris Martin took the train to the city a few weeks later. Chris Roberts, from Cardiff, said: ""We're not at all suggesting that everyone should give up driving and walk to all their gigs because it has completely taken over our lives, but things like choosing more sustainable routes (should be considered)."" The guitar player said the 27-year-olds had discovered ""how little stuff"" they need to gig, each carrying a 15kg (33lb) bag. Seth, from Gloucestershire, said: ""I've got kind of a medium-sized backpack and using an elaborate system of carabiners, my fiddle is strapped to the back of a bag, and I've also got the mic. ""Chris has got his sort of massive guitar, which has got various bag straps on the outside of it and clothes stuffed in with the guitar."" The duo began their walk in Flintshire on 3 September, travelling through counties including Gwynedd, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Swansea and Bridgend. After more than 45 gigs and 60 days, the journey is set to finish in Chepstow, with Chris adding: ""It's been mad because we've got a set of clothes that we walk in and one we do a gig in."" They said it has changed the way they plan to gig in the future, although it will probably be more focused on public transport than hiking. The pair came up with the walking tour idea after lockdown. Seth said when they began gigging again, their time was mostly ""spent in a car stuck in a traffic jam, which isn't very good for the environment, or mental and physical health"". ""We were just wondering whether there was a better way to tour,"" he said. They were inspired by old Bardic traditions, said Chris: ""Walking like this isn't a new idea, it's something that has just been forgotten. ""This is actually how people used to work for years and years, especially around Wales, along the coast."" The guitarist said planning felt like a ""massive puzzle"" because they had to find venues every 15 miles (24km). ""Fortunately, almost every single village on the coast of Wales has either a chapel, a pub - or both,"" he said. However they had to get creative in some areas, with places such as Llanelli Wetland Centre putting on a gig for the first time. Chris said another aspect of their tour has been to bring live music to communities and places that do not often have access. ""We're raising money for a charity called Live Music Now, who bring music to people who can't come out to conventional concerts - so care homes and special needs schools and hospitals and things like that,"" he said. In the two months the pair have been walking, two named storms hit the UK. Seth said: ""We've been ridiculously lucky with the weather - Storm Agnes was meant to hit us but completely missed. ""It's been phenomenal - we've had days where we finish the walk and get to the venue and then it just starts tipping it down."" They said there was one day, where they were hiking Yr Eifl, a group of hills on the north coast of the Llŷn Peninsula in Gwynedd, where they got ""absolutely drenched"". ""Neither of us had quite figured out the waterproofing strategies for the bags - various waterproof covers secured with shoelaces and duct tape,"" Seth said. They also managed to avoid the worst of Storm Babet. People would call ""out of the blue"" to offer their home for the night. Seth said, despite having walked for two months, they have had ""no blisters, no aches and pains"" despite the fact they had ""not actually trained"" for the journey. ""We walk all day, we have an hour for food, and then we do a gig, it's just back to back - to start with it felt incredibly daunting, but now we have just settled into the natural rhythm of life,"" he said."

With the destabilizing effects of the climate crisis, coupled with sea level rise, these record-breaking disasters are quickly becoming normal occurrences. Communities need to build resilience quickly, and UConn researchers are working on a metric to help coastal areas prioritize which measures to focus on. Their research is published in theInternational Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction.Co-author and Associate Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Wei Zhang says Sandy actually brought him to UConn.Following the storm, there was an effort to recruit researchers to focus on resilience and engineering for natural hazards, and with a background in bridge and offshore platform engineering, Zhang, who now leads the Damage Modeling and Disaster Mitigation Lab and is affiliated with the Connecticut Institute for Resilience & Climate Adaptation (CIRCA), came to UConn not realizing that storms as strong as Sandy were a risk for the Northeast.""My research covers a large spectrum, focusing on the uncertainties of how natural hazards interact with different kinds of infrastructures like bridges, buildings, low residential buildings, andelectrical infrastructure,"" Zhang says.""In this paper, we focused on what we call livability. We havenatural hazardsthat interact with different components of civil infrastructures in our community and we want to know how the residents will be impacted, whether they're going to be okay, or they're going to suffer, and how much they're going to suffer.""Zhang explains that it is important for people to know if they are likely to be without power or water, or whether they'll be able to use roads to get supplies or go to the hospital. This information is vital for planning and for shoring up community infrastructure and individual households.To study these details, Zhang and his team created a ""livability index"" that incorporates factors influencing the lives of members of the community. The creation of the index relied on researchers from many different research areas because communities are dynamic and understanding the dynamics required a range of expertise, Zhang says.""We worked with experts from many disciplines. For instance, geography researchers who work with GIS (Geographic Information System) data, and statisticians and mathematicians on data analysis and quantification. We're also working withcomputer scienceand electrical engineering researchers to understand how the electrical system operates and how we can use machine learning and deep learning to quickly understand infrastructure performance to integrate those together.""""Of course, environmental modeling for big-scale atmospheric modeling and social sciences to understand how people perceive hazards. There is a lot of collaborative work from different disciplines.""Preparing for a future of intense stormsThe researchers try to account for what will happen if another Superstorm Sandy impacts a community, except the model is calibrated to the more extreme climatic conditions projected for 2100, under two different emissions projections or representative concentration pathways (RCPs). They ran scenarios for acase study, looking at the impacts of hazards and benefits of potential adaptative measures.""We looked at scenarios and different hazards and asked questions like would you rather be without electricity, without water, without heat, or without transportation?"" says Zhang. ""It may be different for different households because people have different preferences. The idea is to understand not only how infrastructure is affected but also by how the individual households are going to perceive these hazards.""Using this information coupled with a future of more intense weather, Zhang says towns can decide which projects to prioritize. For instance, if a road should be repaved, if a pump station should be installed in a flood-prone area, or if an evacuation plan needs to be developed.""With limited resources, how do we prioritize the action items the community undertakes? We all pay taxes, and we want to help the whole community make decisions that will do the most to prevent as much damage as possible for the community. We're trying to understand these dynamics.""In the case of evacuation, the index also accounts for what condition houses will be in post-disaster, including the extent of the damage, what repairs can be expected, and other factors to consider for a quick recovery.""We may have more snowstorms or more hurricanes, some may be more extreme, but some years they might not happen at all because there is more uncertainty. What do you want to spend to calm your nerves about the uncertainties in front of you?"" asks Zhang.Each community has unique needs, resources, and experiencesAnother layer of the livability index is optimization, says Zhang. The researchers try to account for human perception and psychology, as well as social effects so they can better understand how people will perceive the risks.""Let's say a group of people are okay to be without power for a few days, but they would not want to be without water,"" says Zhang. ""If we have that information, then we know that's what we should focus on. If we only have $100 million to make this community strong, then we can expect the next time we're going to have certain minor power outages, of course we can't fix everything, but this information can help to prioritize in a way that makes sense.""Zhang says he always tries to work directly with communities because each is unique with its own history, challenges, and budget considerations. Since a single solution won't work for each community, a challenge is to design the livability index in such a way that it can be applied to any community,""It comes down to what is called 'good enough,' and that 'enough' concept is very challenging. The problem is how to support the work that needs to be done. If we can establish that with this index, then we hope that every town will be able to easily access and transfer the information to fit their needs,"" says Zhang. ""We're trying to solve the problem and help people live better.""The livability index helps identify a starting point, and Zhang says the next step will be working with more coastal municipalities to begin applying the index and answering this question. It is a big task, and the process is not easy especially, as Zhang points out, because attention to the climate crisis and how people perceive the hazards associated with it may change how things are handled.""No matter what experts tell people, these disasters might happen or not, but once they do happen or people realize they can happen, it may be easier to prepare. We cannot blame them; this is their life experience, and we shouldn't challenge that. But certain extremes are happening and it's beyond what you can see in the past and it could change how people perceive these measures,"" says Zhang.""They need to believe the science; they need to trust experts to see what we have done. We need to show the facts and the livability index helps with this."""

Powerful winds and rain are already lashing southern England and gusts of up to 95mph (152km/h) are expected to hit the Channel Islands. The Met Office has warned of travel disruption and damage to buildings, prompting the declaration of a major incident in Hampshire. There are also 33 flood warnings in place across England. A red wind warning, the highest level, has been issued by Jersey Met for Wednesday night into Thursday. Storm-force gusts, heavy rainfall and coastal flooding are expected in the Channel Islands, where conditions could be some of the worst seen in decades and flood defence measures have been put in place. Yellow and amber warnings for wind and rain - indicating potential risks to life and property - have been issued by the Met Office for parts of England and Scotland. An amber warning of wind has been issued for South West England from 03:00 GMT to 11:00 on Thursday, and for the East of England and the South East from 06:00 to 17:00 on Thursday. Heavy rain was pushing into parts of Cornwall and Devon on Wednesday evening. The Met Office said there was some uncertainty around the path of the storm, but the ""greatest impacts (are) likely along the south coast"". The Met Office says the UK has provisionally recorded the joint-sixth wettest October on record, after the heavy rain brought by Storm Babet. Eastern Scotland had its wettest October since records began in 1836, with 82% more rain than its average. Gusts are likely to reach 70-80mph (113-129 km/h) in some coastal areas in southern England, and in a few coastal spots may exceed 85mph (123 km/h). And20-30mm of rain is expected in southern and western areas. Other key developments include: The power of the storm is created by a phenomenon known as explosive cyclogenesis - sometimes dubbed a ""bomb cyclone"" - where an area of low pressure rapidly deepens and strengthens, causing the weather system to violently rotate. The amber warnings for wind could cause structural damage, the Met Office warned. It said gusts could blow off roofs, bring down powerlines and disrupt transport routes. Flying debris could be a danger to life, it said, and there is the potential for large waves and beach material being thrown onto coastal roads. There are also yellow warnings for rain for eastern England, London, the South East, South West, North West, West Midlands and Wales from 18:00 on Wednesday. And yellow warnings for wind are in place for the East of England, London, South East, South West and Wales from 21:00 on Wednesday to 23:59 on Thursday. In Scotland, a yellow warning for rain has been issued for the south west and Lothian Borders from 06:00 Thursday to 06:00 Friday. An earlier warning for rain in Northern Ireland has been cancelled but the region has already seen some flooding. East Devon District Council said a temporary barrier of sand and a fabric membrane were being put in place to reduce the impact of waves from the storm. With trees still in full leaf and the ground already saturated, Devon County Council said there was a high chance that there would be a lot of debris on the roads and a risk of highway flooding. It said it would have additional staff monitoring the highways, as well as tree surgeons and gully jetters on standby to keep drains and gullies as clear as possible. Storm Ciarán follows localised weather-related incidents last weekend when large waves brought down coastal barriers in North Tyneside and homes were evacuated and shops were damaged when a village in County Durham was deluged by ""several feet of water"". In West Sussex on Sunday, a caravan park in Bognor Regis was submerged, the town's Tesco supermarket car park was flooded, and the roof of a house was ripped off in heavy winds that residents described as like a ""tornado"". Experts say a warming atmosphere increases the chance of intense rainfall and storms. However, many factors contribute to extreme weather and it takes time for scientists to calculate how much impact climate change has had on particular events - if any. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

But as a patrol of environmentalists approaches the Chilean super trawler in an inflatable boat, the cruder realities of modern industrial fishing come into view. From one of the ship’s drain holes, a steaming pink sludge cascades into the frigid waters of the Southern Ocean. It’s the foul-smelling runoff from processing the 80-meter (260-foot) factory ship’s valuable catch: Antarctic krill, a paper-clip-sized crustacean central to the region’sfoodweb and, scientists say, an important buffer to global warming. “What’s coming out of the side are the remnants of the ecosystem,” says Alistair Allan, an activist for Australia’s Bob Brown Foundation, as he looks on from the inflatable boat. “If this was off the coast of Alaska, it would be a national park. But since it’s down here at the bottom of the world, where no one is watching, you have ships almost running into whales feeding on the same things they’re fishing.” While krill fishing is banned in U.S. waters due to concerns it could impact whales, seals and other animals that feed on the shrimp-like creatures, it’s been taking place for decades inAntarctica, where krill are most abundant. It started in the 1960s, when the Soviet Union launched an industrial fleet of trawlers in search of an untapped protein source that could be canned like sardines. Surging demand for nutrient-rich krill — for feeding farm-raised fish, omega-3 pills, pet food and protein shakes — combined with advances in fishing and the still unknown impact from climate change has some scientists warning the fishery is at a critical juncture and in urgent need of stricter controls. But any further action is mired in geopolitical wrangling as Russia andChinalook to quickly expand the catch. Two Associated Press journalists spent more than two weeks at sea in March, at the tail end of the Southern Hemisphere’s summer, aboard the Dutch-flagged Allankay, operated by the conservation group Sea Shepherd Global, to take a rare, up-close look at the world’s southernmost fishery. It’s a harvest that by its very nature operates at the extremes — hundreds of miles from any port. ___ This story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation. The AP is solely responsible for all content. ___ Starting every December, around 10 to 12 mostly Norwegian and Chinese vessels brave the rough seas whipping across the tip of South America to descend upon the South Orkney Islands, a desolate chain of rocky outcrops. From there, as temperatures warm, the fleet follows the massive swarms of krill toward the South Pole, fishing at the foundation of the fragile ecosystem’s food web. Under a conservation agreement developed almost two decades ago, the krill catch has soared: from 104,728 metric tons in 2007 to 415,508 metric tons in 2022, as larger, more sophisticated vessels have joined the chase. Those levels were below internationally agreed conservation limits. A U.S.-led coalition has been calling for more restrictions and marine reserves as krill’s vital role as food for other species and in removing large amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere comes into focus. But it has met stiff opposition from China and Russia, which have made no secret of their geopolitical ambitions in the white continent. Direct competition with marine mammals seems inevitable — a reality dramatically underscored when four juvenile humpback whales were entangled by a Norwegian krill boat in 2021 and 2022. While the end of commercial whaling has allowed populations to rebound, a new study by the University of California, Santa Cruz found that pregnancy rates among humpback whales in Antarctica have been falling sharply — possibly due to a lack of krill, their main prey. Chinstrap penguins and fur seals face similar stresses. THE BOUNTY BELOW Jars of krill line the windowsills in Deborah Steinberg’s lab, their pink hue faded but their shells intact. Collected on a U.S. icebreaker, they fuel her research at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. On a recent visit, a technician unscrews one of the jars, empties the formaldehyde and rinses the krill under running water, a dozen fitting in the palm of his hand. Tiny but bountiful, Antarctic krill make up one of the planet’s largest biomasses, nourishing everything from fish to marine mammals and seabirds. “All those iconic images we associate with Antarctica of whales, seals and penguins -- it’s a megafauna hotspot, and it’s because of krill,” Steinberg said. Lesser known is krill’s important role fighting climate change. Every year, krill remove as much as 23 megatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, according to new research published by the World Wildlife Fund. That’s the equivalent of taking off the road 5 million cars every year. The carbon cleansing starts with phytoplankton that absorb greenhouse gases burned by humans, says Emma Cavan, a biologist at Imperial College London who co-authored the report. Krill feed on the microscopic plants and then transport fertilizing nutrients to the ocean floor in the form of waste and their molting shells. “Antarctic krill are worth more to nature and people left in the ocean than removed or lost through sea ice disappearance,” said Cavan, who recently submitted her estimates for peer review. Krill aren’t just a bulwark against climate change — they’re victims, too. At Steinberg’s lab, researchers are examining how warming oceans — Antarctic krill need water colder than 4 degrees Celsius (39 Fahrenheit) to survive — are altering krill’s life cycle. It’s a task made more urgent by a record loss in sea ice this year. Already, in the northernmost stretches of Antarctica where fishing activity is concentrated, populations have declined as krill migrate toward cooler waters closer to the South Pole, according to Steinberg. Other scientists say further research is required, questioning whether there’s evidence for a shift poleward and, if there is one, the cause of it. “There are surprises all the time,” Steinberg said. “And the fact that we are still learning about the effects of ocean warming on the population means we need to be very, very cautious.” REGULATING KRILL Much of the fight over krill is taking place thousands of miles away from the fishing grounds, in a former 19th century boarding school on the Australian island of Tasmania. It’s there, in the headquarters of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, that delegates from 27 member states are gathering this month to continue negotiations over a long overdue refresh of the krill management plan. The organization, established by treaty in 1982, has emerged as a model for science-based cooperation on the high seas — lawless waters that comprise nearly half the planet. But even some of the group’s boosters say it has failed to take into account the effects of climate change. “CCAMLR’s mandate is conservation — it’s right there in the name,” said Claire Christian, executive director of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, a Washington-based group that represents environmental organizations at CCAMLR proceedings. “It’s not to enable fishing.” One reason for the stalling is geopolitical wrangling. At the organization’s last annual meeting, Russia and China blocked a proposal by the U.S. that would restrict potentially dangerous unloading of krill at sea to cargo vessels. Moscow and Beijing are also pushing to expand fishing more quickly and in June teamed up to sink a proposal for a Texas-sized reserve along the Antarctic Peninsula, an area teeming with wildlife and tourists. The quarreling threatens to undermine conservation goals because all decisions must be unanimous. Currently, less than 5% of the Southern Ocean is protected — well behind CCAMLR’s target and not nearly enough to meet a United Nations goal to preserve 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. But with quotas likely to increase under any new management system some see a silver lining in the deadlock. “The irony is that if certain members aren’t agreeing to the new framework, the catch limit won’t change,” said Dirk Welsford, an Australian government researcher who chairs CCAMLR’s scientific committee. “It would require a nation to go rogue.” CRUDE TO KRILL OIL The Antarctic Provider lords over the loading dock at the port of Montevideo, Uruguay, dwarfing semi-trucks and forklifts that race around the 168-meter (550-foot) cargo ship that gathers krill from vessels at sea. A crane springs from the ship’s hold dangling a dozen white sacks, each containing half a metric ton of Antarctic krill -- now labeled “Product of Norway.” This is the first stop on krill’s journey from remote wilderness to international commodity. From this South American hub, shipments of whole dried krill spread across the globe — to feed processors and salmon farms in Europe, Canada and Australia, pet food manufacturers in China and a former ice cream factory in Houston which produces 80% of the world’s krill oil. Dominating that supply chain is Aker BioMarine, a Norwegian company responsible for about 70% of the global krill catch by volume. It’s also driving innovation, having recently introduced continuous fishing with long, cylindrical nets attached to vacuums that have the capacity to suck up 1,200 metric tons of krill per day, although the company says its most advanced ship currently averages about 500 metric tons per day - the equivalent daily diet for about 150 humpback whales. The company touts its environmental stewardship. Among other initiatives, it funds marine research, supports the creation of marine reserves and says it has reduced its carbon emissions by 50% in the last decade. It also boasts the industry’s top eco-label for sustainability. But when it comes to fishing in Antarctica, emotions run high. “Some people believe we shouldn’t fish at all, we should all be vegetarians, we shouldn’t be in Antarctica,” CEO Matts Johansen said in an interview near Oslo, Norway, arguing that krill is a sustainable source of protein for a growing global population. “There is no single solution.” Johansen said fears of an explosion in fishing are misplaced as the industry isn’t even catching all that’s allowed. He sees consolidation, not growth, in the industry because of the huge investments required. “If you look at our numbers over the last 15 years, it’s not very good advertising,” Johansen said, noting that his company has been unprofitable. Aker BioMarine’s financial wherewithal depends on another, cruder type of oil: Norway’s massive natural gas and petroleum exports. Seafood is only 3% of the asset value of Aker BioMarine’s parent, an industrial conglomerate, Aker ASA, that includes Norway’s largest privately controlled energy company. But it’s a project dear to Aker BioMarine’s billionaire founder, Kjell Inge Røkke, who got his start in fishing in Alaska in the 1990s. The bulk of Aker BioMarine’s harvest ends up in tiny pellets used in fish pens around the world. In addition to speeding up growth, krill contains astaxanthin, a pigment that gives salmon a pinker color. “The fish love it,” said Brett Glencross, technical director of IFFO, a trade organization for the marine ingredients industry. “It’s like dipping your Brussels sprouts in chocolate to get kids to eat their vegetables.” Fish farming is big business — about half of the world’s seafood is now farm raised as the oceans have been emptied of wild-caught fish. Krill, while an expensive ingredient, can help ease rising pressure on wild fish stocks also used in aquaculture, like anchovies and sardines, said Jesse Trushenski, chief scientist at Boise, Idaho-based Riverence Farms, the U.S.’ largest trout producer. “It’s important to have all the options on the table,” said Trushenski, whose company does not use krill. “When I have an entire pantry to work with, there’s more flexibility.” KRILL OIL PILLS Beyond feeding seafood, Aker BioMarine’s big push is selling krill oil capsules, which were introduced in the early 2000s, amid growing interest in omega-3 fatty acid supplements and their purported role in promoting heart, brain and joint health. It describes its mission of placing pills on the shelves of drug stores around the world with almost evangelical fervor. “We’re in business to improve human and planetary health,” boasts a recent presentation for investors. But the jury is out on how effective they are. And omega-3 supplements — krill or otherwise — haven’t been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, according to the National Institutes of Health. Johansen says studies show krill oil contains health benefits not found in traditional fish oil, including fat molecules that Aker BioMarine says make it easier to deliver omega-3 to the brain, heart and liver. It also contains choline, an essential nutrient for regulating memory and mood. “Krill is packed with important nutrients so that we can stay healthy, live long and contribute to society,” said Johansen. William Harris, a professor at the University of South Dakota who helped invent a test that measures fatty acids in red blood cells, said he’s “agnostic” about where people get their omega-3. “Krill is fine. Fish oil is fine,” he said. In addition, he said many common foods, like eggs or mushrooms, are loaded in choline in orders of magnitude more than krill pills. Krill also typically contains lower levels of omega-3s than fish, so more must be harvested to have the same fat content, according to GOED, a Salt Lake City, Utah-based group representing the omega-3 industry. INDUSTRY CHANGES Criticism of the krill fishery’s management and environmental toll has spurred some reform. In the absence of more stringent regulation, the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies, whose members are responsible for 90% of the krill taken from Antarctica, adopted in 2018 a number of self-imposed restrictions. They include the creation of no-take zones near the Antarctic Peninsula that overlap with penguin breeding colonies. The group has also agreed with calls from groups including the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy Project to come up with stricter rules on at-sea transfers of catch between vessels and the study of climate change on krill. Still, the group thinks quotas could be much higher. It points out that currently less than 1% of the estimated 60 million metric tons of krill found in the main Antarctic fishing grounds — an area larger than the U.S. — is being caught. That leaves the remaining 99% for whales and other animals. “If you look at those numbers, it’s clear we could fish more,” said Javier Arata, a Chilean trained biologist who heads the industry group. However, a leading marine biologist the industry once relied on to burnish its environmental credentials has since denounced krill fishing. Helena Herr, who studies whales at the University of Hamburg, was invited in 2021 by Arata's group to serve on an advisory panel. She accepted with the hope that she could help mitigate the effects of krill fishing on the Antarctic ecosystem. She resigned after a year, disgusted by what she viewed as the industry’s narrow focus on the buffer zones. “The more I learned about the voluntary commitment and its review process, the more I perceived the voluntary commitment as a ‘green-washing’ initiative,” she said in a resignation letter to her fellow panel members, a copy of which she provided the AP, using a term that refers to businesses making inaccurate claims that its actions are friendly to the environment. Today, she believes that krill fishing should be banned. “The buffer zones don’t decrease the overall fishing effort. They just relocate it,” she said in an interview. “People claim they know about biomass and the distribution of krill. But the data is based on such vague assumptions that we don’t really know what we’re doing.” Others have similar doubts. Whole Foods, the supermarket chain that prides itself on sustainable sourcing and is now owned by Amazon, pulled krill pills from its shelves in 2010 over concerns about the fishery’s environmental impact. And the World Wildlife Fund, which between 2007 and 2017 partnered with Aker BioMarine, lending its panda logo to promote the company’s products, has recently lodged concerns about the industry’s continued certification. Aker BioMarine in a promotional video says the amount of bycatch — unwanted fish and marine species other than krill — that it unintentionally nets on one of its ships in an entire year would fit into a “small bucket.” However, data it reported to CCAMLR put that the amount of annual bycatch — although small compared to other trawl fisheries — in the order of several metric tons per ship. When the AP pointed out this discrepancy to Johansen, he said that the claim appeared to be a mistake and the company would look into fixing its promotional material. “The key message that we’re trying to convey, and maybe it’s oversimplified in that picture of a bucket, is the bycatch in the krill fishery is extremely low,” he said. The stakes are high. In 2021, three juvenile humpback whales became entangled in a net used by Aker BioMarine’s Antarctic Sea within the span of two months. Following these incidents — the first whale deaths reported by a Norwegian krill ship — Aker BioMarine reinforced a rope barrier to repel large mammals. However, despite this modification, a fourth whale entanglement occurred on the same vessel the next season. In addition, every year, across the industry, dozens of seabirds collide with the trawlers’ metal cables, sometimes suffering deadly injuries. “The marine foragers are there for the same reason the boats are: because there’s lots of krill,” said Ari Friedlaender, a University of California, Santa Cruz biologist who has spent 25 years researching whales in Antarctica. “Some level of conflict is inevitable.” Friedlaender was among 17 authors of a recent study concluding that competition for krill and shrinking sea ice are threats to the reproductive rates of humpback whales. The peer-reviewed research, based on a measure of hormones in the blubber of female whales, found that pregnancies rise and fall sharply based on krill availability. The burning of dirty fossil fuels to fish in such remote waters also carries a heavy carbon footprint. Producing a single metric ton of krill emits an average 3,800 kilograms (8,400 pounds) of carbon dioxide, according to the Virginia-based Global Feed LCA Institute, an industry-led initiative that tracks the environmental costs of hundreds of feed ingredients. That’s more than six times the pollution associated with fishing for Peruvian anchovy, a popular ingredient for fish feed. Johansen downplayed such comparisons, saying Aker BioMarine’s own carbon footprint is much lower than the industry average and falling fast thanks to innovations in its engines. By 2050 it aims to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels altogether and power its fleet with hydrogen-based fuels currently in development. “We are going to be one of those first companies that use that,” he pledged. SUSTAINABILITY With an approaching storm threatening hurricane-force winds, the Allankay abandons the krill fleet and finds shelter in a quiet cove protected by the craggy rim of a still active underwater volcano. A stone’s throw from a few lounging sea lions, rusting storage tanks, boilers and beached harpoon boats lay testament to Deception Island’s past as a Norwegian whaling station. Here, between 1911 and 1931, were culled some of the 3 million whales killed last century as part of a mass slaughter that nearly drove them to extinction. A century later, its blanket of blubber no longer lighting up the world, whaling has all but ended and many once endangered species are thriving. Capt. Peter Hammarstedt, the campaign director for Sea Shepherd Global, sees an infinitely more complex threat hanging over the still recovering ecosystem – one as unassuming as krill-fed farmed salmon or health supplements on supermarket shelves. “Most people know sustainability when they see it,” says Hammarstedt, “and it does not look like a fleet of ships traveling thousands of miles, to the bottom of the world, to take out the very building block of life in the Antarctic ecosystem for products we simply do not need.” -- Keyton reported from off Antarctica and in Montevideo, Uruguay, and Ski, Norway; JoNel Aleccia in Los Angeles and Helen Wieffering and Fu Ting in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report. __ Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/"

But any further action is mired in geopolitical wrangling as Russia andChinalook to quickly expand the catch. Two Associated Press journalists spent more than two weeks at sea in March, at the tail end of the Southern Hemisphere’s summer, aboard the Dutch-flagged Allankay, operated by the conservation group Sea Shepherd Global, to take a rare, up-close look at the world’s southernmost fishery. It’s a harvest that by its very nature operates at the extremes — hundreds of miles from any port. ___ This story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation. The AP is solely responsible for all content. ___ Starting every December, around 10 to 12 mostly Norwegian and Chinese vessels brave the rough seas whipping across the tip of South America to descend upon the South Orkney Islands, a desolate chain of rocky outcrops. From there, as temperatures warm, the fleet follows the massive swarms of krill toward the South Pole, fishing at the foundation of the fragile ecosystem’s food web. Under a conservation agreement developed almost two decades ago, the krill catch has soared: from 104,728 metric tons in 2007 to 415,508 metric tons in 2022, as larger, more sophisticated vessels have joined the chase. Those levels were below internationally agreed conservation limits. A U.S.-led coalition has been calling for more restrictions and marine reserves as krill’s vital role as food for other species and in removing large amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere comes into focus. But it has met stiff opposition from China and Russia, which have made no secret of their geopolitical ambitions in the white continent. Direct competition with marine mammals seems inevitable — a reality dramatically underscored when four juvenile humpback whales were entangled by a Norwegian krill boat in 2021 and 2022. While the end of commercial whaling has allowed populations to rebound, a new study by the University of California, Santa Cruz found that pregnancy rates among humpback whales in Antarctica have been falling sharply — possibly due to a lack of krill, their main prey. Chinstrap penguins and fur seals face similar stresses. THE BOUNTY BELOW Jars of krill line the windowsills in Deborah Steinberg’s lab, their pink hue faded but their shells intact. Collected on a U.S. icebreaker, they fuel her research at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. On a recent visit, a technician unscrews one of the jars, empties the formaldehyde and rinses the krill under running water, a dozen fitting in the palm of his hand. Tiny but bountiful, Antarctic krill make up one of the planet’s largest biomasses, nourishing everything from fish to marine mammals and seabirds. “All those iconic images we associate with Antarctica of whales, seals and penguins -- it’s a megafauna hotspot, and it’s because of krill,” Steinberg said. Lesser known is krill’s important role fighting climate change. Every year, krill remove as much as 23 megatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, according to new research published by the World Wildlife Fund. That’s the equivalent of taking off the road 5 million cars every year. The carbon cleansing starts with phytoplankton that absorb greenhouse gases burned by humans, says Emma Cavan, a biologist at Imperial College London who co-authored the report. Krill feed on the microscopic plants and then transport fertilizing nutrients to the ocean floor in the form of waste and their molting shells. “Antarctic krill are worth more to nature and people left in the ocean than removed or lost through sea ice disappearance,” said Cavan, who recently submitted her estimates for peer review. Krill aren’t just a bulwark against climate change — they’re victims, too. At Steinberg’s lab, researchers are examining how warming oceans — Antarctic krill need water colder than 4 degrees Celsius (39 Fahrenheit) to survive — are altering krill’s life cycle. It’s a task made more urgent by a record loss in sea ice this year. Already, in the northernmost stretches of Antarctica where fishing activity is concentrated, populations have declined as krill migrate toward cooler waters closer to the South Pole, according to Steinberg. Other scientists say further research is required, questioning whether there’s evidence for a shift poleward and, if there is one, the cause of it. “There are surprises all the time,” Steinberg said. “And the fact that we are still learning about the effects of ocean warming on the population means we need to be very, very cautious.” REGULATING KRILL Much of the fight over krill is taking place thousands of miles away from the fishing grounds, in a former 19th century boarding school on the Australian island of Tasmania. It’s there, in the headquarters of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, that delegates from 27 member states are gathering this month to continue negotiations over a long overdue refresh of the krill management plan. The organization, established by treaty in 1982, has emerged as a model for science-based cooperation on the high seas — lawless waters that comprise nearly half the planet. But even some of the group’s boosters say it has failed to take into account the effects of climate change. “CCAMLR’s mandate is conservation — it’s right there in the name,” said Claire Christian, executive director of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, a Washington-based group that represents environmental organizations at CCAMLR proceedings. “It’s not to enable fishing.” One reason for the stalling is geopolitical wrangling. At the organization’s last annual meeting, Russia and China blocked a proposal by the U.S. that would restrict potentially dangerous unloading of krill at sea to cargo vessels. Moscow and Beijing are also pushing to expand fishing more quickly and in June teamed up to sink a proposal for a Texas-sized reserve along the Antarctic Peninsula, an area teeming with wildlife and tourists. The quarreling threatens to undermine conservation goals because all decisions must be unanimous. Currently, less than 5% of the Southern Ocean is protected — well behind CCAMLR’s target and not nearly enough to meet a United Nations goal to preserve 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. But with quotas likely to increase under any new management system some see a silver lining in the deadlock. “The irony is that if certain members aren’t agreeing to the new framework, the catch limit won’t change,” said Dirk Welsford, an Australian government researcher who chairs CCAMLR’s scientific committee. “It would require a nation to go rogue.” CRUDE TO KRILL OIL The Antarctic Provider lords over the loading dock at the port of Montevideo, Uruguay, dwarfing semi-trucks and forklifts that race around the 168-meter (550-foot) cargo ship that gathers krill from vessels at sea. A crane springs from the ship’s hold dangling a dozen white sacks, each containing half a metric ton of Antarctic krill -- now labeled “Product of Norway.” This is the first stop on krill’s journey from remote wilderness to international commodity. From this South American hub, shipments of whole dried krill spread across the globe — to feed processors and salmon farms in Europe, Canada and Australia, pet food manufacturers in China and a former ice cream factory in Houston which produces 80% of the world’s krill oil. Dominating that supply chain is Aker BioMarine, a Norwegian company responsible for about 70% of the global krill catch by volume. It’s also driving innovation, having recently introduced continuous fishing with long, cylindrical nets attached to vacuums that have the capacity to suck up 1,200 metric tons of krill per day, although the company says its most advanced ship currently averages about 500 metric tons per day - the equivalent daily diet for about 150 humpback whales. The company touts its environmental stewardship. Among other initiatives, it funds marine research, supports the creation of marine reserves and says it has reduced its carbon emissions by 50% in the last decade. It also boasts the industry’s top eco-label for sustainability. But when it comes to fishing in Antarctica, emotions run high. “Some people believe we shouldn’t fish at all, we should all be vegetarians, we shouldn’t be in Antarctica,” CEO Matts Johansen said in an interview near Oslo, Norway, arguing that krill is a sustainable source of protein for a growing global population. “There is no single solution.” Johansen said fears of an explosion in fishing are misplaced as the industry isn’t even catching all that’s allowed. He sees consolidation, not growth, in the industry because of the huge investments required. “If you look at our numbers over the last 15 years, it’s not very good advertising,” Johansen said, noting that his company has been unprofitable. Aker BioMarine’s financial wherewithal depends on another, cruder type of oil: Norway’s massive natural gas and petroleum exports. Seafood is only 3% of the asset value of Aker BioMarine’s parent, an industrial conglomerate, Aker ASA, that includes Norway’s largest privately controlled energy company. But it’s a project dear to Aker BioMarine’s billionaire founder, Kjell Inge Røkke, who got his start in fishing in Alaska in the 1990s. The bulk of Aker BioMarine’s harvest ends up in tiny pellets used in fish pens around the world. In addition to speeding up growth, krill contains astaxanthin, a pigment that gives salmon a pinker color. “The fish love it,” said Brett Glencross, technical director of IFFO, a trade organization for the marine ingredients industry. “It’s like dipping your Brussels sprouts in chocolate to get kids to eat their vegetables.” Fish farming is big business — about half of the world’s seafood is now farm raised as the oceans have been emptied of wild-caught fish. Krill, while an expensive ingredient, can help ease rising pressure on wild fish stocks also used in aquaculture, like anchovies and sardines, said Jesse Trushenski, chief scientist at Boise, Idaho-based Riverence Farms, the U.S.’ largest trout producer. “It’s important to have all the options on the table,” said Trushenski, whose company does not use krill. “When I have an entire pantry to work with, there’s more flexibility.” KRILL OIL PILLS Beyond feeding seafood, Aker BioMarine’s big push is selling krill oil capsules, which were introduced in the early 2000s, amid growing interest in omega-3 fatty acid supplements and their purported role in promoting heart, brain and joint health. It describes its mission of placing pills on the shelves of drug stores around the world with almost evangelical fervor. “We’re in business to improve human and planetary health,” boasts a recent presentation for investors. But the jury is out on how effective they are. And omega-3 supplements — krill or otherwise — haven’t been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, according to the National Institutes of Health. Johansen says studies show krill oil contains health benefits not found in traditional fish oil, including fat molecules that Aker BioMarine says make it easier to deliver omega-3 to the brain, heart and liver. It also contains choline, an essential nutrient for regulating memory and mood. “Krill is packed with important nutrients so that we can stay healthy, live long and contribute to society,” said Johansen. William Harris, a professor at the University of South Dakota who helped invent a test that measures fatty acids in red blood cells, said he’s “agnostic” about where people get their omega-3. “Krill is fine. Fish oil is fine,” he said. In addition, he said many common foods, like eggs or mushrooms, are loaded in choline in orders of magnitude more than krill pills. Krill also typically contains lower levels of omega-3s than fish, so more must be harvested to have the same fat content, according to GOED, a Salt Lake City, Utah-based group representing the omega-3 industry. INDUSTRY CHANGES Criticism of the krill fishery’s management and environmental toll has spurred some reform. In the absence of more stringent regulation, the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies, whose members are responsible for 90% of the krill taken from Antarctica, adopted in 2018 a number of self-imposed restrictions. They include the creation of no-take zones near the Antarctic Peninsula that overlap with penguin breeding colonies. The group has also agreed with calls from groups including the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy Project to come up with stricter rules on at-sea transfers of catch between vessels and the study of climate change on krill. Still, the group thinks quotas could be much higher. It points out that currently less than 1% of the estimated 60 million metric tons of krill found in the main Antarctic fishing grounds — an area larger than the U.S. — is being caught. That leaves the remaining 99% for whales and other animals. “If you look at those numbers, it’s clear we could fish more,” said Javier Arata, a Chilean trained biologist who heads the industry group. However, a leading marine biologist the industry once relied on to burnish its environmental credentials has since denounced krill fishing. Helena Herr, who studies whales at the University of Hamburg, was invited in 2021 by Arata's group to serve on an advisory panel. She accepted with the hope that she could help mitigate the effects of krill fishing on the Antarctic ecosystem. She resigned after a year, disgusted by what she viewed as the industry’s narrow focus on the buffer zones. “The more I learned about the voluntary commitment and its review process, the more I perceived the voluntary commitment as a ‘green-washing’ initiative,” she said in a resignation letter to her fellow panel members, a copy of which she provided the AP, using a term that refers to businesses making inaccurate claims that its actions are friendly to the environment. Today, she believes that krill fishing should be banned. “The buffer zones don’t decrease the overall fishing effort. They just relocate it,” she said in an interview. “People claim they know about biomass and the distribution of krill. But the data is based on such vague assumptions that we don’t really know what we’re doing.” Others have similar doubts. Whole Foods, the supermarket chain that prides itself on sustainable sourcing and is now owned by Amazon, pulled krill pills from its shelves in 2010 over concerns about the fishery’s environmental impact. And the World Wildlife Fund, which between 2007 and 2017 partnered with Aker BioMarine, lending its panda logo to promote the company’s products, has recently lodged concerns about the industry’s continued certification. Aker BioMarine in a promotional video says the amount of bycatch — unwanted fish and marine species other than krill — that it unintentionally nets on one of its ships in an entire year would fit into a “small bucket.” However, data it reported to CCAMLR put that the amount of annual bycatch — although small compared to other trawl fisheries — in the order of several metric tons per ship. When the AP pointed out this discrepancy to Johansen, he said that the claim appeared to be a mistake and the company would look into fixing its promotional material. “The key message that we’re trying to convey, and maybe it’s oversimplified in that picture of a bucket, is the bycatch in the krill fishery is extremely low,” he said. The stakes are high. In 2021, three juvenile humpback whales became entangled in a net used by Aker BioMarine’s Antarctic Sea within the span of two months. Following these incidents — the first whale deaths reported by a Norwegian krill ship — Aker BioMarine reinforced a rope barrier to repel large mammals. However, despite this modification, a fourth whale entanglement occurred on the same vessel the next season. In addition, every year, across the industry, dozens of seabirds collide with the trawlers’ metal cables, sometimes suffering deadly injuries. “The marine foragers are there for the same reason the boats are: because there’s lots of krill,” said Ari Friedlaender, a University of California, Santa Cruz biologist who has spent 25 years researching whales in Antarctica. “Some level of conflict is inevitable.” Friedlaender was among 17 authors of a recent study concluding that competition for krill and shrinking sea ice are threats to the reproductive rates of humpback whales. The peer-reviewed research, based on a measure of hormones in the blubber of female whales, found that pregnancies rise and fall sharply based on krill availability. The burning of dirty fossil fuels to fish in such remote waters also carries a heavy carbon footprint. Producing a single metric ton of krill emits an average 3,800 kilograms (8,400 pounds) of carbon dioxide, according to the Virginia-based Global Feed LCA Institute, an industry-led initiative that tracks the environmental costs of hundreds of feed ingredients. That’s more than six times the pollution associated with fishing for Peruvian anchovy, a popular ingredient for fish feed. Johansen downplayed such comparisons, saying Aker BioMarine’s own carbon footprint is much lower than the industry average and falling fast thanks to innovations in its engines. By 2050 it aims to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels altogether and power its fleet with hydrogen-based fuels currently in development. “We are going to be one of those first companies that use that,” he pledged. SUSTAINABILITY With an approaching storm threatening hurricane-force winds, the Allankay abandons the krill fleet and finds shelter in a quiet cove protected by the craggy rim of a still active underwater volcano. A stone’s throw from a few lounging sea lions, rusting storage tanks, boilers and beached harpoon boats lay testament to Deception Island’s past as a Norwegian whaling station. Here, between 1911 and 1931, were culled some of the 3 million whales killed last century as part of a mass slaughter that nearly drove them to extinction. A century later, its blanket of blubber no longer lighting up the world, whaling has all but ended and many once endangered species are thriving. Capt. Peter Hammarstedt, the campaign director for Sea Shepherd Global, sees an infinitely more complex threat hanging over the still recovering ecosystem – one as unassuming as krill-fed farmed salmon or health supplements on supermarket shelves. “Most people know sustainability when they see it,” says Hammarstedt, “and it does not look like a fleet of ships traveling thousands of miles, to the bottom of the world, to take out the very building block of life in the Antarctic ecosystem for products we simply do not need.” -- Keyton reported from off Antarctica and in Montevideo, Uruguay, and Ski, Norway; JoNel Aleccia in Los Angeles and Helen Wieffering and Fu Ting in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report. __ Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/"

""Because of this, we don't really have a good idea of how they have changed over time, or how they are projected to change into the future.""To paint a clearer picture of how the frequency of hail events has changed, the researchers studied historical estimates of atmospheric conditions, with hail-prone conditions acting as a ""proxy"" for hail occurrence over the past four decades.""We wanted to produce a continental map of how hail hazard frequency has changed across Australia, and to be able to look into whatatmospheric changesare driving these patterns,"" says Dr. Raupach.The latest study, published recently in the journalnpj Climate and Atmospheric Science, provides the first continental-scale analysis of hail hazard frequency trends for Australia.The team of researchers, which included scientists from the Bureau of Meteorology, hope that this research will help our understanding of hail events, which is important to theinsurance industry, as well as agricultural and city planning sectors.How do hailstorms form?Not just any thunderstorm can produce hail. Hailstorms require certain atmospheric ""ingredients"" to form. One of the important ingredients is that the atmosphere needs to be unstable.""This means that there is a propensity for updrafts to form—updrafts occur when there's warm air near the ground and cooler air further up. And if a little bit of that warm air gets into the cool air, then it rises like a balloon and it draws air up into an updraft,"" says Dr. Raupach.There also needs to be enough moisture in the updraft for there to be supercooled liquid water and ice all swirling around high in the storm.""Another factor is that hail melts as it falls. And so even if you have hail forming up high, it has to be large enough to survive melting to actually reach the ground as a block of ice.""And finally, hail formation is enhanced bywind shear—the changing properties of the wind by height. ""This is the wind changing direction or velocity as you get higher in the atmosphere,"" says Dr. Raupach. ""If there's a lot of shear, then the storm tends to be more severe and more prone to forming hail.""When all of these factors are present, the atmospheric conditions become ""hail-prone.""Producing a 'hail proxy'The researchers combined the known ingredients required for a hailstorm to develop a ""hail proxy,"" which they applied to 40 years of reanalysis data. Reanalysis products combine observations with numerical weather modeling techniques to obtain an estimate of the state of the atmosphere in the past.The team then used the hail proxy to turn the reanalysis record of atmospheric conditions into an indication of whether each day was hail-prone or not. ""This means that instead of looking for occurrences of hail at the surface, because our records there are so spotty, we used an estimate of the atmospheric conditions on a grid of points across Australia for the past four decades,"" Dr. Raupach says.Using this statistical analysis on historic estimates, the researchers were able to produce a map of how the number of hail-prone days per year have changed across the whole continent, at a resolution of about 30 kilometers per pixel.""The Bureau's long-term weather radar archive was used to compareradar observationswith the reanalysis hail proxy,"" says the Bureau of Meteorology radar research scientist Dr. Joshua Soderholm.Radars work by sending out pulses of electromagnetic radiation and looking for ""echoes"" of the pulses reflected off particles in the atmosphere. They can indicate there may be hail present when there are particularly strong echoes in the atmosphere.""Data from 20 Bureau radar sites across the country was used in the comparison, with between 12 and 24 years of records at each site,"" says Dr. Soderholm.""The radars cover a shorter time period and have limited spatial coverage, but they can pick up indicators of hail. Our radar results helped to corroborate the pattern of results we saw,"" says Dr. Raupach.Changes in hail-prone days""We found that the number of days considered hail-prone have decreased over much of the country, but increased over the southwest and southeast where there are large population centers,"" says Dr. Raupach.In particular, the annual number of hail-prone days increased by up to approximately 40% around Sydney and Perth. This relates to about a 10% increase per decade in the number of days that could cause a hailstorm.""We found a decrease in hail-prone days across most of the country, particularly across Queensland, but also across the center and the north of the country. But we did see some increases in the southeast and the southwest. And that happens to coincide with large populations and exposed assets, including in Sydney, Canberra, and Perth.""As Dr. Raupach explains, a hail-prone day is far from guaranteed to produce hail. ""Really what we're interested in is the changes in the data. It's all relative. So even though not every hail-prone day produces hail, we can say that if there are more hail-prone days, there is an increased chance of hail.""Building resilient citiesWhile we don't know exactly what is driving these significant changes in hail patterns, the research team have carefully considered the role climate change may be playing.""This is not a climate attribution study, but we kept in mind a broad view of how we might expect hailstorms to behave in a warmer atmosphere,"" says Dr. ""The changes vary a surprising amount by region, and those differences highlight where we need more understanding.""The general expectation is that under climate change, surface hail may become less frequent due to increased melting, because the atmosphere is warmer and more hail melts away before it hits the ground. On the other hand, a warmer atmosphere would be expected to be more unstable, leading to generation of larger hailstones. Since large hail is more likely to survive increased melting, when hail does occur it may be larger and therefore more severe.The research team discovered that the observed patterns in hail-prone day changes are primarily driven by changes in extreme atmospheric instability. ""And those changes are incredibly complex,"" says Dr. ""They also depend a lot on the region. Where you have increased instability, then you might get more generation of hail and larger hailstones being generated in those regions that might survive more melting. But where you have decreases in instability, then you have kind of a dampening effect.""The links with climate change are multifaceted and more work needs to be done to understand how these hailstorm patterns will continue to change under warming conditions.Importantly, these findings feed into our understanding of changes to the risk from hail. ""This is essential information for theagricultural industry, because hailstorms can raze crops, the insurance industry, because of the damage hail can cause, and for city planning,"" says Dr. Raupach.In fact, hail damage is a leading cause of insured losses in Australia. ""Hail is really one of the driving factors in the year-to-year costs for the insurance industry. The industry is interested in understanding how this hazard might change in the future.""Dr. Raupach and his team hope this information on trends can be incorporated into planning for how we build resilient infrastructure. ""We need to think about resilient agriculture that can deal with potential increases in the hail hazards, if they were to continue into the future,"" says Dr. ""And likewise, how we can protect our densely populated areas from damage due to hailstorms.""This research has shown us how particular weather patterns have changed between 1979 to 2021, but Dr. Raupach is keen to extend his research to help predict future trends in hailstorms. ""I am interested in moving from what we've observed in the past, to projections for the future. And that means using simulations and climate models to get the same kind of information for the future for Australia and globally."""

MEXICO CITY Hurricane Otis strengthened from tropical storm to a … [+1118 chars]",Bermuda,"People are helped as they cross a highway blocked by a landslide triggered by Hurricane Otis near Acapulco, Mexico, on Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2023.Marco Ugarte/APhide caption People are helped as they cross a highway blocked by a landslide triggered by Hurricane Otis near Acapulco, Mexico, on Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2023. ACAPULCO, Mexico — Hurricane Otis slammed Mexico's southern Pacific coast as a powerful and dangerous Category 5 hurricane Wednesday, unleashing massive flooding in the resort city of Acapulco, sending sheets of earth down steep mountainsides, and leaving large swaths of the state of Guerrero without power or cellphone service. While little is known about possible deaths or the full extent of the damage — the main highway into Acapulco was impassable — experts are calling Otis the strongest storm in history to make landfall along the Eastern Pacific Coast. Acapulco's Diamond Zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, appeared to be mostly underwater in television footage shared online Wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water. Large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. Dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. People wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other less-flooded streets soldiers shoveled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement. By late Wednesday afternoon, Otis had weakened to below tropical depression strength and was dissipating over the mountains, yet many on the coast were left reeling. Just outside Acapulco, Flor Campos trudged for more than an hour through mud along a highway Wednesday morning before she peeled off her shoes, worried she'd lose them in the muck. The domestic worker from a small town in Guerrero was among dozens of families, women and children who clambered over tree trunks and other debris left by landslides in the mountainous terrain. It was a daunting escape, but people were desperate to get out. ""We had been waiting since 3 in the morning to get out, so we decided to walk. It was more dangerous to stay. There are trees knocked down, power lines down,"" Campos said. ""There are children back there, 2 or 3 years old, with no water, nothing."" On Tuesday, Otis took many by surprise when it rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 as it tore along the coast. Researchers tracking the storm told The Associated Press that the storm broke records for how quickly it intensified, at a time whenclimate change has exacerbateddevastating weather events like this one. ""It's one thing to have a Category 5 hurricane make landfall somewhere when you're expecting it or expecting a strong hurricane, but to have it happen when you're not expecting anything to happen is truly a nightmare,"" said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. Acapulco, Tecpan and other towns along the Costa Grande in Guerrero were hit hard, said Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. He said conditions were so bad that communication with the area had been ""completely lost."" Acapulco is a city of nearly 1 million people at the foot of steep mountains. Luxury homes and slums alike cover the city's hillsides with views of the glistening Pacific. Once drawing Hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, Acapulco has in more recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving many international tourists to the Caribbean waters of Cancun and the Riviera Maya or beaches farther down the Pacific coast in the state of Oaxaca. Between the internationally known resorts of Acapulco and Zihuatanejo are two dozen small towns and villages. On the outskirts of Acapulco on Wednesday, highway workers looked on helplessly without the heavy machinery needed to clear debris from the roadway. They warned the road could give way at any time because of the rain-softened ground beneath. Bridges in some areas had collapsed, and trees leaned almost horizontally across the highway, not because they were uprooted, but because the earth they grew on had slid down the slope. Damage to the local military airport made it hard for authorities to access the region, López Obrador said. He said high-ranking members of his government would travel to Guerrero to help. Mexico's Secretary of National Defense told The Associated Press on Wednesday that 7,000 military personnel had been deployed to the area, and that more than 1,200 more were on their way. A long convoy of trucks from the national electric company moved through the Guerrero state capital, Chilpancingo, toward Acapulco before dawn Wednesday. Officials in Guerrero said on Wednesday afternoon that they were working to restore phone service. Otis is stronger than Hurricane Pauline, which hit Acapulco in 1997, López Obrador said. Pauline destroyed swaths of the city and killed more than 200 people. Hundreds of others were injured in flooding and mudslides. Otis' arrival camejust days after Hurricane Normastruck the southern tip of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula to the north. While many were caught by surprise, Acapulco still was able to open two dozen shelters in the hours before Otis made landfall. Videos from hotel guests in Acapulco posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, as the storm came ashore showed blinding horizontal rain and howling winds. In one, white towels danced high above a hotel's cavernous courtyard like sheets of paper and bed mattresses trembled on balconies, apparently put there to blunt the storm's winds. Another showed wind and rain howling unimpeded down hotel hallways. In still another, a family huddled inside a hotel room shower to escape breaking windows and fierce wind. In the Atlantic, Hurricane Tammy moved northeast over open water with winds of 105 mph after sweeping through the Lesser Antilles over the weekend. Tammy was about 515 miles southeast of Bermuda, and was moving northeast at about 13 mph. The storm was expected to become a powerful extratropical cyclone by Thursday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center."

Philippe had 50 mph winds and was making its closest approach to Bermuda Friday afternoon. It is expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain to the island throughout the day. The system has transitioned into a more sprawling, wet and windy mess known as a post-tropical storm, and is on track to hit Maine Saturday night. A soggy, miserable weekend is likely across much of the Northeast, with the greatest chances for heavy rain likely in northern New England. Rain instigated by the cold front is already starting to work its way into far western parts of the Northeast Friday and will keep moving east through the weekend. ALevel 2 of 4slight risk of excessive rainfall was issued for Saturday by NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center in areas where repeated bouts of rain could trigger localized flash flooding. Much of the Northeast is coming off of one ofits wettest summers on record, NOAA data shows. The wet trend has only continued into fall, raising the risk for flash flooding. Parts of the Northeastwere inundated byrecord-breaking rainfalllast week. The most intense rainfall hit the New York City tri-state, where floodwaters inundated subways, roads and basements and several locations recorded the wettest day in history. Heavy rainfall is not expected to be as severe as last week, but a widespread 1 to 3 inches of rain is possible north of New York City in New York and into New England. Higher amounts closer up to 5 inches could fall where the heaviest rain sets up, most likely in Maine.

The Atlantic… [+3842 chars]",Bermuda,"Experts fear analready active hurricane seasoncould come to an eventful and exceptional end as unusually warm, storm-boosting ocean temperatures and a slow-to-emergeEl Niñocombine. The Atlantic season and its 18 named storms has already beenabove average,according to Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher with Colorado State University. But October usually signals changes in activity and the areas where storms form. The first half of October is typically the final stretch of the busiest time of the Atlantic hurricane season. The number of storms usuallybegins to drop off quickly toward the end of October and craters by the time the season ends on November 30. Storms that do form typically do so in areas that are much too close for comfort – in the Gulf of Mexico, near the Bahamas and the western Caribbean – rather than in the open Atlantic, where storms likeCategory 5 Hurricane Leeformed earlier this year. This means places like Florida, which wasdevastated by Category 5 Hurricane Michael’s landfallin October 2018, need to be on particular guard in a normal October. However, extremely high sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic “expand the reach of where something might form” into the late season this year, Brian McNoldy, a Senior Research Associate at the University of Miami, told CNN. This could mean more storms develop late into the season in the main development region, a large section of the open Atlantic Ocean that stretches from Africa to the eastern Caribbean. If this were to happen, parts of the eastern Caribbean, Bermuda and the East Coast could still be at risk for tropical strikes. The battle between warm ocean waterand the effect of El Niño has posed a forecasting challenge throughout this hurricane season, as one factor is seemingly negating the other. El Niño typically causes strong upper-level winds in the Atlantic, which suppress hurricane activity. But weaker upper-level winds – which are more favorable for hurricanes to develop – tend to be associated with warmer ocean temperatures, which is exactly what we have seen this year, Fischer explained. On balance, the warmer ocean temperatures and weaker winds are winning, and more storms have been able to form than would otherwise be possible in a typical El Niño year,Klotzbach previously told CNN. This clash is expected to continue into October and November. “Usually as we get into the back half of the hurricane season, El Niño tends to dominate, even if the Atlantic is warm. But we’ve just never seen anything this warm,” Michael Fischer, an Associate Scientist with the University of Miami, told CNN. This could leave the Atlantic open to more tropical activity in general through the rest of the season, according to Fischer, but it remains to be seen. “So we’re kind of in uncharted waters, if you will, and it’s tough to make any kind of confident forecast because of that,” Fischer told CNN. One thing is for certain, though: Any tropical system that does form would likely get an “extra boost” in strength from the exceptionally warm water, according to McNoldy. This has already been demonstrated by multiple storms this season, includingHurricane IdaliaandHurricane Lee– both of whichrapidly intensifiedwhile moving over extremely warm water. An El Niño winter is coming. Here's what that could mean for the US It’s possible that upper-level winds will remain at abnormally low levels across the main development region and the Caribbean, where the effect of El Niño is typically most pronounced, according to Fischer. This, combined with high ocean temperatures, may leave nothing standing in the way of tropical development. “Is El Niño at some point going to say, ‘Forget this, I’m in charge?’” Klotzbach said. “I don’t see massive signs of that.” If conditions continue to be ripe for tropical development through the end of hurricane season, it’ll add onto what has already been an abnormal season. “There are a lot of things going on this year that are unusual” in the Atlantic, Klotzbach added. “We have an Atlantic that’s in a different kind of league from other years.”"

The storm was expected to arrive late Saturday with gusts up to 50 mph (80 kph) in eastern and northern Maine, strong enough to cause power outages, along with 1 to 4 inches (2.5 to 10 centimeters) of rain over a broader area in a state where the ground is already saturated from previous rain, said Anne Strauser, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Maine. Down East Maine and Atlantic Canada were expected to bear the storm's brunt just three weeks after being hit by Tropical Storm Lee. Philippe, now a low pressure system, no longer a tropical storm, should be milder but will still pack a punch. The National Weather Service in Gray, Maine, said a high surf advisory was in effect for Sunday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. with waves from 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) on the Maine coast including York, Cumberland, Sagadahoc, Lincoln, Knox and Waldo counties and on the New Hampshire coast in Rockingham County. The dreary forecast meant another washout for many in New England, which already dealt with heavy rain, powerful thunderstorms, flash flooding and even tornadoes in the past month. Maine’s largest city, Portland, experienced the second-wettest summer in terms of rainy days. June and July were especially brutal with rainfall during six out of eight weekends during that stretch. Boaters, beachgoers, hikers, campers and others who enjoy the outdoors have lamented the wet weather. “The weather is a big topic of conversation, mostly about how poor it’s been,” said Vanessa Donnelly, general manager of Four Points Marina, which has 150 boat slips in Portland Harbor. Rainy weather has slowed boating activity, she said. Philippe made landfall in Barbuda late Monday while drenching the northeast Caribbean, downing trees and power lines in a handful of islands. The storm lost some steam after hitting Bermuda on Friday and heading northward into colder waters. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Lidia swirled through open waters in the Pacific on Friday night. A National Hurricane Center update at 11 p.m. EST said the storm was located about 515 miles (825 kilometers) west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, and about 460 miles (745 kilometers) south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California with maximum sustained winds of up to 70 mph (110 kph). Lidia was moving west at 6 mph (9 kph) but expected to turn northwest and north over the weekend. Surf swells will begin affecting the west coast of Mexico and the Baja peninsula in California on Saturday, the center said."

ITZY member Yeji is known for her versatile features since she canrockany hair-and-makeup style. When her hair is slicked back into a high ponytail, fans can immediately spot her foxlike features. But when wearing space buns, she turns into a cute and charismatic girl. 12. Lee Sae-rom has earned herself thenicknames""Visual Saerom"" and ""Suwon Visual"" over her career as a K-Pop idol as fans started to recognize her beauty. Other than being a talented singer and dancer, she is a model with great fashion sense. 11. MAMAMOO debuted as a ""non-visual"" group, which made the K-Pop community focus more on their talent and skills. But most fansseemedto think that if the visual position were to be given to a member, it could have gone to Solar since her features best fit the beauty standards in South Korea. 10. STAYC member's innocent and angelic-like features make her stand out among the members of the group. Interestingly, she is in charge of ""aegyo"" — when an idol acts cute and speaks in a baby-talk manner. 9. Former Apink member Son Na-eun may have chosen a different career path, but she was once known as the visual and vocalist of the group. So, it's no wonder why her beauty was also suited for roles in acting. She recently starred in JTBC's ""Agency"" and tvN's ""Ghost Doctor."" 8. Girl's Day member Lee Hye-ri — known by the mononym Hyeri — is widely known for her goofy and wacky personality. However, she also knows when she needs to slay and pose during events and in front of the camera. Her beauty is known for giving off a more mature and stronger vibe. 7. TWICE member Momo may have soft-like features, but her beauty shines the most when she flawlessly dances on stage. She is currently the main dancer, sub-vocalist and sub-rapper for the group. 6. Chaeryeong's beauty hasn't gone unnoticed since she actually made it to the upper ranks of TC Candler's most beautiful faces list in 2022. The ITZY member ranked No. 22 out of 100, though she's more known as a main dancer with a captivating stage presence. 5. Shen Xioating was one of the trainees who successfully earned a coveted spot in Kep1er via Mnet's survival show, ""Girls Planet 999."" During the show, the Chinese member consecutively ranked first place and was able to attract a huge fanbase, thanks to her powerful stage presence and center-like aura. 4. Known as one of the original visual queens in K-Pop, Irene already captivated a huge fanbase since her debut in 2014. According toKoreaboo, most of her fans think her side profile stands out the most as it highlights her high nose bridge, which fits the standards of Korean beauty. 3. IVE's Jang Won-young could be considered the newest ""it girl"" of this generation of K-Pop as her stunning visuals have already landed hercountless brand dealswith popular and high-end brands, including Miu Miu, Chaumet, Innisfree, KIRSH, SK Telecom, BVLGARI, HapaKristin, Gospheres and Samsung. 2. Kim Ah-young — who goes by the stage name Yura — has transitioned into becoming an actress in the Korean entertainment industry since Girl's Day went on a hiatus in 2019. She was also known as a visual queen who couldslayany fashion style, most notably dresses. 1. Of course, BLACKPINK member Jisoo has also made it to this list as she has garnered the attention of fans from across the globe, who are praising her for her goddess-like beauty and flawless skin.

One person was killed by a falling tree, another drowned in a swollen river and two others were injured after the hurricane made landfall. The hurricane knocked over trees and blew roofs off houses with winds as high as 140 mph (220 kph) before moving inland. Laura Velázquez, the head ofMexico’s civil defense system, said Wednesday that one person died on the northern outskirts of Puerto Vallarta after being hit by a falling tree, and two others were injured elsewhere in the area. The governor of Jalisco state, Enrique Alfaro, said another man drowned in a town south of where the hurricane hit when he tried to cross a swollen river late Tuesday night. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Wednesday that Lidia’s winds were down to 35 mph (57 kph) as it dissipated about 145 miles (235 kilometers) north-northeast of the city of Guadalajara, Mexico’s second-largest city and the capital of the western state of Jalisco. Lidia made landfall Tuesday on Cabo Corrientes, a sparsely populated peninsula, and then moved inland south of Puerto Vallarta with winds of 105 mph (165 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center. The hurricane remained powerful even after moving over land, with some highways briefly blocked in the region. Jalisco state had 23 shelters open, and the Puerto Vallarta city government said a few dozen people had gone to shelters there. Lidia's impact came one day after Tropical Storm Max hit the southern Pacific coast, hundreds of miles away, and then dissipated. Rains from Max washed out part of a coastal highway in the southern state of Guerrero. In 2015, Hurricane Patricia, a Category 5 hurricane, also made landfall on the same sparsely-populated stretch of coastline between the resort of Puerto Vallarta and the major port of Manzanillo. Victor Hugo Romo, the head of the Jalisco state civil defense office, said several homes around the landfall area had their roofs blown off. The Puerto Vallarta city government said about a dozen trees were knocked down there. Trees were also downed in the neighboring state of Nayarit. Also Wednesday, Tropical Storm Sean formed far out in the Atlantic, but the Hurricane Center forecast that it is not likely to strengthen much. Sean had winds of 40 mph (65 kph) and was located about 780 miles (1,260 kilometers) west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. It was moving west-northwest at 13 mph (20 kph). Sean was expected to decline to a tropical depression next week without ever approaching land. ____ Follow AP’s climate coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment"

Since Thursday, at least four people have died in the storm, named Babet by the UK Meteorological Office. The latest victim was a 33-year-old woman who was killed when a tree fell on her car on the Baltic Sea island of Fehmarn on Friday afternoon, German news agency dpa reported. Three storm-related deaths were reported in England and Scotland on Thursday and Friday. Gale-force winds whipped up storm surges on the southern shores of the Baltic Sea, breaking through flood defenses in coastal areas in Denmark and northern Germany. In Flensburg, a German city just south of the border with Denmark, water levels rose more than 2 meters to the highest level recorded in a century, dpa said. Power was cut to flooded parts of the city for safety reasons. Ferry lines and railway service were temporarily suspended in affected areas in Germany, Denmark and southern Sweden. Copenhagen’s airport canceled 142 flights due to the storm on Friday but resumed operations on Saturday morning. People were evacuated from homes and campgrounds in severely hit areas in Denmark and dozens of people were without power. The municipality of Haderslev in southern Denmark decided to evacuate the entire coastline. “The situation on the coast is now so serious that it is too dangerous to stay there. All affected areas are evacuated and the emergency response is pulling out its crews,” the municipality said in a Facebook post late Friday. It wasn't immediately clear how many people were affected. The Danish Meteorological Institute warned of strong winds and elevated water levels throughout the weekend. In Scotland, as much as 4 inches (100 mm) of rain was forecast Saturday, and several towns remained under a red weather alert, the highest level, which means there is a danger to life. Met Office meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey said parts of eastern and northern Scotland had already had a month and a half’s worth of rain during the storm, with more downpours coming that could “push those areas close towards two months of rain in the span of three days.” In the worst-hit town of Brechin, residents of more than 300 homes were told to leave before the River South Esk breached its banks Friday, surging almost 4 meters (13 feet) above its usual level and sending water pouring into the streets. The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency warned a second major river, the Don, could breach on Saturday. Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf said, “unfortunately, it is clear we have not seen the last of this storm.” The storm brought disruption across the U.K., with several main roads and rail lines shut by flooding. Leeds-Bradford Airport in northern England remained closed Saturday."

COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Gale-force winds and floods struck several countries in northern Europe as the region endured more heavy rain on Friday that forecasters say will continue into the weekend. Three deaths in the U.K. were blamed on the bad weather. The winds are expected to hit hardest in the eastern part of Denmark's Jutland peninsula and the Danish islands in the Baltic Sea. But the northern part of the British Isles, southern Sweden and Norway, and northern Germany are also in the path of the storm, named Babet by U.K.'s weather forecaster, the Met Office. Eastern Scotland continued to bear the brunt of the stormy weather. On Friday, the Met Office issued a new ""red"" warning, its highest, for parts of the region through Saturday. ""This is not usual autumn weather,"" said Andy Page, the Met's chief meteorologist. ""This is an exceptional event, and we are likely to continue to see significant impacts with the potential for further flooding and damage to properties."" On Friday, police reported that a man in his 60s died after getting caught in fast-flowing flood water in the central England county of Shropshire. In Scotland, a 57-year-old woman died Thursday after being swept into a river in the region of Angus, where hundreds of homes were also evacuated. Also on Thursday, a 56-year-old man died after his van hit a falling tree in the same area. Though forecasters said the worst of the heavy rain in Scotland had passed, they warned that conditions will remain difficult, with river levels still on the rise and flood defenses breached. Some parts of the town of Brechin are only accessible by boat after its flood defenses were overwhelmed by the heavy rainfall, raising concerns about further loss of life. ""I cannot stress how dangerous conditions are in Brechin in particular,"" said Scotland's first minister, Humza Yousaf. Wind gusts in excess of 60 mph (100 kph) were likely on Friday. Several major road sections and rail routes were closed in Scotland, while air passengers were facing flight cancellations. The storm has already brought more than a month's worth of rain in the worst-affected regions in Scotland and was pummeling many parts of England on Friday. At Leeds Bradford Airport, a flight arriving from the Greek island of Corfu skidded off the runway while landing in windy conditions. There were no reported injuries and ensuing arrivals were diverted to other airports.

""We are working with the airline, relevant operations teams and emergency authorities to address this situation and remove passengers from the aircraft safely,"" a spokesperson for the airport said. In northeastern England, a lighthouse at the mouth of the River Tyne lost its distinctive red and white dome. Port of Tyne officials said it was not yet safe to assess the damage to the South Shields lighthouse while weather conditions remained dangerous. The swirling weather system was also hitting other parts of Northern Europe, particularly Denmark. The Danish Meteorological Institute wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that it expects water levels ""to exceed the 100-year event in several places."" Police in southern Denmark — the Danish region expected to be the worst hit — said a number of sections of road in low-lying areas were flooded and some trees had fallen. Police said a dike was breached and urged people to immediately leave Sandersvig Strand on the Jutland peninsula. Danish meteorologists issued their highest warning for ""very dangerous weather"" and said levels of some inland waters were expected to rise up to 240 centimeters (nearly eight feet) above normal. In neighboring Sweden, meteorologists warned of the risk of extensive flooding which may cause limited access on roads and railways along the southern coasts of the Scandinavian country. Water levels were expected to begin dropping again on Saturday morning, Swedish meteorologists said. A bridge near Norway's second-largest city was protectively closed, the Bergens Tidende newspaper said. Ferries across the region were canceled and air traffic was hampered, with delays and a few cancellations. The Swedish Transportation Authority suspended service of several train and bus lines in southern Sweden, because of the weather, prompting Skanetrafiken, the operator of the local transit system, to recommend ""avoiding travel on public transport."" ""Some regional bus routes will be canceled and there is a risk that both regional and replacement buses in service may also be canceled at short notice,"" Skanetrafiken said on its website. In Germany, some streets and squares were flooded in the cities of Flensburg, Kiel and Wismar on the Baltic coast. Fallen trees caused some disruption, including a railway line. Ferry operator Scandlines suspended services on its Roedby-Puttgarden and Gedser-Rostock routes between Denmark and Germany. On Germany's North Sea coast, the high winds had the opposite effect to the flooding on the Baltic coast, pushing the water further out and leading to very low water levels. Ferries to some North Sea islands were canceled."

The storm is causing disruption across the country, including: In the East Midlands, heavy rain is causing disruption, with roads blocked by flooding and fallen trees, and across the West Midlands schools are shut and several roads are impassable. The East Midlands has also had reports of cars being stranded in deep water, including in Ashbourne, Derbyshire. Schools have been shut in the West Midlands, Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire, in many cases due to flooding on nearby roads. There has been flooding in parts of the east of England, with residents in Hemsby in Norfolk nervously watching high tide. The village has been ravaged by coastal erosion and residents fear more land could be lost, along with properties. However, there were reports the village had avoided the worst at high tide at 11:21. BBC Radio Norfolk reporter Andrew Turner, who is at the site, said the sea was still rough, but had receded after high tide. ""I have seen lumps of sand and marram grass coming down from the cliff and going across the beach into the water,"" he said. ""There has been some erosion but I haven't heard of anything that has had an effect on property.""

After a while, the vehicle becomes stuck. Economou points to the hillside above, 500 metres (yards) high, eaten into by Storm Daniel that struck central Greece this month. ""There used to be an apple orchard there. All the trees were carried away by the flood,"" the 53-year-old tells AFP. ""Some people will not be able to reach their fields at all. They will get zero income this year,"" Economou adds. The deluge caused by Storm Daniel three weeks ago, unleashing months' worth of rain in just hours, destroyed roads and bridges, drowned tens of thousands of farm animals and left 17 people dead. ""I lost 100 trees at one of my farms,"" says Antonis Laskos, 62. ""They were uprooted and ended up in the sea."" Zagora is Greece's apple powerhouse, with a farm cooperative that dates to 1916. Some 800 families have built their lives on the fruit. The area's Zagorin apples -- a Starking Delicious variety introduced from California in the early 1950s -- have since 1996 carried a protected European designation of origin label. The villagers of Zagora, the area which produces some of Greece's finest apples, say up to 80 percent of the local road network has been knocked out and will not be easy to replace. And even the surviving crop is hard to bring in, as the only bridge left standing in the area cannot sustain the 45-ton trucks normally used for transport, according to cooperative head Yiannis Kravvaris. ""Smaller trucks will have to be used, and this will push up costs significantly,"" he notes. ""There are rebuilding efforts but the damage is so extensive that it's impossible to fix everything,"" says Ioulia Papoulia, an agronomist in charge of quality control at the Zagorin farm co-operative. ""Last year we had 18.5 million apples. This year we'll be lucky to get five million kilos,"" she says. The Athens Observatory put Zagora at the epicentre of the storm. From September 4-8, the observatory recorded 1,096 millimetres of rain -- including over 750 millimetres on September 5. The average rainfall in the area is 150 millimetres. The previous maximum in Zagora was 231 millimetres in 2018. This week, another storm named Elias dumped an additional 96 millimetres of water. Harvester Costas Zervas, 50, says this year's apple crop was already problematic owing to climate change. ""We had frequent rain in June that caused disease. ""And the winter was mild. Apple trees need the cold, from 800 to 1,600 hours of frost annually,"" Zervas explains. Facing a barrage of criticism at a perceived failure in cooperation between the army and civil protection in the hours following the disaster, the government has pledged over two billion euros ($2.1 billion) in reconstruction funds. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who comfortably won re-election and a second four-year term in June, has warned Greece is facing a ""climate war"". ""Over a two-week period, we experienced the worst wildfire and the worst floods in our history,"" Mitsotakis said this month. Fires across Greece killed at least 26 people this summer, most of them migrants trapped in a forest near the northeastern border with Turkey. A massive blaze in the Dadia National Park in northeastern Greece that burned for over two weeks was later described by the European Commission as the largest on record in Europe."

Credit: Cécile MiramontThe tree trunks, which are subfossils—remains whose fossilization process is not complete—were sliced into tiny single tree-rings. Analysis of these individual rings identified an unprecedented spike in radiocarbon levels occurring precisely 14,300 years ago. By comparing this radiocarbon spike with measurements of beryllium, a chemical element found in Greenland ice cores, the team proposes that the spike was caused by a massive solar storm that would have ejected huge volumes of energetic particles into Earth's atmosphere.Edouard Bard, Professor of Climate and Ocean Evolution at the Collège de France and CEREGE, and lead author of the study, said, ""Radiocarbon is constantly being produced in the upper atmosphere through a chain of reactions initiated by cosmic rays. Recently, scientists have found that extreme solar events includingsolar flaresandcoronal mass ejectionscan also create short-term bursts of energetic particles which are preserved as huge spikes in radiocarbon production occurring over the course of just a single year.""The researchers say that the occurrence of similar massive solar storms today could be catastrophic for modern technological society, potentially wiping out telecommunications,satellite systemsand electricity grids—and costing us billions of pounds. They warn that it is critical to understand the future risks of events like this, to enable us to prepare, build resilience into our communications and energy systems and shield them from potential damage.Tim Heaton, Professor of Applied Statistics in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds, said, ""Extreme solar storms could have huge impacts on Earth. Such super storms could permanently damage the transformers in our electricity grids, resulting in huge and widespread blackouts lasting months. They could also result in permanent damage to the satellites that we all rely on for navigation and telecommunication, leaving them unusable. They would also create severe radiation risks to astronauts.""Nine such extreme solar storms—known as Miyake Events—have now been identified as having occurred over the last 15,000 years. The most recent confirmed Miyake Events occurred in 993 AD and 774 AD. This newly-identified 14,300-year-old storm is, however, the largest that has ever been found—roughly twice the size of these two.Tree rings of a buried subfossil tree in the Drouzet river. Credit: Cécile MiramontThe exact nature of these Miyake Events remains very poorly understood as they have never been directly observed instrumentally. They highlight that we still have much to learn about the behavior of the sun and the dangers it poses to society on Earth. We do not know what causes such extreme solar storms to occur, how frequently they might occur, or if we can somehow predict them.Professor Bard said, ""Direct instrumental measurements of solar activity only began in the 17th century with the counting of sunspots. Nowadays, we also obtain detailed records using ground-based observatories, space probes, and satellites. However, all these short-term instrumental records are insufficient for a complete understanding of the sun. Radiocarbon measured in tree-rings, used alongside beryllium in polar ice cores, provide the best way to understand the sun's behavior further back into the past.""The largest, directly-observed, solar storm occurred in 1859 and is known as the Carrington Event. It caused massive disruption on Earth—destroying telegraph machines and creating a night-time aurora so bright that birds began to sing, believing the sun had begun to rise. However, the Miyake Events (including the newly discovered 14,300-yr-oldstorm) would have been a staggering entire order-of-magnitude greater in size.Subfossil trees in the banks of the Drouzet river. Credit: Cécile MiramontProfessor Heaton said, ""Radiocarbon provides a phenomenal way of studying Earth's history and reconstructing critical events that it has experienced. A precise understanding of our past is essential if we want to accurately predict our future and mitigate potential risks. We still have much to learn. Each new discovery not only helps answer existing key questions but can also generate new ones.""Cécile Miramont, Associate Professor of Paleoenvironments and Paleoclimates at IMBE, Aix-en-Provence University, said, ""Finding such a collection of preserved trees was truly exceptional.

Because of their size and their need to swim far and dive deep, many scientists who study orcas argue that it's inhumane to keep them in captivity. ""The goal is to improve thewelfare of the animals,"" Naomi Rose, marine mammal scientist for the Animal Welfare Institute, told Insider. ""And being in a natural habitat is always going to be better for these animals than being in a concrete box."" Rose points to years of research showing theconsequences of captivity, including hyperaggression, dorsal fin collapse in male orcas, repetitive patterns, like swimming in circles and regurgitating food, and severe tooth damage from chewing on concrete tanks and steel bars. Captive orcas can also show signs of chronic stress. Public pressure torelease captive orcashas grown in recent years, yet at least 54 remain in captivity around the world — 18 in the US at SeaWorld parks. SeaWorld announced in 2016 that it wouldend its orca breeding programdue in part to the backlash it received following the 2013 documentary ""Blackfish."" The orcas currently in the company's care will be thelast generation of killer whalesat the park. Activists are advocating for their release. But the question of where and how to release them continues to fuel debate aboutwhat's best for these killer whales. Orcas raised in captivity are likely to struggle if released into the open ocean, Monika Wieland Shields, co-founder and director of the Orca Behavior Institute, told Insider. ""Captive orcas may have a hard time adapting tocatching wild preyas they never received training from their families,"" Shields said. ""And hunting tactics are unique to orcas in every different population."" Many orcas raised in captivity also have health problems that could require ongoing human care and treatment. Those born and raised in captivity or who have been in captivity for decades are also at risk of coming into contact with infectious diseases their immune systems aren't prepared for, Chris Dold, chief zoological officer at SeaWorld, told Insider. ""We know wild whales and dolphinscarry certain viruses and bacterial infectionsthat our whales and dolphins have never ever been exposed to,"" Dold said. ""And so their immune systems would presumably not be developed in such a way that they could fight that disease off."" Only one captive orca in the US has ever been released back into the ocean — Keiko, the orca who starred in the 1993 film ""Free Willy."" Efforts to rehabilitate Keiko began shortly after the film's huge success, and in 1996 he was transferred from a tank in Mexico City to a rehabilitation facility in Oregon. There, Keiko was placed in a pool filled with ocean water and introduced to live fish for hunting. His health improved, and he gained 1,900 pounds in 18 months. In 1998, he was transferred to a sea pen — a large part of the ocean marked off for rehabilitated marine animals to live — in Iceland where he continued to receive medical care from human caretakers. Keiko first stayed in his sea pen as he acclimated to life in the ocean, but eventually was able to swim in the open ocean with the help of human guide boats. In the summer of 2002, he traveled 1,000 miles to the coast of Norway. Keiko had many encounters with wild orcas but struggled to fully integrate with them. In 2003, five years after his release, Keiko died of pneumonia at the age of 27. Wild male orcas typically live about 35 to 50 years. Because Keiko wasn't able to integrate with wild orcas, critics of the effort describe his release as a failure. But animal rights activists say Keiko was able to regain his health after years in captivity, and while his death was premature, he had years of freedom in the ocean. Similar plans were in place torelease the captive orca Lolita, also known as Tokitae or Toki, who had been at the Miami Seaquarium for 50 years. Butshe diedfrom complications of a suspected renal condition on August 18, 2023, before she could be moved to a sea pen in her native waters off the coast of Washington state. Keiko's story is why orca experts and animal rights activists support the creation of whale sanctuaries or sea pens. In this setting, orcas can swim free but remain close to humans who can help provide food and medical care. Sanctuaries exist for other animals that have been released from captivity, like elephants, tigers, and bears. It's harder to establish these kinds of rehabilitation spaces for large ocean creatures, like killer whales, but it can be done. Thesea pen in Icelandwhere Keiko was released now houses two beluga whales and could potentially hold other marine mammals, including killer whales, Mark Palmer, associate director of the International Marine Mammal Project, told Insider. There are also several warm-water marine mammal sanctuaries being built in the Caribbean and Mediterranean, Palmer said. Lori Marino, founder and president of the Whale Sanctuary Project, is part of an effort to build the first-of-its-kind killer whale sanctuary in Nova Scotia. Once completed, the sanctuary would occupy 100 acres of water space — big enough to fit about 75 standard American football fields. Depths in the sanctuary could reach up to 59 feet, which would allow orcas to swim farther and dive deeper than they can in marine park tanks. For example, SeaWorld orca tanks average approximately 86 feet by 51 feet with a depth of 34 feet, according to PETA. SeaWorld didn't respond to Insider's request to confirm these measurements. The WSP is working to secure final funding with plans to complete the sanctuary in 2024, Palmer said. The sanctuary would also include underwater cameras and hydrophones for members of the public to learn about and observe the orcas from a distance. ""The next step is to take these 18 remaining orcas in the US and bring them somewhere they can live out the rest of their lives in a more natural, healthy environment,"" Marino said. ""It's a way to give back what was taken from them."" Marino and other animal rights activists have urged SeaWorld to partner with them in efforts to build whale sanctuaries, but say so far the company has resisted. ""It would be unconscionable to risk the health and wellbeing of killer whales at SeaWorld by moving them to a sea pen, especially when killer whales at SeaWorld are living a healthy life in a safe and sound habitat where every need is attended to,"" SeaWorld told Insider in an email statement. Animal rights activists say specifics about the health status of the orcas at SeaWorld are hard to come by as not much of that information is made public. But Dold said the orcas routinely undergo wellness checks that include taking blood samples, running diagnostic tests, and ultrasound imaging that show they're ""thriving under SeaWorld's care."" Dold also cited concerns about potential hurricanes, oil spills, infectious diseases, and disruption of the ocean ecosystem if the orcas at SeaWorld are moved to a sanctuary. Marino said the WSP has worked to address these concerns in a few key ways, including a three-year environmental assessment, which found that allowing whales into the region would not harm the ecosystem. The WSP also chose the location in Nova Scotia specifically because of its protection from storm surges during hurricanes. And the team plans to include facilities for the whales to go to in the case of an oil spill. In terms of disease, Marino explained the team would conduct a full workup of the orcas' health and immune systems before transferring them. The whales would also have access to veterinary care at the sanctuary. Another factor to consider in this debate is what the public stands to lose if the orcas leave SeaWorld. The opportunity for people to see orcas up close and for scientists to study and learn about them has led to a greater appreciation of these animals, Dold said. Captive orcas have no doubt played a crucial role in expanding human knowledge, Shields said. For example, by studying captive orcas, scientists have been able to learn about orca gestation and metabolism — subjects that are much more difficult to research in free-ranging whales. But Shields said this isn't a reason to continue keeping these animals in captivity. ""With that increased understanding has also come increased respect and an awareness of just how much orcas suffer in a captive environment,"" Shields said. ""It's time to do right by these whales and give them the best retirement we can offer them and ultimately cease having orcas in captivity altogether."""

Recognizing this resilience, and acknowledging the challenges posed by global climate change, Rutgers scientists have come to their assistance.One of the results of recent efforts is a guide that researchers have developed for marine businesses,A Resilience Checklist for New Jersey's Commercial Fishing Industry.Lisa Auermuller, director of the Megalopolitan Coastal Transformation Hub, which is based in the Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences in the Rutgers School of Environmental and Biological Sciences (SEBS), worked with a number of Rutgers scientists on the effort, including Douglas Zemeckis, a marine extension agent, and Eleanor Bochenek, the retired director of the Fisheries Cooperative Center, and Richard Lathrop, director of Rutgers Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis.Auermuller explained the overall endeavor.What aspects of climate change have most affected New Jersey shore's commercial fisheries? Are there economic repercussions?In New Jersey, coastal fishing communities from small villages to large ports are seeing increased regular flooding, coastal storms, sea level rise and shifts in the populations of their catches. These working waterfronts are on the front lines of these impacts, experiencing damage to infrastructure and disruption to the transportation of the catch.In addition, as ocean waters warm, the range of many marine species is shifting. For example, over the past 50 years, the fall range of the summer flounder, a commercially lucrative variety, has shifted 72 miles north, shrunk in size overall by 99 total miles and descended about 22 feet. Changes in fish populations require commercial fishers to adapt in how they make a living.This affects all of us. The New Jersey commercial fishing industry brings in an estimated $4.5 billion annually from fisheries, aquaculture andrecreational fishing. If the industry is adversely impacted, so is the state's economy.How can scientists help those engaged in the commercial fishing industry to weather the effects of climate change?The Rutgers team worked with fisheries resource managers and commercial fishing industry stakeholders from the diverse ports of Belford, Barnegat Light, Cape May and Port Norris to develop the Resilience Checklist.This checklist helps commercial fishers and businesses identify opportunities to improve resilience to storms and other coastal hazards, as well as changes in the productivity and distribution of fish populations. Each section includesonline resourcesthat can be used to learn more and develop solutions to improve resilience.Although it can be used individually by onebusinessor fisher, the checklist is most effective when completed collaboratively by several fishing businesses or fishers from a New Jersey port or dock. The purpose of the checklist is to start conversation and coordination among dock managers, fishers, processors, dealers and others involved in the industry about planning and preparation to address vulnerabilities. The overall resilience of a port or dock depends on the ability of each member of its fishing community to assess and address risks.How can planning and preparation, as advised in the checklist, make a difference?Commercial fishing communities know, perhaps better than many others, that storms, floods and shoreline erosion are a natural part of living and working on the coast. Coastal hazards can damage assets, disrupt business and cause financial loss. Climate change threatens to increase the intensity and frequency of coastal hazards and changes in the fish population. Knowing that these challenges have impacted fishing businesses in the past—and will continue to cause impacts in the future—highlights the importance of planning and preparation to improve resilience.Even if a fishing vessel is unaffected by floods, the fishing business could suffer if flooding damages or prevents access to land-based infrastructure. This includes boat ramps, docks, processing facilities and vendors operating restaurants, many of which were destroyed by Superstorm Sandy. Businesses that are prepared to respond to coastal hazards can more quickly resume operations during or after a coastal hazard event. Proactively planning for recovery allows a business to implement actions and ""bounce forward"" by rebuilding in stronger, smarter, safer and more resilient ways.What happens next?Since the 1600s, New Jersey's fishing industry has continuously adapted to change. In the face of challenges on land and water, fromcoastal stormsto species shifts, commercial fisheries are resilient because they must be to survive.The checklist has been distributed to commercial fisheries, ports, docks and fisheries scientists and managers. Rutgers scientists also developed aninteractive story mapto guide checklist users as they assess coastal flooding threats via Rutgers'NJFloodMapper tool. Owners of the state's commercial fishing businesses now have a guided way to reflect on steps they have already taken to be resilient and to identify opportunities to further prepare for current and future risks.Provided byRutgers UniversityCitation: Q&A: Scientist helps fish harvesters implement adaptive strategies to climate change (2023, October 19) retrieved 3 November 2023 "

But across five continents this year, it's also unleashed a different kind of disaster: deadly flooding.Cities around the world have seen record rainfall 139 times in 2023. A rare hurricane-like storm inundated Libya last month, killing thousands. More than 100 people died across Asia during an intense monsoon season in July. After fatal floods pummeled the U.S. Northeast over the summer,torrential rainsparalyzed New York City last week.Soaring temperatures were at the root of all these weather calamities. June, July and August were the hottest ever for that period. Higher air temperatures mean the atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall, while record-hot oceans provide fuel for storms. And as the climate warms, flooding is poised to get worse.""We are now seeing record-smashing ocean temperatures, record-smashing global temperatures and record-smashing floods,"" said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center. ""It's all connected.""In the U.S., two major flood events this year—in California from January to March and the Northeast in July—killed 32 people and caused $6.7 billion in damages, according to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information. The damages are the highest since 2019, when accounting only for flood incidents totaling more than $1 billion.Global damages are difficult to tally because not all countries keep accurate records, but flood events have left more than 17,000 people dead or missing in 2023. On average, there were 216 floods or landslides worldwide per year from 2019 to 2022, compared with an average of 160 over the previous four years, according to the International Disaster Database.In large part, the ever-worsening downpours are caused by what scientists call a ""positive feedback loop.""It works like this: The Earth's temperature rises in response to greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Hotter air holds morewater vapor, which then absorbs heat and prevents it from escaping the atmosphere—resulting in even more moisture in the air and heavier rainfall.Water vapor ""traps yet more heat and sets up a vicious cycle,"" Francis said.As the atmosphere gets warmer, so have the world's oceans. Higher water temperatures heat up the air above the sea surface, generating energy for hurricanes andtropical stormsto form. The Atlantic saw 10 storms develop from Aug. 20 to Sept. 16, the most on record for that period, according to Phil Klotzbach, a Colorado State University hurricane researcher.The storm that devastated Libya last month was a ""medicane,"" a name that's an amalgamation of Mediterranean and hurricane. Theseweather systemsare smaller than large Atlantic storms but can strike with Category 1 force on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, bringing winds greater than 74 miles per hour and flooding rains.Warmer water temperatures lead ""to a lot of evaporation from the oceans and more moisture in the atmosphere, and that provides the fuel for more rainfall in general,"" said Robert Adler, a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland. ""There is not much doubt that global warming in general is pushing us toward more intense rainfall events.""The total amount of rain that falls on Earth has only increased a small amount as the climate evolves, but what's changed is the intensity, Alder said.In the past, a hypothetical city may have seen 10 storms per month, each bringing an inch of rain. Now, a singlestormcan drop 10 inches of rain, overwhelming streets, drains and buildings that weren't constructed to handle that kind of deluge.""All the storms today can tap into that extra moisture, produce more rain, and increase the chances of flooding,"" Francis said. ""Water vapor is rocket fuel for storms—more of it means they can strengthen faster and become more intense.""Amplifying ocean heat this year is the weather pattern know as El Niño, which warms the equatorial Pacific's surface.Of course, this year's extreme weather hasn't been confined to flooding: Much of the world remains under dry conditions. A massive heat wave taxed energy grids across Texas and Mexico over the summer, throwing the U.S. Great Plains and Midwest deep into drought. But the increased frequency of both drought and flooding is evidence of global warming, said Lou Gritzo, chief science officer and staff senior vice president at commercial property insurer FM Global.""These things are not unrelated,"" Gritzo said. ""We are seeing exactly what we would expect to see in a changing climate.""How people use the land also can affect the severity of floods, said Deborah Brosnan, a climate scientist and founder of environmental risk consultancy Deborah Brosnan & Associates.In Libya, deforestation, unhealthy or depleted soil and poorly maintained dams all helped turn an extreme weather event into a human catastrophe, Brosnan said.But the risks aren't confined to developing nations. Climate change combined with urbanization all over the globe means higher rainfall, more pavement and fewer places for all that water to go when it hits the ground.""There is no area that is immune to this,"" Gritzo said.

The aftermath of the disaster on September 10-11 has seen the rival camps in the east and west of the war-scarred country both announce their own plans for a reconstruction conference. The United Nations, Western governments and international observers warn that Libya's dysfunctional politics are hampering efforts to help the tens of thousands of displaced survivors rebuild their lives. The UN mission chief in Libya, Abdoulaye Bathily, stressed Monday that the competing efforts ""are counterproductive, deepen the existing divisions in the country (and) impede reconstruction efforts"". The United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy backed his call for ""a unified Libyan national mechanism"" coordinated with international partners ""to deliver transparent and accountable relief"". Claudia Gazzini of think-tank the International Crisis Group warned that Libya's two rival administrations might ""use this crisis in opportunistic ways"", including by possibly diverting funds. ""There are already signs of turf wars (and corresponding disinformation campaigns) between the rivals over who should take charge of reconstruction efforts,"" she warned. The humanitarian needs are enormous in the devastated eastern city of Derna, where a huge flash flood broke through two upstream dams and swept entire neighbourhoods into the Mediterranean, leaving behind an apocalyptic wasteland. Local authorities have declared a death toll of 3,845, but have yet to release an official figure of how many people remain missing -- a number international aid groups put at around 10,000 in the first days after the disaster. The scale of the destruction was blamed on the sheer volume of the rains brought by hurricane-strength Storm Daniel, and on the impact Libya's years of chaos have had on critical infrastructure, early-warning systems and emergency response. The oil-rich North African nation has been in turmoil ever since a 2011 NATO-backed popular uprising led to the overthrow and killing of longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi. Years of fighting followed involving myriad tribal militia, jihadists and foreign mercenaries as the country also became a gateway for Europe-bound irregular migrants, many of whom have suffered severe human rights abuses in Libya. Libya now remains split between two former battlefield enemies: a UN-backed government based in the capital Tripoli in the west, and the disaster-hit east, backed by military strongman Khalifa Haftar. Haftar is close to Russia and its Wagner mercenary group and to the oil-rich United Arab Emirates, which led the early disaster relief effort. After the flood, the eastern government was quick to invite the ""international community"" for a donor conference scheduled for October 10, an announcement met with scepticism abroad. It has since postponed the meeting until November 1. Eastern officials have also distributed cheques for aid and compensation to mayors of flood-hit municipalities, an effort documented in photos published online. The Libyan parliament, based in the major eastern city of Benghazi, meanwhile announced it had allocated 1.9 billion euros for reconstruction, without specifying how it would be spent. Illustrating the institutional chaos, it was Libya's western-based government that announced around 18 million euros in aid for flood-damaged schools in the east. US ambassador Richard Norland cautioned that ""the Libyans must establish the structures that bring authorities from across the country together to agree on priority expenditures and ensure funds are efficiently and properly allocated"". ""We urge Libyan authorities now to form such unified structures -- rather than launching separate efforts -- that represent the Libyan people without delay."" The UN's Bathily said that ""the Libyan people have expressed their concerns about arbitrary cost estimates and unilateral reconstruction initiatives announced without transparency and buy-in from all relevant authorities and stakeholders"". He urged ""a unified national mechanism"" to steer a speedy reconstruction effort ""based on a credible, independent and objective assessment of the damage and needs, professionally determined cost estimates, and transparent contracting and procurement processes."" More broadly, Bathily called for renewed efforts toward national unity and elections, stressing that ""the impact of Storm Daniel also underscores the imperative to expedite negotiations on breaking the political stalemate""."

Extreme rainfall from hurricane-strength Storm Daniel caused two upstream dams to burst on September 10, sending flood waters that have been likened to a tsunami crashing through the middle of Derna. The deluge razed entire neighbourhoods, dividing the port city and sweeping many people into the Mediterranean and to their deaths. ""Derna, today, is broken in two. It's a reflection of what its inhabitants feel,"" said Mayssam Hasedi, who lost more than 20 relatives in the flash floods. More than 4,000 people have been reported dead and thousands more remain missing in eastern Libya, according to authorities. After days of clinging to the hope of finding survivors, Derna's inhabitants now despair watching the continuous arrival of lifeless bodies recovered at sea. ""Almost everyone in the city is in mourning and suffering,"" said Michel-Olivier Lacharite, the head of emergencies at the medical charity Doctors Without Borders. ""Some children refuse to drink water for fear of drowning,"" he said, after meeting flood survivors in Derna. ""Patients complained of flashbacks, of not being able to sleep between 2:30 am and 5:00 am -- the time when the deadly wave engulfed the city."" Last month's flood was the latest catastrophe to strike the oil-rich North African country that has been wracked by war and lawlessness since a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 ousted and killed longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi. The psychological impact of the disaster will also be felt for a long time among rescuers, especially divers who recovered hundreds of lifeless bodies, according to aid groups. The World Health Organization has said ""tremendous mental health needs are emerging, and will continue to emerge, as the initial shock of the devastation and loss they have experienced begins to dissipate."" The International Rescue Committee (IRC) on Tuesday warned of the ""immense psychological toll the emergency is taking on those affected, particularly in the city of Derna, one of the areas hardest-hit."" The aid group deployed medical teams on the ground after the disaster, including mental health professionals, to respond to the crisis. It says it is working with Libya's health ministry to establish a mental health unit. ""With entire neighbourhoods swept from the ground, taking care of the mental wellbeing of those affected must go hand in hand with providing basic services,"" said Elie Abouaoan, the IRC's Libya country director. Children, who are traumatised by displacement and the loss of their homes and loved ones, are particularly impacted. UNICEF's partners had ""reported several instances of suicides, withdrawal, lack of sleep, bed wetting... among children, especially in shelters"", said the United Nations children's agency. In addition, dozens of minors have become wards of the state after their families perished in the flood, authorities say. More than 42,000 people remain displaced, according to the latest figures from the International Organization for Migration. The authorities' priority now is the reconstruction of Derna, its buildings, and its bridges, but it must go hand in hand with the social and mental reconstruction of its traumatised inhabitants who need short and long-term support to accept and manage the unacceptable, according to specialists. As attention turns to rebuilding the destroyed city of Derna, experts say authorities must also pay attention to rebuilding the spirit of city's shattered community. International Medical Corps has announced agreements with Libyan authorities to provide medical follow-up and train medical personnel to provide psychological support to residents of Derna. But the extent of the devastation that struck the heart of the city has rendered most service infrastructures unusable, and the hospitals, at least those still standing, are no longer able to accommodate patients. But many of the city's medical facilities no longer stand, leaving Derna's traumatised residents few places to go to for psychological support."

There are three main accusations: Firstly, residents of Derna, the hardest-hit town, say they were told to stay at home rather than being evacuated even though it was known that Storm Daniel was coming. Secondly, local and regional authorities are accused of failing to address the danger posed by the dams on the Derna riverbed, which runs through the town. Two dams spanning the Derna valley inland from the city burst on 11 September, causing the catastrophic flooding. Finally, the authorities are accused of hindering the aid effort in the days immediately after the tragedy. Anger in Derna escalated into protests on 18 September and the home of the mayor - who later resigned - was subsequently burned down. The death toll remains unknown, with many bodies believed to have been washed out to sea. At least 4,000 people have been confirmed dead and another 10,000 reported missing in a town with a population of about 90,000. Since the fall of long-time Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, the country has been divided between a UN-backed government in the capital, Tripoli, and a rival authority backed by military strongman General Khalifa Haftar, whose forces control eastern Libya, including Derna. Ahead of the arrival of Storm Daniel, various bodies in the east held emergency meetings and subsequently issued instructions to the region's residents. These generally focused on the evacuation of coastal and low-lying areas in Derna, and stay-at-home orders for other parts of the city and wider region. But residents have told BBC Arabic that evacuation efforts were inadequate in a number of respects: Residents of the town were generally instructed to stay indoors. People living in specific areas on the seafront or close to the riverbed were ordered to leave their homes but there was no comprehensive or consistent list of areas to be evacuated. Local residents told the BBC that some people who were evacuated from the seafront because of fears of rising sea levels were moved to more dangerous areas that were later flooded. ""There were no warnings of possible flooding, just that the sea levels might rise,"" a local engineer told the BBC. ""Only those by the beach were asked to evacuate, but the rest of the city was asked to stay indoors."" The man, who has chosen to remain anonymous In fear of reprisal, lost his wife and two of his sons in the tragedy. He added that just a few hours before the flooding, a force from the interior ministry was going around asking people to stay indoors. ""Many of those that evacuated from the beaches went into central Derna, where they were killed by the later flooding,"" he said. Preparations actually began well in advance of the disaster. On 9 September - two days before the devastating flood - the eastern government convened an emergency committee meeting and declared the following two days national holidays to encourage people to stay at home. A curfew was declared in the region from 20:00 that evening and orders were given for the evacuation of ""areas near the sea and low-lying areas located in the valleys of Benghazi and the entire eastern region"". The announcements generally called for people to move to ""safe places"", without specifying where they should go. On the same day, the mayor of Derna made a similar call to evacuate various seafront and low-lying neighbourhoods. But by 10 September, online announcements and video statements posted by the Derna police had dropped any mention of evacuation, and were focusing on the curfew and making sure people stayed at home. Photos geolocated by the BBC show police patrols out on the roads following another official announcement which imposed a curfew ""inside the city as a precaution to prevent emergency, especially areas near the beach"". This proclamation came via a Facebook post, and many residents of Derna have complained that television and social media were insufficient means to alert people, especially given the disruption in the aftermath of Storm Daniel. Red Crescent staff were also active in coastal areas in the days ahead of the flood - videos show them calling on people via megaphone to clear their homes to stay safe from Storm Daniel. So notable efforts were made to move residents in some areas of the city, but all of these evacuations anticipated that the threat would come from rising sea levels, rather than the failure of infrastructure far inland and the Derna valley flooding. Derna residents reported hearing a loud blast before the city was engulfed - the failure of one or both of the two dams which had until then been holding back the floodwaters in the valley. The upper dam had a storage capacity of 1.5 million cubic metres of water, while the lower dam could hold 22.5 million cubic metres. Each cubic metre of water weighs about one tonne (1,000kg), so the water held back by the dams weighed a total of 24 million tonnes. As that weight moved downhill, it produced enormous power. Witnesses have said the water was nearly three metres high in places. Public pronouncements by officials in Derna or the eastern government made no reference to the potential overflow or collapse of the two dams serving the city, focusing instead on the dangers of strong winds and potentially rising water levels. Dr Abdulwanis Ashour, a hydrologist and lecturer at Omar Al-Mukhtar University, told the BBC he had collected data on the condition of the Derna dams for a study published last year, which showed they were not prepared to withstand a storm like Daniel. He said he had spent years studying the Derna dams and had discovered the presence of numerous cracks and fissures. In his research, he asserted that they would not be able to handle a large amount of rainfall and were at risk of collapse. Dr Ashour pointed out that studies and reports had been conducted by local and international entities over the years, all of which warned about the condition of the Derna dams and their danger to nearby areas. He affirmed that successive governments were aware of these reports. On Monday 25 September, Libya's Public Prosecutor's Office, part of the western government, ordered the arrest of 16 officials responsible for managing Libya's dams as part of investigations into negligence regarding dam maintenance and other flood-related work. But it is not clear if any of them have actually been arrested. The emergency response of the Derna authorities has also been widely criticised. In a rare sign of unity in the divided country, pleas for help from the stricken town were answered as a multitude of aid workers immediately set about delivering supplies from cities under the control of the rival government in the west. But these convoys were stopped and denied access into Derna. BBC Arabic has been told that this was due to tight security measures invoked immediately after the disaster by the eastern authorities, which led to delays in aid for thousands of survivors for days afterwards. ""Nothing and no-one gets in without their permission,"" one Libyan aid worker told the BBC. This aid worker - originally from Derna - lost several friends and relatives to the floods. They work for the Libyan Red Crescent - the only aid agency allowed to work in Derna in the early days of the crisis - and so were one of few aid workers granted access to the city from day one. ""Haftar and his troops only trust the Red Crescent, but we couldn't do much as the crisis was so big. We needed all the help we could get,"" said the aid worker, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, for fear of being targeted by Gen Haftar's troops. ""Haftar put security before rescue, and political differences before helping devastated Derna residents,"" the aid worker said, adding that Gen Haftar's forces denied immediate access to volunteers coming from western Libyaand halted delivery of aid supplies for days. They say that security forces spent hours scrutinising much-needed aid supplies looking for ""weapons that could be smuggled into the city"". Gen Haftar has been in control of Derna since 2018, but he only took it after Islamists linked to Islamic State had held out against his forces for three years. One local resident told the BBC he thought the city ""was still getting punished"" for this resistance. Whatever the motivation, Derna's residents were left for days with no food, clean water or medical supplies, while vital aid supplies were withheld and stored for inspection. It is impossible to know how many lives were lost as a result. The BBC also spoke to the leader of an aid convoy sent from the west of the country, who recounted a similar story. Abdel Monem Kheresha from Tripoli said his convoy was prevented from entering Derna. ""We were stopped before Derna's entrances and we were ordered by the 'Libyan National Army' [LNA, Gen Haftar's militia] to hand over our supplies,"" said Mr Kheresha. The BBC has found that aid supplies gathered from such convoys were stored in two main warehouses supervised by the LNA, one in Benghazi and the other in al-Marj. They were carefully inspected and then distributed by the LNA, an operation that took hours and even days. It wasn't until Thursday 14 September, when the size of the catastrophe was apparent to the whole world, that a long queue of trucks carrying aid from around the country was allowed into the city. Derna resident Al-No'man Ali told the BBC that they finally received food and aid supplies on the Friday after the disaster, after days of waiting. After the protests began on 18 September, many local and international journalists in the city were forced to leave after coming under pressure from the authorities. At the same time, communications in the city went down - many protesters believe they were deliberately cut to stop the demonstrations from escalating. The lack of mobile phone signal and internet hindered the rescue and aid work in the city as the different international and local teams that were eventually allowed to operate there couldn't coordinate their work. The BBC has approached the east Libyan authorities for comment on those allegations, but has not received a response. Additional reporting by Ali Al Gomati, Mark Shea and Florence Dixon."

Cars were swept away as the River Bisenzio flooded and people climbed on roofs to escape the deluge. Hospitals were flooded, people in cars were trapped in underpasses and the west coast was lashed by high waves. The extreme conditions are directly linked to Storm Ciarán which has caused more than 13 deaths in Western Europe. Winds of 207km/h (129 mph) were recorded earlier on the north-west coast of France, as the storm also lashed southern England, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, as well as the Atlantic coast of Spain and Portugal. Power lines went down and transport was severely disrupted. A five-year-old child was one of two people killed in Belgium by falling trees. Residents had to be evacuated from their homes on the Channel Island of Jersey. A cold front of severe weather reached Tuscany on Thursday night, as winds reached 140km/h. Regional governor Eugenio Giani described the heavy rain as ""unprecedented in the past 100 years and, after a cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni declared a state of emergency for the worst-hit areas of Tuscany. Livorno and Marina di Pisa on the coast and towns around Florence were among the worst affected areas, with the streets of Prato looking more like canals and nearby Seano resembling an island. In Montemurlo, officials said on Friday that 200mm (7.8in) of rain had fallen since Thursday afternoon and the Bisenzio river burst its banks in two places. An 85-year-old man was found dead on the ground floor of his flooded home. Rescuers believe he had been unable to climb the stairs to safety. The governor of Tuscany shared a video showing cars being swept away by floodwater and appealed for people to go to upper floors. Close to the river, in Campi Bisenzio, people climbed on to their roofs to get to safety and about 100 staff and customers sought refuge in a shopping centre. A man and his wife were found dead after his car overturned in floodwater in Vinci, to the west of Florence. There had been fears that the River Arno would flood in Florence but the emergency appeared to have subsided by mid-morning. The mayor of Prato, Matteo Biffoni, described overnight events as a ""blow to the stomach"". Floods left entire areas submerged and the ground floor of the town's Santo Stefano hospital was partially flooded. The west coast was lashed by waves reaching 3.5m (11ft 5in), and Milan was hit by flooding for a second time this week, three days after the River Seveso burst its banks. The storm also caused damage in the north-eastern region of Veneto, where one person was missing and Governor Luca Zaia said 160mm of rain had fallen in 24 hours. Further east, there were red weather alerts in Slovenia and Croatia. Forecasters warned of high winds, hail and thunderstorms and authorities in Slovenia warned of one of the strongest cyclones in the past 10 years.

Nearly 150,000 homes were left without power after the severe weather caused widespread flooding and damage. Jersey recorded hurricane-force gusts of more than 100mph (161km/h). While the worst of the weather is now over, rain and ""violent"" winds are forecast for some parts of the UK this weekend, though a ""risk to life"" warning has been downgraded in Wales. A yellow rain warning expired for north-eastern Scotland at 17:00 GMT on Friday. A separate warning for the entire south coast of England will come into effect from 05:00 until the end of the day on Saturday, with 30-40mm of rainfall possible in coastal areas. No deaths have so far been linked to the storm in the UK, but there have been at least 13 fatalities in mainland Europe. In Wales, a severe flood warning around the Kiln Park caravan site in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, was downgraded at 16:46 to a flood warning, after previously cautioning that there was a ""significant risk to life and disruption to the community is expected"". However, there are fears that the next high tide, just after 21:30 on Friday, could raise the near-record level of the River Ritec further, bringing additional disruption. The caravan site has been already been evacuated. Two separate flood alerts - meaning flooding is possible - are in place in Wales, with stwo more in Scotland. Some 38 English flood warnings - meaning flooding is expected - remain in force, largely across the south of the country, with a further 167 flood alerts stretching northwards, up to near Scarborough. By Friday afternoon, Ciarán was moving away from the UK. BBC Weather meteorologist Helen Willetts said the remains of the storm, in the North Sea, is now much weaker. She explained that it would will bring heavy, blustery showers but added that drier, sunnier spells can be expected in between. Ms Willetts continued: ""However, in eastern and north-east Scotland, the rain will be persistent and occasionally heavy. Then overnight and through tomorrow (Saturday), more rain will push across England and Wales, and possibly eastern Northern Ireland as the wind picks up in the south. ""So again, it's the rain that is likely to cause more flooding and disruption as the ground is already saturated from the record breaking rainfall we have already seen in parts this October."" Schools in Jersey - which saw some of Thursday's worst weather - remained closed for a second day on Friday and aim to reopen on Monday. Schools on the neighbouring islands of Guernsey and Alderney reopened on Friday, with the exception of the College of Further Education. Jersey's airport was expected to remain closed to commercial flights until at least early on Friday afternoon due to storm damage. Dozens of people on the island were evacuated to hotels overnight on Wednesday and locals were also hit by huge hailstones ""bigger than golf balls"". The Met Office described the Channel Islands as having endured ""supercell thunderstorms"". Locals also faced hurricane-force winds, Jersey Met confirmed. Forecaster Matt Winter told BBC Radio Jersey that eastern parts of the island were ""briefly"" affected by a tornado. A clip from St Clement in Jersey showed Jessica O'Reilly sleeping in bed alongside her baby when the sound of the ""weather bomb"" woke her - seconds before the window was blown inwards. She described the moment her ""motherly instinct"" kicked in, telling the BBC: ""We went up to bed and could hear the wind getting stronger and stronger, closer and closer. ""Something didn't seem right, then the windows just smashed in, I grabbed [my daughter] and got out the room. ""I think I just thought 'my baby's in danger, I need to get out' and ran down the stairs."" Student Kate Marsh told the BBC she was woken at 05:30 when the roof of her bedroom in Falmouth, Cornwall, entirely blew off and collapsed onto her. In Northern Ireland, a flooding recovery operation is under way in Newry and Newcastle following heavy rain earlier this week, while an emergency response continues in Downpatrick, Co Down. The Department for Infrastructure said it did not expect to be able to work to reduce the floodwater in Downpatrick until Friday, when river levels have dropped. A spokesperson for the department said rivers in some areas had reached record levels and remained very high. The damage caused by flooding in Downpatrick has ""ripped the heart out of the town"", a local businessman told the BBC. Elsewhere across the British Isles, roofs were blown off homes, some train lines completely ground to a halt and there were long queues around the Port of Dover, which shut earlier amid rough seas. Roughly 146,000 homes - mostly in the south of England - were left without power, and by 08:00 on Friday around 600 properties still had no electricity. A spokesperson for the Energy Networks Association (ENA) said: ""While difficult conditions remain, with violent winds forecast until the end of the day, teams from across the country are working together to continue to reconnect customers where it is safe to do so."" Some rail services remain disrupted, with LNER - the main train operator on the East Coast Main Line between London King's Cross and Edinburgh Waverley - advising passengers not to travel until Saturday, amid a significant number of expected delays and cancellations. Several other train operators, notably in Devon and Cornwall, also warned of disruption on Friday while debris from Storm Ciarán was cleared from the tracks, but normal service has resumed elsewhere. Meanwhile, a section of West Bay cliff in Dorset collapsed onto a beach after it was hit by huge waves. And in Leatherhead, Surrey, a local football club has been swamped by flood water, putting a home game on Saturday afternoon in major doubt. Western Europe has also been battered, with at least 13 deaths linked to the storm. France, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, Croatia and Slovenia were all hit, while in Belgium a five-year-old boy was killed by a falling branch in the town of Ghent. In the Italian region of Tuscany, six people lost their lives as a result of the severe conditions, with several others missing and a number of hospitals flooded. Specialists in flooding have suggested the UK needs to be more proactive when making plans to avert the impact of storms. Prof Hannah Cloke, who specialises in hydrology at the University of Reading, says building resilience to storms requires action when the ""going is good, and that can seem expensive and unnecessary to many people when the sun is shining"". Trevor Hoey, a professor of river science at Brunel University and director of the Centre for Flood Risk and Resilience, added that there is risk of being reactive and waiting ""until there has been a flood event and then we try to stop that event from occurring again in the same place in the future"". Experts say a warming atmosphere increases the chance of intense rainfall and storms. However, many factors contribute to extreme weather and it takes time for scientists to calculate how much impact climate change has had on particular events - if any. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

Walking down Queen St today you could be forgiven for thinking that the greatest storm for 35 years had missed St Helier entirely. The shops are bustling, groups of children enjoying another day off school dodge between the benches and the sun glistens warmly off the big glass windows of department stores. You have to look very closely to see the fragments of slate and small branches that have been left after the clean-up this morning. But just a few streets away, on the outskirts of town, it's a different story. A huge tree leans drunkenly against a block of flats. Piles of chainsawed branches are piled haphazardly on pavements and driveways, after the workmen cleared them out of the road to allow traffic to pass before moving on to the next blockage. Drivers take it in turn to slalom around the trunks which have been left sticking out into the road. Mothers struggle with their children's pushchairs over pavements that are strewn with debris and slick with wet leaves. At Les Quennevais, I saw members of the Petanque Club inside their clubroom, adorned with trophies and books, staring forlornly up at the sky through what's left of the roof. People gather in knots to discuss what happened and tell their tales of lost tiles, broken windows and collapsed walls. They all say it's been a time of unity, when neighbours have turned out to help with wheelbarrows, saws or just cups of tea. Strong wind is a regular feature of island life. But in 30 years of broadcasting, I've never had to use the words tornado or hurricane in a story about Jersey before. Jersey Electricity said restoring power to some customers ""may take several days"" due to the number of overhead lines brought down by the storm. Jersey's library, youth service and Skills Jersey are to remain closed alongside the island's schools ""to allow services to clear roads and to assess school sites"". All Jersey Heritage sites, apart from La Houge Bie, will open to the public from Saturday. Liberty Bus said it hoped to run as many services as it could after all routes were suspended on Thursday. Work is continuing to restore services to about 600 islanders who were left without a landline telephone, as well as mobile phone users who were also affected.

A committee of MPs had raised concerns over a lack of health services helping those hit by such ""shock events"". But the government said on Friday that extra emergency funding to support crisis-hit farmers was not needed. Farmers say the floods have taken a huge toll on their mental health and they have received little support. Lincolnshire grower Henry Moreton currently has 155 acres (0.6 sq km) of land under water at his 500-acre (2 sq km) farm near Woodhall Spa. The 50-year-old sixth-generation farmer estimates he has lost between £55,000 and £65,000 worth of oil seed rape, winter wheat and barley to flooding after Storm Babet hit last week. The father-of-one told the BBC: ""I'm a very glass-half-full chap all the time. I'm always optimistic, my wife says, but when I went up our farm road towards the river on Saturday morning I got as far as the pond and I just stopped and cried because I didn't know what to do. What do you do? ""I've never had the wind taken out of my sails like it. ""My wife was that worried she hid the shotgun cabinet keys. She only told me that yesterday. She said she had never seen me look like that."" In May, the UK Parliament's Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) committee published a report into rural mental health. It found that extreme weather events and animal health crises - including mass culls to control diseases like bird flu - left farmers, their workers and their vets dealing with mental health trauma with little support. It called on the government to provide dedicated emergency funding to ""enable local areas to quickly access more resources to respond to rural communities' mental health needs during and, crucially, after crisis events"". But, in a response published on Friday, the government said it would not allocate specific funding and that current levels of support were sufficient. It said guidance on the impact of flooding on mental health was provided on its website and that it worked with charities and organisations, such as the National Flood Forum, to support people at risk of flooding. A Defra spokesperson said the government was ""acutely aware of the impacts flooding and climate events can have on farmers, including on their mental health"". It added that Environment Agency teams were ""working hard on the ground to help people recover from Storm Babet and the current impacts being felt by Storm Ciarán"". It said it was also providing support through its rural business support scheme, the future farming resilience fund, to link up farmers with mental health service providers. But Sir Robert Goodwill, the Efra committee chair, said he was ""disappointed"" by the government's ""rejection of measures to support the specific and identifiable mental health needs of those who live in rural areas"". ""This was an opportunity to make significant changes which could greatly impact our rural communities. With this response the government demonstrates a worrying degree of complacency,"" he added. Mr Moreton said that with long waits at his local GP's surgery, he had few options for mental health support in the immediate aftermath of the flooding. Instead, he has depended on family and friends, already helping him after his father - ""my best friend and my work mate since I was nine"" - died from cancer 18 months ago. ""When he died I knew what to do, I just kept going. But when something happens like this (flooding) it's out of your control. I never felt like I ran into a brick wall like that before and there's no-one out here to talk to, apart from friends,"" Mr Moreton said. He said he felt the government ""did not really care about farmers"" but acknowledged more needed to reach out for help, saying: ""Farmers are our own worst enemy. We never want to admit we are weak and we are very good at saying we are absolutely fine when we're not.""

Storm Babet and Storm Ciarán have left ground waterlogged and more rain has been forecast for the coming days. Some organisers said they would try to rearrange their events, but most said cancellation was the only option. Saturday's fireworks and night taxiway run at Lincolnshire Aviation Centre was among the cancelled events. Bosses at the centre, based in East Kirkby, said rainfall over the last two weeks had taken the car parks and grass landing strip to a condition which would not be safe to use. In a statement on the centre's website, they said: ""Customer safety is our main concern and the condition of the car parks means we could not ensure the safety of vehicles and customers entering and leaving the site."" Anyone with tickets would receive a refund, they added. Meanwhile, the Caistor and District Lions Club has cancelled its display and the event in Bourne will also not now go ahead. Both were due to be held on Saturday. Staff at Alford Cricket Club said they would no longer be able to operate the town's fireworks event safely on Saturday, however they said they hoped to rearrange it for another date. Spilsby Rotary club also cancelled its fireworks event which was due to take place on Sunday because of the waterlogged ground, a decision it said was ""not taken lightly"".

At least six people in Italy and one person in Albania were killed on Friday, bringing the storm’s death toll to 14 across Europe this week. Throughout the day, the storm brought more death and destruction as it moved eastward across the continent. In Albania, police said a motorist died when he lost control while driving a car, which slid and hit barriers. Many roads in the country were flooded, including in the capital, Tirana. Huge waves pummeled the Adriatic shores of the Balkans, and strong winds uprooted trees and ripped off roofs. Ferries connecting Croatia's islands with the coastline were halted. Italian Civil Protection authorities said that 200 millimeters (nearly eight inches) of rain fell in a three-hour period, from the coastal city of Livorno to the inland valley of Mugello, and caused riverbanks to overflow. Video showed at least a dozen cars getting swept away down a flooded road. Tuscany Gov. Eugenio Giani said that six people died in the storm, which dumped an amount of rainfall not recorded in the last 100 years. “There was a wave of water bombs without precedence,” Giani told Italian news channel Sky TG24. Climate scientists say human-induced climate change has led to heavier rainfall during storms like Ciarán, often resulting in more severe damage. “If the conditions are different than 20 years ago, it is obvious to everyone,'' Nello Musumeci, the government's minister for civil protection, told Sky TG24, noting that weather systems in Italy have become more tropical in nature. The dead in Tuscany included an 85-year-old man found in the flooded ground floor of his home near the city of Prato, north of Florence, and an 84-woman who died while trying to remove water from her home in the same area, according to Italian news agency ANSA. The other victims were a couple who had been missing near the town of Vinci and a person in Livorno province. Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera said Friday evening that the wife of the man whose body was found earlier in the town near Prato also perished. At least two people were missing Friday in Tuscany, along with an off-duty firefighter reported missing in the mountains of Veneto, north of Venice. Other regions were on high-alert and authorities warned that the storm was heading toward southern Italy. At least 48,000 utility customers were without electricity, Transport and Infrastructure Minister Matteo Salvini said. High-speed train service between Florence and Milan as well as along smaller rail lines in Tuscany were affected. Ciarán left at least seven people dead as it swept across Spain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany on Thursday. The storm devastated homes, caused travel mayhem and cut power to a vast number of people. As the storm pushed through, it flooded at least four hospitals, including in Pisa and Mugello. Throughout Tuscany, train lines and highways were disrupted and schools were closed. Hundreds of people were unable to get home, including about 150 stranded in Prato after a train line was suspended Thursday night. Around 40,000 people were without electricity on Friday. The mayor of Prato expressed shock at the force of the flood that devastated the city overnight. By early Friday, residents were working to clean the damage. “A blow to the stomach, a pain that brings tears. But even after an evening and night of devastation, we are pulling up our sleeves to clean and bring our city back to normality,’’ Mayor Matteo Biffoni posted on social media. Florence Mayor Dario Nardella told Sky TG24 that the Arno River, which runs through the center of the city, had reached the first level of alert, with the highest levels forecast for midday. Neither he nor the governor expected the river to overrun its banks. “The psychological fear is high, considering that tomorrow is the anniversary of the 1966 flood,” Nardella said, recalling a flood that killed 101 people and damaged or destroyed millions of artistic masterpieces and rare books. In Austria’s southern Carinthia province, which borders Italy and Slovenia, wind and heavy rain on Thursday night led to landslides, blocked roads and power cuts. About 1,600 households were without electricity early Friday, the Austria Press Agency reported. The storm receded in northern France and the Atlantic coast on Friday, but heavy rains continued in some regions as emergency workers cleared away debris from the day before. Meanwhile, Corsica in the Mediterranean faced unusually fierce winds Friday — up to 140 kph (87 mph) — and regions in the Pyrenees in the southwest were under flood warnings. More than a half-million French households remained without electricity for a second day, mainly in the western region of Brittany. Trains were halted in several areas and many roads remained closed. French President Emmanuel Macron traveled Friday to storm-ravaged areas of Brittany, and Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne was traveling to hard-hit areas of Normandy. ___ Geir Moulson in Berlin, Angela Charlton in Paris, Llazar Semini in Tirana, Albania, and Jovana Gec in Belgrade, Serbia, contributed to this report."

But Tata Motors is a must-buy now and on any decline.” Bhasin also says: “I would advise investors that if you have the option, take a look at Jindal Steel, JSW Steel. Steel is going to be the real killer in the next few months. We have these issues in Ukraine and now the Israel-Hamas conflict too. Sooner rather than later, commodities will pick up.” What a rebound from the Thursday panic lows. Forget the index, the Small Cap Index has rebounded almost 6.5% from Thursday's panic lows. I clearly remember you were the one calling out that this fall should be bought. We are going to have a cracker of a Diwali! I would not hold you on levels, but at least a good rebound has played out. Well put and we have just started. Look at the US markets. It is on a roll. Bond yields are down from 4.95% to 4.65% and looking good for more. The dollar is weak. China is rebounding. And why are we sulking? It is the index now. And like you rightly put it out, on any fall, REC, PFC, BHEL make new highs. So I am of the opinion that we are just passing time and consolidation is very healthy for the market. But the real action will start today. Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO Courses Offering College Course Website IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Executive Officer Programme Visit IIM Kozhikode IIMK Chief Product Officer Programme Visit IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Operations Officer Programme Visit I think we are headed to 19700-20000. Fingers crossed, maybe 20,000 by Diwali. The fall was more to do with a lot of factors accumulated. And now the rise will also come in sync with that. You cannot have midcaps make new highs and the index do nothing. The valuations are playing catch-up. Whether you look at banks, how long can HDFC Bank underperform? ICICI, Axis numbers have been far ahead of the Street. PSU banks have taken the market by storm. It is going to be metals, banks, and construction and autos which will drive the market higher. So cheers to a new sparkling Diwali which comes next week. I am very bullish on the market. Godrej Properties has been one of your stocks. I remember when it fell from what, if you could pull up the last one year or two year chart from peaking out around 2500. It fell to 900 or 1200 or thereabout. There was a lot of panic on the street. You had, I remember, started talking about it around 1200. Now it is 1700. Are you still bullish on this one? Yes, you are right. I have owned Godrej from Rs 350-400 in the last five years. And it is a personal thing, as a disclosure. I believed in management. I believed in the outlook. I believed in the pedigree. You can yourself see, you know, smell the coffee. At Rs 1100-1200, the second largest player in the country was available at the weakest valuation. And now you are just raring to go. DLF numbers, Godrej numbers, plus the effect of wealth is humongous. Close to where I stay is Camellias, DLF sold a 10,000 square feet house for almost Rs 100 crore. Maybe Rs 100 crore is an aberration, but still Rs 70-75 crore is the rate. So real estate is taking the market by storm in the sense, fixed assets are doing well. And it is always going to be pedigree players who will lead the pack because people have had enough of errant builders who have taken the money and not performed. Godrej has been an outperformer along with DLF and it is just to tell you they are hitting new highs at a time when the index is doing nothing which is telling you where these stocks can go if the index starts to go to new highs. What about Tata Motors? Numbers are overall in the good direction and margin guidance is towards the positive. But the second deal of the EV business which the market was expecting so far, probably a 20% premium to the previous one, has not happened. Are the positives priced in and or even at these levels, are you okay with Tata Motors? Well, they are three parts of the pie. One, the stock has run up fairly strongly from Rs 390-400 levels where we were very bullish. B) A large part of the earnings will get into the prices. C), Look at the business model of both Mahindra and Tata Motors. The EV market in Nexon is only gathering steam. China seems to be on a very strong comeback, which is why metals and autos, particularly will do very well there. The spread of other products which they have are actually expanding and that includes Europe and the other markets. Their global portfolio is good. Locally, we are in the sweetest spot. You have seen auto lenders, auto stockists and everyone ride their way along with the OEM chain. So Tata Motors is a must-have in a portfolio, whether you buy some now or lower. I am looking at a target closer to Rs 800 which can come before the budget. I also think Bajaj Auto, Hero Moto can be really the stars of 2024, given that they are coming on a low base. But Tata Motors is a must-buy now and on any decline. What is your take on Zomato? The stock will come out with its earnings. Anything that we should specifically watch out for? The real icing may have taken place in the Rs 50 to 100 run-up, but I still think it has got miles to go. As a disclosure, we own this stock in our portfolio, which has been a contrarian play and played out excellently. Paytm, Zomato and PB Fintech are here for the next many years. Like you pointed out, numbers will have to justify the valuation. It is not a cheap stock and earnings will take time to come. But you cannot track this stock or this fintech business on a monthly or a quarterly basis. You have to give them more time. As you are aware, their margin expansion and their reach is getting bigger. The eating habits or the QSR space is very attractive. As a disclosure, we have a buy on this stock. We own it. Paytm, PB Fintech and Devyani International are four of our top picks. Is the zing out, are best of the gains for the year in some of the railway stocks, is that over? Well, I was just seeing the presentation of Jindal Steel and the market was disappointed in numbers. I was also not aware the biggest supplier of head hardened rails is Jindal Steel in the country and they are talking of metros in Ahmedabad, Surat, Chennai, Indore, you name the city. And they are saying their order book is the strongest ever in the history of the company. So I think that railway stocks, metro stocks, these ancillaries have miles to go. Yes, they have run up a lot, but I am extremely bullish. I would advise investors that if you have the option, take a look at this Jindal Steel, JSW Steel. Sooner rather than later, commodities will pick up. China is on a rare comeback. But in India, the consumption, particularly railway and defence, will mean that conduit players, which are input costs, will do very well. The presentation of Jindal Steel and JSW will amaze you. I am extremely bullish on certain names in the railways. And I think that there is still much more upside. IRFC is one of the preferred picks. The numbers are very strong, it has no debt and it actually gets yields at the highest and its cost of money may be the lowest in the PSU pack. Did you manage to catch the results of Kiloskar Oil Engines? This is the second or third result they have posted after that analyst meeting. The first one they had in 10 years and numbers appear to be falling in place. No, I have not had a look but we have had a coverage on this stock much lower. The stock has been zooming and that is more to do with the Kiloskar Group's re-rating on a lot of sectors, particularly the brand ownership of Toyota which they have here on the franchise. Kiloskar is an under-owned group, Kiloskar Pneumatic is one stock we own, I have not had a look at Kiloskar Oil. Connect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy "

In this case, Ciarán is a tribute toCiarán Fearon, a Northern Irish civil servant working in flood monitoring.Storm Ciarán prompted amber and yellow weather warnings from the UK Met office and red weather warnings from Metéo France. High winds have disrupted travel, blocked roads and drains with debris and damaged overhead lines, leaving over a million people without electricity in both countries.Given how early Ciarán arrived in the winter storm season, trees are still in leaf and anchored in soil that is waterlogged from recent wet weather, putting many trees at risk of being uprooted.Flood warningswere issued across the south of the UK and some parts of the east coast as heavy rain has met with sodden ground and already swollen rivers.Storm Ciarán is anextra-tropical cyclone(in other words, a rotating storm which forms outside the tropics) and unusual among North Atlantic storms, which rarely produce both heavy rain and high winds over large areas.Low pressure in the eye of the cyclone deepened rapidly as it moved over the UK, dropping by more than 24 millibarsin 24 hoursto a near-record low of 953 millibars. This is what meteorologists call a bomb cyclone.Forming a sting jetOnly two events with similarly low pressure havebeen recordedthis far south in the UK. Satellite images taken the day before the storm hit suggested asting jet(a stream of air that can form within a storm and produce extremely intense winds over a very small area) was forming that could strike the north of France.Ciarán is the UK's third named storm in a winter storm season that is shaping up to be exceptionally turbulent. The first named storm was in September (Agnes), which is very early. And the UK also had a named storm in August 2023 (Antoni), which is highly unusual.Large parts of the UK saw twice the average amount of rainfall inOctobertoo, largely due to Storm Babet that flooded parts of the north of England and Scotland and left around100,000 people without electricity. In the lead up to Storm Ciarán, severe flood damage was reported inNewryin Northern Ireland andWexfordin Ireland.Why autumn 2023 has been so stormyThe succession of storms since August 2023 has been driven by an unusually strongjet streamthat has shifted further south than is typical for this time of year.The jet stream is a band of very strong wind high in the atmosphere that can extend across the Atlantic and bring storms to the UK. A stronger jet stream can make storms more powerful, and a more southerly position means that storms are warmer and carry more moisture and energy, making rapid intensification more likely.Similar conditions were present for Storm Babet, though Babet became cut off from the jet stream instead, causing it to stall over the UK. Such slow-moving storms can produce more persistent rainfall over one region and cause flooding and are predicted tobecome more commonin awarmer climate.The strength and position of the jet stream is related to the temperature difference between cold polar air and warmer sub-tropical air. The jet stream is stronger when this south-to-north temperature difference is greater.The boundary between polar and tropical air masses is further south than normal for this time of year due to anomalously warm sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic, coupled with anomalously cold conditions in the southeastern US. This has fueled successive storms over northern Europe.The unusual strength and position of the jet stream is probably a result of the positive phase of theEl Niño southern oscillation, a natural cycle in Earth's climate which brings higher sea surface temperatures to the western Pacific. El Niño also contributed to the UK's extremely wet and windy2013/14 winter seasonand oftencausesextremely low temperatures over North America and windy and wet conditions in Europe.More wet and windy conditions ahead?Winter storms that hit northern Europe will unleash heavier rainfall in future due to climate change, as warmer air holds more moisture. Scientists are less certain about how wind will differ in future storms, as the relevant processes, such as those causing changes in the jet stream, are more complicated.However,researchsuggests that storms which combinehigh windsand extreme rainfall, like Ciarán, will happen more often over northern Europe in future. This willcompound the risksof climate change as the effects of flooding and wind damage accumulate.Recent storms show that society has not adapted to worsening climate conditions. Reducinggreenhouse gas emissionswill mitigate risks from extreme weather. But national emission pledgescommit the world to more warmingand with it, more intense flooding and storm damage.Alongside drastically cutting emissions, countries must build more resilient infrastructure to adapt to a more turbulent climate. This will be costly, but far less costly than doing nothing."

A bridge collapsed near the city of Pistoia, killing two people. Another person died in the town of Rosignano. ""Over 200 millimetres of rain have fallen in three hours,"" Luigi D'Angelo, who is leading the Civil Protection rescue efforts, told Sky TG24 television. The governor of Tuscany said there were challenging issues around two large rivers in the area, the Bisenzio, north of Florence, and the Ombrone, in the southern part of the region. ""The situation is problematic, the Arno river is expected to reach a peak around midday in Florence, but there are no particular worries about this if it stops raining,"" Governor Eugenio Giani said in an interview with RAI's Radio Anch'io. Patients from three separate hospitals had to be moved to other facilities and many buildings were seriously damaged, Giani added. The defence ministry was supporting rescue efforts sending helicopters, trucks and water pumps to the flood-hit areas, Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said in a statement. Italy's Civil Protection agency on Thursday issued a warning of heavy rains and strong winds in central and southern Italy, with a high alert ""red code"" for Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia in the north of the country, and a medium alert ""orange code"" for nine other regions. Another person went missing in the Veneto region, the local governor was quoted as saying by Sky TG24. Storm Ciaran, which follows on the heels of Storm Babet two weeks ago, was driven by a powerful jet stream that swept in from the Atlantic, unleashing heavy rain and furious winds that have already caused heavy flooding in Northern Ireland, parts of Britain, Belgium and France."

Climate change threatens to reverse decades of progress towards better health and well-being, particularly in the most vulnerable communities. Scientific know-how and resources can help redress the balance, but are not sufficiently accessible or utilized, according to a new multi-agency report coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). WMO's annual State of Climate Services report this year focuses on health. It highlights the need for tailored climate information and services to support the health sector in the face of more extreme weather and poor air quality, shifting infectious disease patterns and food and water insecurity. ""Practically the whole planet has experienced heatwaves this year. The onset of El Nino in 2023 will greatly increase the likelihood of breaking temperature records further, triggering more extreme heat in many parts of the world and in the ocean - and making the challenge even greater,"" says WMO Secretary-General, Prof Petteri Taalas . ""It is clear that by channelling investment and boosting collaboration, there is huge potential to go further and faster by enhancing the impact of climate science and services so that health partners get the support they need at a time when unprecedented changes to our climate are having an increasing impact,"" add Prof. Taalas. The report, which includes input from more than 30 collaborating partners, features case studies from around the world showcasing how integrated climate and health action makes a very real difference in people's daily life. This includes early warning systems for extreme heat, pollen monitoring to help allergy sufferers and satellite surveillance for climate-sensitive diseases. ""The climate crisis is a health crisis, driving more severe and unpredictable weather events, fuelling disease outbreaks, and contributing to higher rates of noncommunicable diseases,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. ""By working together to make high-quality climate services more accessible to the health sector, we can help to protect the health and well-being of people facing the perils of climate change."" Nearly three quarters of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) provide climate data to the health sector, but the uptake is limited. Less than one quarter of Ministries of Health have a health surveillance system that utilizes meteorological information to monitor climate-sensitive health risks. Early Warnings for All The number of medium- or large-scale disaster events is projected to reach 560 a year - or 1.5 each day - by 2030. Countries with limited early warning coverage have disaster mortality that is eight times higher than countries with substantial to comprehensive coverage, according to figures cited in the report. A special section is devoted to extreme heat, which causes the greatest mortality of all extreme weather. However the impacts are underestimated as heat-related mortality could be 30 times higher than what is currently recorded. Heat warning services are provided to health decision makers in only half of the affected countries, but are expected to rapidly increase by 2027 under the international Early Warnings for All initiative. Between 2000 and 2019, estimated deaths due to heat were approximately 489,000 per year, with a particularly high burden in Asia (45%) and Europe (36%). Extreme heat conditions during the summer of 2022, were estimated to have claimed over 60,000 excess deaths in 35 European countries. Heatwaves also exacerbate air pollution, which is already responsible for an estimated 7 million premature deaths every year and is the fourth biggest killer by health risk factor. Climate change is exacerbating risks of food insecurity. In 2012-2021, 29 per cent more global land area was affected by extreme drought for at least one month per year than in 1951-1960. The compounding impacts of droughts and heatwave days were associated with 98 million additional people reporting moderate to severe food insecurity in 2020 than annually in 1981-2010, in 103 countries analysed, according to figures cited in the report. The changing climatic conditions are also enhancing the transmission of many climatically sensitive infectious vector-, food-, and water-borne diseases. For example, dengue is the world's fastest-spreading vector-borne disease, whilst the length of the malaria transmission season has increased in parts of the world. Some of the most significant challenges to health are in the nexus of water, food security and nutrition, the nexus of infectious diseases (food-, water-, airborne and vector-borne diseases), and the nexus of extreme weather and air quality, particularly in urban areas, says the report. Key messages: Climate change undermines health determinants and increases pressures on health systems threatening to reverse decades of progress to promote human health and well-being, particularly in the most vulnerable communities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes, with very high confidence, that future health risks from injury, disease, and death will increase due to more intense and frequent temperature extremes, cyclones, storms, floods, droughts, and wildfires. It is anticipated that over 50 per cent of the excess mortality resulting from climate change by the year 2050 will occur in Africa. Health protection is a priority in almost all countries and requires high-quality information to better inform decision-making. Climate information and services are fundamental for better understanding how and when health systems and population health can be impacted by climate extremes and a changing climate, and for managing climate-related risks. Climate information and services are fundamental for better understanding how and when health systems and population health can be impacted by climate extremes and a changing climate, and for managing risks. Tailored climate products and services can enhance the evidence and information available to health partners to detect, monitor, predict, and manage climate-related health risks. There is huge potential for enhancing the benefits of climate science and climate services for the health sector and for increasing accessibility, relevance and uptake. Only 31 per cent of NMHSs provide climate services at a 'full' or 'advanced' level of capacity. A large range of academic, private sector, and government partners are also working to fill the gap, and this needs to be put on a sustainable and coordinated footing. Extreme heat causes the greatest mortality of all extreme weather, yet heat warning services are provided to health decision makers in only half of the affected countries. According to the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change, rising temperatures and the growing over-65 population have triggered an increase in heat-related mortality in this age group of approximately 68 per cent between 2017-2021, compared to 2000-2004. According to the IPCC, there is ""high confidence"" that Central and South America, southern Europe, southern and Southeast Asia and Africa will be the most affected by climate change in terms of heat-related mortality by 2100, based on 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C increases in the global temperature. The IPCC also notes with ""very high confidence"" significant impacts of heat are expected from the combination of future urban development and the more frequent occurrence of heatwaves, with more hot days and warm nights adding to heat stress in cities. Concerns relating to air quality, climate change, and health are interlinked. Climate mitigation action leading to reducing air pollution can save lives. Despite this, only 2 per cent of climate finance commitments made by international development funders in developing and emerging countries is explicitly aimed at tackling air pollution (in 2015-2021), even though it is the most dangerous environmental threat to health. In 2019, air pollution moved up from the fifth to the fourth place in the scale of leading risk factors for death globally, continuing to exceed the impacts of other widely recognized risk factors for chronic disease like obesity, cardiovascular disease, and malnutrition. There is insufficient investment to improve the capabilities of the health sector, leaving it ill-prepared to safeguard the most vulnerable. Currently, just 0.2 per cent of total bilateral and multilateral adaptation finance supports projects that identify health as the primary focus, and the investment in the capacity for multisectoral and effective climate science and services is miniscule."" Most hydrometeorological investments are not clearly designed to support health outcomes. This needs to change. To fully harness the potential of climate services for health, transformational change in institutional development and integration across the health and climate sectors are needed. In the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic, all countries have experienced the social and economic losses and damages which can occur when the health of society is compromised. More must be done to prepare the health community for future shocks and pressures they may experience due to climate variability and the damaging effects of climate change. The governing World Meteorological Congress in 2023 approved a 10-year strategy on Advancing Integrated Climate, Environment, and Health Science and Services (2023-2033) in collaboration with WHO and other health partners to address the challenges.

At least six people have been killed in central Tuscany when Storm Ciaran swept through Italy after causing chaos in more western parts of Europe. Tuscany Governor Eugenio Giani said that six people died as torrential rain fell from the coastal city of Livorno to the inland valley of Mugello on Friday and rivers burst their banks flooding towns and villages. The dead included two elderly people from the city of Prato, north of Florence, according to Italian news agency ANSA. One person was also killed in Albania after they lost control of the car they were driving, bringing the storm’s death toll across the continent to 14. Italian Civil Protection authorities said that 200 millimetres (nearly eight inches) of rain fell in three hours on Friday. Giani said it was the heaviest amount of rain recorded in the last 100 years. “There was a wave of water bombs without precedence,” Giani told Italian news channel Sky TG24. Climate scientists say human-induced climate change has led to heavier rainfall during storms like Ciaran, often resulting in more severe damage. “If the conditions are different than 20 years ago, it is obvious to everyone,” Nello Musumeci, the government’s minister for civil protection, told Sky TG24, noting that weather systems in Italy have become more tropical in nature. At one point there were concerns the River Arno could flood the historic city of Florence, but the high water point passed without major incident. About 190 people were forced to evacuate their homes, including 150 in Campi Bisenzio, where houses were inundated and parked cars half-submerged in the water. Resident Enza Carfagna told the Reuters news agency how her family rescued an elderly wheelchair-bound ground-floor neighbour, using a blanket to lift her up the stairs. “Last night, it didn’t seem like a big thing, there was very little rain. Then at about 9pm (20:00 GMT), we saw all this brown water coming and we went to get the lady,” she said. High-speed train services between Florence and Milan were suspended and with an estimated 48,000 people left without power, the Italian government declared a state of emergency. It allocated an initial 5 million euros ($5.4m) to help the worst-hit areas. Huge waves also pummelled the Adriatic shores of the Balkans, as strong winds uprooted trees and ripped off roofs. Ferry services connecting Croatia’s islands were suspended because of the weather. Storm Ciaran was driven by a powerful jet stream that swept in from the Atlantic, unleashing heavy rain and furious winds that have already caused heavy flooding in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. More than half a million French homes remained without electricity for a second day, mainly in the northwestern region of Brittany. Trains were halted in several areas and many roads remained closed. French President Emmanuel Macron visited storm-ravaged areas of Brittany on Friday while Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne went to hard-hit areas of Normandy. Follow Al Jazeera English:"

The Met Office has extended a yellow warning for rain after Storm Ciarán brought flooding and damage. The Environment Agency (EA) said rivers would rise ""really quickly"" as the ground was already saturated by rain. It urged people to sign up to the EA's flood warning service and check their area. The Met Office warned: ""Flooding of a few homes and businesses is possible. ""Large waves may lead to dangerous conditions across some English Channel coastlines."" Clarissa Newell, from the Environment Agency in the South West, said: ""When the catchments are full of water like this it's really important to know that it will rise very quickly. ""You can think you're having a bit of rain then suddenly it's coming in through your door."" In this situation, she warned people turning off electricity and gas, and moving to safety, and ""bringing important documents with you"", was key. Bee Tucker, BBCSW broadcast meteorologist, said: ""Some places have had close to 50mm (2ins) of rain since the start of the month, almost a third of the average rainfall for November. ""Some of the heaviest showers could give 20mm (0.8in) of rain and some places could get all their monthly average rainfall by the end of play on Sunday."" Across the British Isles, the clean-up after Storm Ciarán continued on Saturday, after roofs were blown off homes and some train lines completely ground to a halt. In Hampshire, families in more than 18,000 homes headed into the weekend without water or experiencing low pressure after the storm led to a supply works being shut down. National Grid said on Saturday morning that all storm-related power cuts in Devon and Cornwall had been resolved, while Energy Networks Association (ENA) said nationally there were no outstanding outages. Most railway services had also resumed on Saturday but the GWR line between Liskeard and Looe is expected to remain closed throughout the day, the operator said, as a result of ""heavy rain and winds over the last 24 hours"". A bus replacement is operating and tickets for travel on Saturday can be used on Sunday. Meanwhile, Cornwall Council said work on the clean-up after Storm Ciarán would continue into the weekend, after its highway team responded to more than 400 incidents, with all fallen trees now cleared. Pondhu Primary School in St Austell, Cornwall, remained shut on Friday due to extensive flooding, with the school saying it needed time to ""dry and clean the building so the children can return safely"". Councillor Martyn Alvey, who responsible for the environment at Cornwall Council, said: ""Our next concern is surface water flooding that is possible as a result of the rain on saturated ground. ""I would say that every community that knows they have a vulnerability to flooding should be on alert. ""We are not going to have the same issue we had last weekend with spring tides locking in those coastal villages but some of them will still have trouble from the river that feeds through the village and into the sea. ""We are ready to respond as required.

[+] in February 1995 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Ron Eisenberg/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images) I often reflect on my elementary school days in Canton, Georgia. On any given morning, I was mostly concerned about what was on the lunch menu or what games we would play outside at recess. The last thing on my mind was whether my school was in an air pollution “dirty spot.” However, new research using NASA satellite data suggests that your child’s school location may determine how much exposure they have to air pollution and unsurprisingly, certain groups are disproportionately exposed to the “bad air.” For years, I have conducted research on extreme weather-climate disparities and how communities of color, the elderly, children, and people living below the poverty line are most vulnerable to them. In cities, communities of color are disproportionately concentrated in the “hottest” part of the urban heat island. During hurricanes like Harvey (2017) and Katrina (2005) these same communities took a bigger punch than more resilient or affluent communities. Ongoing work by my colleague Catherine Coleman Flowers and her Center for Rural Enterprise and Environmental Justice (CREEJ) consistently reveals disparities in exposure to septic system failures related to extreme rainfall. Now, a new study led by Michael Cheeseman of Colorado State University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration finds a very familiar story related to air pollution. In an essay written by Adam Voiland and featured on the NASA Earth Observatory website, Cheeseman said, “When you look at NASA satellite data across the United States and compare that to socioeconomic data about our schools, the picture is clear: Hispanic, Asian, and Black and African American public school children attend schools with higher concentrations of air pollution than white students, especially in urban areas.” There also seem to be strong correlations for poor communities, irrespective of race. The study was recently published in the journal GeoHealth, and is comprehensive assessment of over 98,000 public schools. Hispanic Public School students and Nitrogen Oxide Concentrations. Data is from the Ozone Monitoring ... [+] Instrument aboard NASA's Aura satellite As an example, the maps above show Hispanic public school students and Nitrogen Oxide Concentrations measured by the the Ozone Monitoring Instrument aboard NASA's Aura satellite. According to the EPA website, “Breathing air with a high concentration of NO2 can irritate airways in the human respiratory system....exposures over short periods can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, leading to respiratory symptoms (such as coughing, wheezing or difficulty breathing), hospital admissions and visits to emergency rooms.” Longer exposure can lead to asthma and other serious health outcomes. Cheeseman said that he was surprised to find such large air pollution differences as a function of race and ethnic groups. For many of us that have done scholarship on environmental or climate justice, it is unfortunately not surprising at all. Robert Bullard, a pioneering authority on environmental justice, has repeatedly warned, “Today, zip code is still the most potent predictor of an individual’s health and well-being. Individuals who physically live on the ‘wrong side of the tracks’ are subjected to elevated environmental health threats and more than their fair share of preventable diseases.” The NASA Earth Observatory essay affirms Bullard’s point. Adam Voiland writes, “Hispanic, Asian, and Black and African American students are often located in dense urban areas that are frequently exposed to large amounts of vehicle traffic, factories, and other sources of nitrogen dioxide.” Suburban students, which tend to have larger White populations, are exposed to “cleaner” air. There were exceptions, however. Voiland notes, “Many Indigenous students attend school in rural areas with few pollution sources and low concentrations of NO2....significant numbers of Black and African American students attend school in rural communities in the Southeast with low concentrations of air pollution.” This study was enabled by NASA’s Health and Air Quality Applied Sciences Team (HAQAST). Shobhana Gupta is the associate manager of NASA’s Earth Action Equity & Environmental Justice program and a trained physicion. She told Voiland, “Children have higher respiratory rates and their lungs are still developing, so they are more susceptible to air pollutants.” Such health outcomes can have cascading impacts within communities. Ok, I know some of you will roll your eyes and say that all people in these pollution hotspots are at risk. I would respond, “Absolutely, there is concern and a need to address this challenge for everyone.” Here’s why the issue is particulary acute for certain communities. Vulnerability is determined by exposure to a hazard, sensitivity to it, and adaptive capacity (the ability to bounce back from it). I have the socio-economic means to relocate if my families is “exposed” to degraded air quality. I also have adequate health insurance, which increases my adaptive capacity and lowers my sensitivity to the hazard. Many of the communities identified in this study may not have the means to be as resilient to bad air quality, heat, or a hurricane. I recently saw my favorite group, Depeche Mode, in concert. One of their signature hits says, “Try walking in my shoes, you’d stumble in my footsteps.” Before reacting to what I have written, try to move outside of your perspective and walk in the shoes of the families that have a different reality.

New York 3 November 2023 The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General. **Gaza The Secretary-General and Special Coordinator Tor Wennesland are continuing their constant contact with leaders across the region, focusing on ways to end suffering and prevent further dangerous escalation. In the last few days, Mr. Wennesland met with President [Isaac] Herzog, senior Ministry of Defense and Israel Defense officials, as well as with United States and European Union envoys, among others. Back here this morning, the Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, briefed Member States on the humanitarian situation in Gaza. He talked about the despair he saw as he spoke to families of Israeli hostages and families in Gaza who have lost loved ones and their homes. Mr. Griffiths said what we have seen unfold in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory over the last 26 days is nothing short of a blight on our collective conscience. He said there are intense humanitarian negotiations — involving Israel, Egypt, the United States and the UN — with more than 300 trucks having moved into Gaza as of yesterday. More than 100 trucks moved into Gaza yesterday alone, he added; yet, that remains far less than the 500 truckloads of goods that moved into Gaza every day prior to the current crisis. Griffiths called once more for the immediate release of all hostages and stressed the need to keep civilian infrastructure safe from harm, and he reiterated our call for humanitarian pauses. Lynn Hastings, the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory also briefed via videoconference. She said the humanitarian impact of the attacks in Gaza has been catastrophic with more than 9,000 people have been killed in Gaza, and that's according to the Ministry of Health there. Thomas White of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) briefed from Rafah and he discussed the worsening situation as fuel is running out, noting that we could soon have a situation where raw sewage gushes out onto Gaza's streets. He paid tribute to the work that UNRWA staff are doing in very dangerous conditions. And sadly, just to recall, 72 staff from UNRWA have been killed so far, to date. **Occupied Palestinian Territory Still on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says we along with our partners will release a Flash Appeal update on Monday, covering the remainder of the year. The $1.2 billion appeal aims to support 2.7 million people — the entire Gaza population and half a million people in the West Bank. The original appeal, that was launched on 12 October, asked for $294 million to support nearly 1.3 million people. The situation has grown increasingly desperate since then. The revised Flash Appeal will outline the need for food, water, health care, shelter, hygiene and other urgent priorities following the massive bombardments in Gaza. **Mali Update on another crisis we are following closely, which is United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). The convoy, we've been updating you, which is travelling from Kidal city to Gao, again suffered an attack. This is part of the withdrawal process. Earlier today, the convoy hit another improvised explosive device (IED) about 3 kilometres north-east of Anéfis village in the Kidal region. Seven peacekeepers have been injured and are being medically evacuated. On Wednesday, you will recall, eight other peacekeepers were injured in a similar incident. They are now reported to be in a stable condition. This is the fourth time that the convoy has been impacted by an IED since it left the base in Kidal on 31 October. **Sudan And a quick update for you from Sudan, which is, as you know, another major humanitarian crisis. An update on our efforts to deliver life-saving assistance. Our colleagues at OCHA say they facilitated an eight-truck convoy of food and medical supplies to South Kordofan's capital Kadugli — the first since intense fighting broke out in April. This is a positive development, but we of course need sustained access to continue delivering to people in need across the country. However, the situation remains extremely distressing, specifically in Darfur, and especially for women and girls. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) says they're deeply alarmed by reports they received of women and girls are being abducted and held in inhuman, degrading and slave-like conditions in areas controlled by the Rapid Support Forces in Darfur, where they are allegedly forcibly married and held for ransom. Credible information from survivors, witnesses and other sources suggests that more than 20 women and girls have been taken, but the number could be higher. The UN Human Rights Office restated the High Commissioner's calls on senior officials of both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces — as well as any other armed groups affiliated with them — to unequivocally condemn these vile acts and issue — urgently — clear instructions to their subordinates demanding zero tolerance for sexual violence. They must also ensure the abducted women and girls are promptly released, and provided with the necessary support, including medical and psychosocial care, and that all alleged cases are fully and promptly investigated, with those found responsible held accountable and brought to justice. **Democratic Republic of the Congo Turning to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, our humanitarian colleagues tell us that, in October alone, last month, more than 300,000 people were driven from their homes by escalating violence in North Kivu Province in the eastern part of the Congo. This brings the total number of people displaced in the eastern parts of the country to more than 6 million people. The eastern provinces are also facing continued outbreaks of cholera and measles. Despite the volatile situation, we, along with our partners, have reached some 3 million people with humanitarian aid, including 1.9 million with food assistance, in the region. However, as we have said on several occasions, access remains very much of a challenge through the recent and ongoing violence in Beni. This has forced many humanitarian workers to temporarily suspend their operations, leaving more than 140,000 people unable to receive assistance. This year's $2.3 billion Humanitarian Response Plan is only 36 per cent funded. We need more money. **Ukraine Turning to Ukraine, I can tell you that we strongly condemn the latest wave of Russian attacks against critical infrastructure in various parts of the country, which reportedly resulted in injuries among the civilian population, including children, and caused damage to civilian residential and commercial buildings. We are concerned about the escalation of such incidents and their impact on the lives of civilians, especially at the onset of the winter period. We reiterate in the clearest terms that attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law and they must stop immediately. Also, just a humanitarian update from Ukraine, our colleagues there tell us that the attacks this week have destroyed energy facilities, schools, hospitals and other public sites. The Kherson region in the south and the Donetsk region in the east were particularly affected. Kharkiv City was also attacked last night. Our partner non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are already on-site, providing psychological support and shelter materials to people whose homes were damaged in the attacks. We and our partners continue to provide critical aid to front-line communities. Today, an inter-agency humanitarian convoy delivered vital aid to about 1,600 people who remain on the front-line town of Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia Region. The aid includes medicine, household and hygiene kits, as well as blankets, mattresses, solar lamps, sleeping bags and food aid has also continued to be distributed. This year alone, we and our partners have delivered 14 convoys to front-line communities in the Zaporizhzhia Region, providing essential support to more than 30,000 people living near the southern front. There have been 96 humanitarian convoys to front-line areas since the beginning of the year. Ahead of winter, humanitarian workers are distributing vital items, such as thermal blankets, mattresses and portable heaters. We and our partners are also appealing for some $435 million to deliver winter assistance to more than 1.7 million people across Ukraine through March of 2024 — obviously covers the winter. **Deputy Secretary-General A couple of travel announcements for you. Tomorrow, our Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, will be heading to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where she will participate in the Opening Ceremony of the inaugural International Conference on Women in Islam. This is organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Jeddah. The Conference aims to facilitate dialogue about the position of Women in Islam, encompassing both religious and cultural aspects and promoting Muslim women's rights. During her visit, she will meet with senior government officials, the Islamic Development Bank, and other stakeholders. She will be back in New York on Tuesday, 7 November 2023. **Cyprus Jean-Pierre Lacroix, our Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, is wrapping up his three-day visit to Cyprus today. Lacroix had discussions with the leaders of both sides on the island regarding recent developments within the buffer zone and the work of the UN Peacekeeping Force to maintain peace and stability on the island. He also engaged with civil society representatives, including women and youth representatives. He also went to the Pyla/Pile plateau and stressed that the implementation of the understanding that was reached recently is essential. In addition, he visited the Committee on Missing Persons and met with some of its members. **Mozambique Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Joyce Msuya, is in Mozambique, where she visited the northern province of Cabo Delgado yesterday and today. We and our partners continue to provide life-saving assistance to people impacted by the conflict there. Ms. Msuya met with women, children and men who have returned to the district of Mocimboa da Praia, after fleeing violence that started in 2017. Nearly three quarters of the more than 175,000 returnees in the district reside in areas where basic infrastructure — such as schools, health centres and water facilities — have yet to be restored. A reminder that more than 2 million people in Mozambique need humanitarian assistance to cope with the impact of the conflict, climate change and extreme weather events, including Cyclone Freddy earlier this year. We and our partners have reached now some 1.5 million people in the country with some form of humanitarian assistance during the first part of this year. To do more, we need more funding. In 2023, the Humanitarian Appeal for Mozambique for $513 million is just over one-third funded. Our response plan for Cyclone Freddy, floods and cholera is even less resourced, having received just 16 per cent of the $138 million that we need. **Food Price Index Food Price Index: Our friends at Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report today that the international food commodity prices declined moderately in October, down by 0.5 per cent from September, with the index for dairy products the only one to see a bit of rise. And according to the latest Crop Prospects and Food Situation report also published today, FAO says persisting and intensifying conflicts are aggravating food insecurity, and moderating international food commodity prices are being countered by weak currencies in many low-income countries. **Tsunami Awareness Day Sunday is which day, besides being Sunday? It is the marathon. I will not be running, I hate to tell you. It is World Tsunami Awareness Day. In hismessage, the Secretary-General says that our ""Early Warnings for All"" initiative — which aims to protect every person on Earth by 2027 — prioritizes the needs of the most vulnerable. It requires an investment of $3.1 billion — around 50 cents for each person to be covered — which is a small price to pay to protect people. **Noon Briefing Guest Monday we will be joined virtually from Paris by guest, Guilherme Canela De Souza Godoi, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) Head of the Freedom of Expression and Safety of Journalists Section. **Afghanistan And just want to flag to you also on Sunday, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) — in coordination with the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) — will launch its 2023 Afghanistan opium survey, always an interesting document. The survey examines the latest findings and emerging trends on the illicit opium trade and economy. It will be the second report since thede factoauthorities banned cultivation of opium poppy and all narcotics in April last year. The 2022 harvest was largely exempted from the decree, meaning this survey is the first that examines trends since the enforcement of the ban. I think the advance copy has been shared with you. **Questions and Answers Spokesman: Maggie, then Edie. Correspondent: A lot of bad news for a Friday, Steph. Spokesman: Yeah. Question: A lot. And there's more. After meeting with Secretary of State [Antony] Blinken, Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu said there would be no humanitarian pauses until the hostages are released. How is this going to impact the UN's work? Spokesman: Well, we will continue... we've seen the statements. We will obviously continue to push for humanitarian goods to get in. I mean, I don't... we couldn't be any clearer as to what the humanitarian situation in Gaza is and the need for more aid to come in. Edie? Correspondent: This time, Maggie beat me to the exact same question. Question: But also, can you tell us what the Secretary-General is going to do now? Is he planning any future travels? Who's he been talking to? Spokesman: Oh, the travels will, I mean, I've... no, let me put it this way. I have no travel to announce in the immediate. I think he will be here next week. We also have his annual meeting of the Chief Executive Board, which will happen next week, which will be formally announced a little later, which will be an occasion for him also to have very focused discussion, not only on the years ahead, but on the situation, especially the humanitarian situation now. And he remains... I'm not going to go into the details of his calls, but he remains in contact with a number of people. Question: Is the Chief Executives Board meeting going to be here in New York? Spokesman: It will be in New York. Yeah. The fall sessions are always here in New York. Dezhi? Correspondent: They asked some parts of my question, actually. Okay. Spokesman: Don't complain to me about who's asking the question. Question: Yeah. Everybody's talking about the humanitarian pauses. But as far as I remember, the Secretary-General is actually asking for humanitarian ceasefire, which is, to some degree, is actually different from the humanitarian pauses, which led to the hostages. So what does the Secretary-General's idea on this pauses for releasing the hostages? Do you think that would contribute to a humanitarian ceasefire? Spokesman: No. First of all, I think the Secretary-General has been very clear is that all the things he's been talking about, which is, you know, a halt in the fighting to get humanitarian aid, the release of hostages immediately and unconditionally, should not be linked and they should not be used as bargaining chips. Question: So since we have already talked about hostages, is there any update on the negotiations of releasing the hostages? Spokesman: Nothing to share with you. Question: What about the situation in the border area between Lebanon and Israel? Do you have any...? Spokesman: I mean, we're just... there have been exchanges of fire across the Blue Line. Today, we will reiterate our message to avoid any sort of further escalation in what is already a very tense area. Amelie, then Sylviane. Question: Thanks, Steph. On Mali, it's been, I mean, the convoy has been hit almost every day by an IED. So what is MINUSMA, I mean, do they believe that the convoy is specifically targeted on its way to Gao? Or it is just that the road is...? Spokesman: It's hard, I mean, let me put it this way. I think it's hard to tell, right? I don't... I've not seen any reports where they have seen people leave IEDs, whether or not these are IEDs that have been there for a long time, whether people know that the convoy is coming this way. Because, frankly, there aren't a thousand ways to get from Kidal to Gao when you're dealing with that many trucks. So it's clear what road they will use. We can only speak to the impact that it's having, which is a continuous threat to our peacekeeping colleagues. Question: Just a follow-up. Considering some previous convoys were driving really, really slow, like, 1 or 2 kilometres an hour, how many more days will they take for them to reach Gao, and so how many more days are going to be at risk of being... Spokesman: I think my sense is it was about four days' worth of travel. So hopefully, they will arrive sometime this weekend. And it's clear that every time there's such an attack, it delays the convoy further. Sylviane, Dawn, and then Caitlin. Question: Thank you, Stephane. And on south of Lebanon, the UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) is caught now in the heart of the tension between Lebanon and Israel. Is there any plan for the Secretary-General or for Mr. Lacroix to go to Lebanon and visit UNIFIL? Spokesman: I will... if I have any travel to announce, I don't think there's any plan from the Secretary-General in the immediate term. For Mr. Lacroix, I will keep you... we will keep you posted. Question: There is another. The 1701 will be... the new report will be discussed on 22 November. Is there a new... can we have some more information about the UNIFIL engagement? Spokesman: Well, I mean, we will... Question: Are there new engagement rules during this war? Spokesman: New engagement rules? Correspondent: Yeah. To take place. There's no new rules of engagement as far as I know. Correspondent: Okay. Spokesman: Dawn, then Caitlin, and then I'll get to the rest. I have two questions, one on Syria and one on Gaza. For Syria, there was a suicide drone attack in Homs on 5 October. But since then, the Syrian regime hasn't let up on its attacks in north-west Syria. While I can't speak for Syrians, when I go on social media, a lot of Syrians that I follow say that they feel forgotten by the world. So I wanted to know what would be the Secretary-General's message to the people in north-west Syria who are still suffering. And then my second question is, has to do with the Secretary-General's level of confidence in the crop of world leaders that we have today and their ability to deal with the situations that we have in Gaza and Ukraine. Does he believe that these people and, I mean, you could think about, like, the P5 of this Security Council, are they up to the task? Do they have what it takes to deal with what's happening in the world today? Thanks. Spokesman: Listen, no, no, that's not... it's not the answer. The answer is that they have no choice. We have no choice. We all have to be up to the task. You know, while there may be not as much political progress as we would like on the Syria track as outlined in what is called for by the Security Council resolution. The United Nations, embodied by the humanitarian staff that remains in Syria, has not forgotten the Syrian people, has not abandoned the Syrian people. We continue to deliver aid in whichever way we can, whether that's cross-line or cross-border, and we continue to be there with the Syrian people. And I think as we have from this podium quite often expressed, not only expressed our concern, but condemned the violence civilians are subjected to on a regular basis, in many, many parts of the country. Question: Can I just follow-up really quick on the Bab al-Hawa crossing? I believe that that renewal is coming up, but it's a secret renewal, at understanding, so... Let me see if I can find answer to that secret. Caitlin, Serife, and then Pam. Question: Thank you. Does UN have any comment or was it aware of this ambulance convoy that was reportedly struck by Israeli fire in Gaza as it was heading towards Rafah? I haven't seen anything from here, but I will check. Question: Also on Gaza. Do you have any updated numbers on how many UN staffers have been able to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing, foreign nationals, and have they been replaced? Spokesman: There is a rotation. It's a small number. I think it's about less than 10 about the rotation. But that is ongoing. Question: Have they been replaced? Spokesman: Yes. Some of them have been replaced. Pam. Sorry, and then Serife. Sorry, I apologise. Question: I have a separate question. But just as a follow-up to this question, total number of UNRWA in Gaza now about a thousand, I thought you said? I've always said about 13,000 UN staff in Gaza. Question: 13,000 still in Gaza? Well, I mean, they are... the vast, vast majority of them are Palestinians who live and work in Gaza. Question: Okay. And only 10 or so have swapped out? But those are internationals, and they're not... they're from different agencies that also operate in Gaza. Now my question, which is just turning to Ukraine. There have been some announcements by Ukraine that a Black Sea corridor is still working a little bit. What's the status? Is the Joint Coordination Centre in Istanbul still there? Or I mean what's...? Spokesman: I mean, the structure is still there and our efforts to revive the grain deal and fully implement the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) are also continuing. Question: Alright. Thank you. Spokesman: Serife, you've been very patient. Question: No problem at all. Thank you, Steph. So the hospitals in Gaza are continuing to be a target, despite all calls by the United Nations. And there are reports and images that Israel has targeted the vicinity of three hospitals today, Al-Shifa, Al-Quds, and the Indonesian Hospital. I want to ask, is the UN working on a plan, an initiative to enforce international law and stop Israel from targeting health facilities, basically? Spokesman: First of all, we continue to call for the full respect of international law, which includes the point that hospitals should not be used in any part of combat. But, you know, like in any conflict and we talk, I mean, just today, we've spoken about, you know, what's going on in Gaza. We've spoken about the horrific stories from Sudan. We've spoken about Ukraine. We keep calling for the respect of international humanitarian law, but in none of these cases is the UN the one with the fingers on the trigger, right? So I think that hopefully answers your question. Correspondent: Sorry, I just got this news. Spokesman: If you just got it, I didn't get it. Question: The Russian Foreign Minister said that... the Foreign Minister of Russia, [Sergey] Lavrov, has already sent a letter to the Secretary-General on de-ratifying the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Does the Secretary-General receive that letter? And what message does the Secretary-General have for both Russia and... Spokesman: I don't know if the actual letter has been received, but we've obviously seen the news, which the Secretary-General deeply regrets, and he deeply regrets Russia's revocation of the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He's consistently stressed the need for entry into force of the treaty, which is, you know, one of the main, main pillars of the global disarmament and non-proliferation architecture. He strongly urges all states that have not yet ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to do so without right of reservation or condition, especially those whose ratification is required for the treaty's entry into force. In the interim, he calls on all nuclear weapon states to publicly reaffirm their moratorium against nuclear testing and their commitment to the treaty. Celhia? Question: Steph, in the state of the world right now, do you think it's wise for the Security Council members to go on a retreat trip? Spokesman: Celhia, I have... First of all, I have no... we have no authority on what the Security Council does. We fully believe that Security Council members can do more than one thing at the same time. And, frankly, perhaps meeting in a retreat and meeting off-site can have positive developments. Question: Do you really believe so? Spokesman: Well, if I didn't believe it, I wouldn't say it. I tend to believe what I say. Yes, sir? Eric Peters at the Kyodo News. Thanks a lot. I was wondering if, so the IDF (Israel Defense Force) spokesperson announced that they had encircled Gaza City, and I was wondering if aid can still get in. I mean, we've been... it's been very difficult for us to access the northern part of Gaza. And as we've said, we're not able to deliver the humanitarian services we need to do that in those areas. Question: So nothing can reach Gaza City right now? Spokesman: That's my understanding from UNRWA is they've not been able to deliver the humanitarian aid they need to the areas in the north. Correspondent: Thank you. Spokesman: Yes, sir. Correspondent: Thank you very much. Spokesman: Sorry, the microphone. Finally, I got it. Thank you for doing this briefing on daily basis. We've heard so many characterizations for what's happening in Gaza, war crimes, genocide, a blight. How does the Secretary-General characterize it officially and formally? Spokesman: Well, read what he's been saying. Read what we've been saying. I mean, we've been characterizing, using different words since the beginning. But, I mean, I think his characterizations are reflected in his very public remarks, whether to the press or whether to the Security Council. Tony? Question: Thank you, Steph. So I remember at the very beginning of this briefing, you started with the Secretary-General contact and Tor Wennesland, what they are doing and working with different parties, but that wasn't enough information for us. Are you able to share more about these, like, very specific part of the UN role in this crisis? Spokesman: Well, I mean, our role is, I would say, is multipronged. We are continuing to speak to key interlocutors, obviously. Question: Who are they? Spokesman: Palestinian interlocutors, Israeli interlocutors, Qataris, Americans, Egyptians, and others. There are a lot of different Member States and entities that partially hold the key to solving and stopping what is going on. We share as much as we feel comfortable sharing, so as not to endanger the policies, I mean, the issues we're trying to move forward. Let me go to the screen to those who haven't had a chance, then I'll come back. Abdelhamid? Correspondent: Thank you, Stéphane. I have couple of questions. I hope you will be patient with me. First, the question about targeting the hospitals has been asked, so I won't repeat that. In the West Bank, Stephane... Spokesman: Alright. We've lost you, Abdelhamid. Question: Palestinians were killed. Israeli stormed into this. And yet the UN, we have not heard anywhere about what's going on in the West Bank in the last few days, especially about this, what happened in Jenin today. Spokesman: Abdelhamid, I think, you know, I think it's... I would encourage you to really look at the transcripts of past briefings, because we have spoken about the violence in the West Bank. We have condemned the violence by the settlers. We have underscored Israel's responsibilities to ensure the safety of all people living in the West Bank. So we have spoken about that and we continue to do so. What is your next question, sir? Question: My next question, on 30 October, Mr. Tor Wennesland had the time to go visit two Israeli settlement inside, for Arza and Be'eri. And he sat with the families of what he said suffered appalling act of terror by Hamas against women, children, and whole family. That's what his words. I've been asking you, Stéphane, for many times, why he never visited a Palestinian family? Why he didn't visit those towns that were destroyed by the settlers, including Hawwara? Spokesman: I think Mr. Wennesland has also spoken to Palestinian families. I would remind you that Martin Griffiths was also there. He met with families of Israeli hostages. He also spoke to families in Gaza. So I don't agree with your characterization. If you have a third question, go ahead. Otherwise, I'll move on. Correspondent: Just you give me one example that he visited a family from 1 January... Spokesman: I do not have his personal agenda. I do not have his personal agenda with me, but I can assure you that it's, whether it's Mr. Wennesland, his colleagues; I mean, we try to be there with people who have suffered and who continue to suffer. Let's go... Correspondent: My last question. Question: My last question. Hassan Nasrallah gave a long speech today. He's the Head of Hezbollah. First, did the UN follow that speech, in which he said that he considered himself part of what's going on. And he said he will escalate, it depends on Israel. If Israel escalates, he would increase also his involvement. Do you have any comment on this one? Spokesman: We're fully aware of the speech delivered by Mr. Nasrallah, which obviously, like many others, we're watching. I'm not going to go into an analysis or comment of everything that he said. I would just reiterate our comment and what we said earlier today and what we've been saying is the need for all those who have the power to do so to avoid any sort of escalation along the Blue Line and to cease all hostile activities across the Blue Line, as well as escalatory rhetoric. Maggie? Question: Two follow-ups, Steph. You mentioned on Monday that OCHA will increase the appeal for Gaza to $1.2 billion. Spokesman: Yes, ma'am. Question: Can we expect a donor's conference to do that? Spokesman: I don't think... we asked this morning. I don't think there will be an actual event, but it will be a release but we hope that even without a conference, donors will donate. And second, okay, so much is made of language at the UN and diplomatic language. So the Secretary-General has been calling repeatedly for humanitarian ceasefire. Today, Mr. Griffiths called it a humanitarian pause. You repeated that at the podium: pause. The Americans have been saying no to a ceasefire, okay to a pause. Is your change in language a reflection of that, because you don't think you can get better than a pause? Can you explain why? Spokesman: I think we are trying to get as much as we can, and I will leave it at that. Question: So you think that's all that's realistic? Spokesman: I will leave it at that. Edie, then Serife. And then Dawn. Question: Going back to Mali, as I recall, one of the big issues was that the authorities in Mali would not allow any aerial cover for the convoy. Is that still the case? I mean, we've had a lot of challenges getting clearance for flights. We had some medevac flights, but we're not operating as many flights as we should be able to operate in order to up the safety of our peacekeepers who are moving on the ground. Question: And is there any estimate of how many more days it's going to take? Spokesman: We hope that they get to Gao by the weekend... the end of the weekend. Serife, and then Dawn. Correspondent: Thank you again, Steph. It just took me a minute to process what you said. Obviously, the UN is not the one with the trigger on its hand, but I'm not asking this to undermine the United Nations, not at all. I'm not taking this... I just want to really know what can the UN do besides calling, you know, to stop the hostilities or condemning the brutalities? Because I think there's a huge expectation from the UN. Not just from people on the ground, but from all around the world. Spokesman: Well, you know, I think the question is which UN you are talking about, right? I can only speak for a part of that, and that's the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General, his authority in a sense is in his voice and the voice of his officials, and we continue to call on this and continue to push it publicly and continue to push it privately. There are other parts, legislative parts in the UN that could be doing more to ensure an end to this conflict. Dawn? In recent days, the United States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken has been talking about this idea of the day after in Gaza. And it's just very strange to think of the day after as if you snap your fingers is the day after. And I understand that the two-state solution is politically popular. I don't know if that's too far of a stretch to say. I know the Secretary-General supports it, but what we're dealing with here is two groups of people, Palestinians and Israelis, who've been traumatized. I'm not here to judge who more than the other. There's a lot of psychological tension there with a two-state solution. How, I mean, what is... what can be done to bring these people... How are you going to ask these people to now live together in two states when we're talking about generations of trauma? This, you know, and Antony Blinken talks about the day after, it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa. We're talking about generations of trauma. Spokesman: Right, I mean, there will be a need for a day after. There will be a need for reconciliation. There will be a need to address the violence. There'll be a need to address the trauma, and I think the international community should work in unison to ensure that goal. On that word, I've scored my last goal and I'm... oh, sorry. That's what I thought. I was hoping that was a joke, but no. Go ahead, Caitlin. Question: Can we get the Secretary-General to do a briefing if he's going to be here all week? Yes. It's on my to-do list. You're welcome."

Oga Duke in the last 4 months has grown to be the most famous and followed pet influencer in Nigeria with over 100k followers on instagram. We can’t deny that Oga Duke is a force to recon with. From the very first content, Nigerians could not deny the special bond with Oga Duke and Duke. Their contents are funny, loving and definitely so cute to watch. It’s unlike anything we’ve seen in Nigeria’s entertainment world. With thousands of influencers and content creators in Nigeria, Oga Duke has left its unique mark. Every dog lover seems to be gushing over their contents and how stylish Duke is.Oreoluwa Osoba popularly known as Oga Duke is from Ogun state Nigeria. He is a first class graudate of computer science, has lived most of his life in Lagos Nigeria and he’s the last child of his family. “Growing up I never really wanted to be noticed. I was the odd kid in class and I knew how to entertain myself in my head; I never thought I would be famous”.Oga Duke had a quiet childhood playing video games and watching a lot of movies. He loves to cook and he is really close to his immediate elder sister, Busayo. “Growing up she was my second mom and she taught me a lot like how to treat a lady right and how to be myself”.Oga duke whose contents are unique and unlike anything we have seen in Nigeria is a breath of fresh air in the entertainment industry and there is no denying that we love it.“The name “Oga Duke” comes from my dog’s name which is Duke and because I am his boss I am the Oga, hence Oga Duke” – Oga Duke.Oga Duke opened up about his unique duo with his dog “I never thought I would be a pet influencer or a content creator, but my dog and I have a unique bond and my friends would always record us when they visit and laugh so much”.Duke is a Miniature Schnauzer, Oga Duke adopted him when he was 3 months old and the minute their first video went online everyone was gushing about Duke’s personality and their bond. “ A lot of people don’t know that Duke has taught me a lot, I learnt to be more patient when I got him as I had to potty train him and teach him commands myself without a dog trainer. I also learnt to be more caring and to be more playful. I used to be really uptight but Duke is a very active, friendly and fun loving dog; he brought me out of my shell. Duke likes to meet everyone so most time I end up making friends because of him ” – Oga dukeOga Duke puts in a lot of effort in taking care of Duke as we can see from Duke’s style and fashion on his instagram page. “Duke almost has more clothes than I do, I love to dress him up but beyond the camera taking care of a dog is no joke. It’s like having a baby forever, it’s a lot of work but it’s rewarding. Dogs show love that some humans are yet to understand, they are so forgiving and live a stress free life. I wake up everyday at 6am to take Duke on a walk, feed him and groom him. It is a serious commitment. It’s one thing to adopt a dog and it’s another thing to take good care of them. My fellow dog parents please lets always take good care of our dog, we are all they got. Before getting Duke, I did a lot of research on his breed to understand him and what I was getting into; it’s important to understand your dog’s breed and to also spend time with your dog”- Oga Duke“If you have watched any of Oga Duke’s videos you can tell that Duke is well trained and well behaved, it took a lot of time and patience to train him. One thing I have learnt is that dogs always want to please their parents but they (the dogs) just don’t understand them (their parents). Once you and your dog understand each other it’s very easy from there, you just have to pay close attention to your dog and see how they react to things. That helps you understand their gestures as they can’t speak to you but they can give you signals.” – Oga DukOga Duke is a name in every Nigerian dog lover’s mouth; how does it feel? – “Honestly, I am amazed every time I go out and people say Oga Duke or people ask for a picture or ask about Duke. I am so thankful for the love.”One of the coolest things we learnt is that Oga Duke creates most of his contents from his phone and does all the editing on his phone. “Honestly, I am a phone guy. I love to create and edit on my phone; I create all my contents so far from my phone as it’s just so easy for me ” – Oga DukeFrom his phone to the world to being a YouTube partner to over a hundred thousand followers on instagram within four months, Oga Duke is taking the world by storm.Oga Duke is set to achieve world class fame “To be honest I know what I am doing is totally different and I know Nigeria is new to this; but that’s what makes it interesting to me. At first when I started posting videos some people were like, what is this? But then they started loving it, the love I have gotten so far amazes me. People ask me all the time how I come up with my contents and I tell them I don’t know; I just have the ideas and I do it. I’m not the best when it comes to writing things down so once I have an idea I shoot it immediately”Oga Duke is definitely the biggest name in the petfluencing sector in Nigeria and he hopes to achieve more by taking his fame beyond Nigeria. We are definitely rooting for the young star and can’t wait to see more of him.https://youtube.com/@ogadukehttps://www.instagram.com/ogaduke_Instagram : @ogaduke_Photographer: @deladee_edison Oreoluwa Osoba popularly known as Oga Duke is from Ogun state Nigeria.

For 25 years, the Tres Hermanos Pozoleria in Acapulco, Mexico, served 64 litres a week of pozole: a rich, stomach-warming soup made of hominy corn. It was a favourite neighbourhood haunt. Customers would belly up to the modest, brown-and-white tiled counter to order a bowl of soup, before settling into the dining tables nearby. But on the morning of October 26, the Tres Hermanos Pozoleria disappeared. All that remained was its sign, inviting customers to a pile of rubble where tables and chairs once stood. The wreckage at the restaurant reflected thedevastation across the cityas a whole. Acapulco suffered a direct hit fromHurricane Otis, a Category 5 storm that left at least 46 dead and 58 missing. Just 16 hours before it made landfall, Otis was predicted to be a Category 1 storm, the lowest level on the five-tier scale. But the hurricane intensified rapidly, defying all forecasts. When it struck Acapulco, it brought sustained winds of 270 kilometres (165 miles) per hour. Flood waters rose, power lines tumbled and the coastal city’s steep cliffs crumbled into mudslides. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States has called Otis the strongest hurricane to strike the Eastern Pacific since the advent of satellite forecasting. “It was like a water tornado, spinning and eating things up,” said Lucia Transito, one of the owners of the Tres Hermanos Pozoleria. “We saw when everything was destroyed, but more than that, we heard it.” The rapid acceleration of the hurricane’s power, fuelled in part byclimate change, gave Acapulco residents little time to evacuate. Three generations of the Transito family live together in a small, two-story house behind the restaurant. There’s Lucia, her father Santiago, her mother Beatriz Transito, her husband and their baby daughter. On the night of October 25, they huddled together on the upper floor of their home, dodging pieces of window glass blown in by the wind. When their neighbourhood, La Rinconada, flooded, the mud downstairs reached as high as their thighs. It took three days for the family to clear out all the muck. Their home was one of more than 200,000 that suffered serious damage in Acapulco. But in the restaurant, the destruction was worse. Its corrugated metal roof lay twisted in pieces atop a nest of debris: broken wicker chairs, Coca-Cola bottles filled with mud, the shattered basin of a sink and shards of tile. Though they once fed an entire neighbourhood, now the Transito family is itself without food. Seeing their need, former customers gifted them a bag of rice and one 11-litre jug of water. Lucia said she expects the supplies to last only a day. But Lucia and her family are most worried about Beatriz, the matriarch of the family. She has diabetes, and at the time Al Jazeera visited their home, she had only one day’s worth of insulin left. To make matters worse, the insulin has likely lost its potency, as the medicine needs to be refrigerated. La Rinconada has been without electricity for days. “I don’t know what effect this will have on my body,” Beatriz said, as she prepared to take the insulin. Fear kept threatening to overwhelm her, as she grappled with the overall devastation. “I look around at the damage, and suddenly it grabs me and I realize that this is actually real. I have to hold in my emotions,” she said. “We’re really living in hell, aren’t we?” Though the Mexican government sent a fleet of emergency response teams to Acapulco, none are stationed near La Rinconada. Plus, insulin is one of the few medicines they do not carry, due to the lack of refrigeration. “People keep coming up and asking for it, but we have to turn them away,” said Nohemi Morales, a nurse working with the Mexican Health Department to assist with disaster relief in the city. For Beatriz to find insulin, she would have to leave Acapulco, but the family does not have enough money to pay for her evacuation on top of the food they will need for the coming days. Some families in the neighbourhood are living off what they can scavenge from destroyed supermarkets, according to the Transitos and their neighbours. Others are selling supplies at inflated prices. Three days after the hurricane hit, the Mexican government sent 8,000 food rations and 16,000 litres of water to Acapulco to address immediate needs. But many in the city said they have yet to receive any food supplies or aid. Hearing rumours that a military jeep would dispense rations to vulnerable people, seniors and young mothers, Lucia walked to the other side of her neighbourhood on October 28 to try to get some food. Her father Santiago could not make the trip: His feet were dotted with sores from stepping on broken glass, and his only remaining shoes were a pair of flip-flops. And her mother Beatriz could not go either. Her knees are weak from her diabetes. But after reaching the jeep, Lucia said she was turned away. She had waited in a long line in the heat, only to be told she needed to show her infant child as proof that she was among the qualifying residents. “How was I going to stand there for hours with my baby?” Lucia said. On November 3, over a week after the hurricane hit, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador announced that three million boxes of rations and over a million litres of water would be sent into Acapulco for 350,000 affected residents. “We’re going to help everyone, but we had to help those most in need first,” he said in a press conference. “We’re waiting for the government. They’re our only hope,” Beatriz said. As they held out for aid, the Transito family considered using their last pesos to buy ingredients and sell the food they cooked, as they had before the hurricane. “But all of our pots were carried away by the storm,” said Lucia. The pots still held green and white pozole from the day before. Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Trees felled by gale-force winds caused several of the other deaths in Europe. In the Belgian city of Ghent, falling branches killed a five-year-old Ukrainian boy and a 64-year-old woman on Thursday.Falling trees had earlier killed a lorry driver in his vehicle in northern France's Aisne region.French officials also reported the death of a man who fell from his balcony in the port city of Le Havre.A man in the Dutch town of Venray, a woman in Madrid and a person in Germany were also killed.By 1700 GMT, 325,000 French households were still without power, mainly in Brittany and Normandy, according to Enedis power networks.

N… [+3101 chars]",Space,"NASA's Hubble Space Telescope reveals an ultraviolet view of Jupiter. NASA has just published a new image of the giant planet, Jupiter to coincide with its annual opposition this week. However, there is something extraordinary about this photo—taken by the Hubble space telescope, orbiting Earth—that makes it unique. So unique, in fact, that Jupiter’s giant storm, known as the Great Red Spot, in this image, looks blue. It comes in the wake of a fabulous infrared image of Jupiter from the James Webb Space Telescope. The image comprises only ultraviolet light, which has a much shorter wavelength than visible light. We humans cannot see ultraviolet light, but the Hubble Space Telescope is sensitive to it. It's also uniquely able to see it because it is positioned outside of that atmosphere, which blocks most ultraviolet light from entering. The image therefore makes use of false color. Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet light were captured by Hubble, each of which was then assigned a different colour—blue, green, and red—so that it makes sense to us. Great ‘Blue’ Spot Beneath the center of the image is the planet’s famous Great Red Spot, an anticyclonic storm roughly the diameter of Earth. It appears dark blue in Hubble’s new image because high-altitude haze particles absorb light at ultraviolet wavelengths, according to NASA. Believed to have been raging for at least 150 and possibly as long as 400 years, its 425 miles per hour winds swirl counterclockwise between two bands of clouds that are moving in opposite directions toward it. Shrinking Target Although it’s by far the most significant storm in the solar system, another image taken by Hubble in 2019 confirmed that the Great Red Spot is shrinking. Planetary scientists don’t know why. It’s one of the reasons Hubble looks at Jupiter close to its annual opposition—occurring this week—when Earth gets in between the sun and the planet. It’s only then that astronomers and Hubble can get a view of 100% of Jupiter’s disk. It’s also when the planet is at its brightest. The new ultraviolet image is part of research into Jupiter’s superstorm system. The next task is to use the data to map deep water clouds and define 3D cloud structures in Jupiter’s atmosphere. How To See Jupiter In Visible Light Another handy consequence of opposition is that for a few weeks on either side Jupiter rises in the east at dusk and sets in the west at dawn, making it possible to observe the giant planet at any time of night. Currently, the brightest object in the early evening sky—only Venus, which rises long after midnight, is more radiant—it’s worth putting a pair of binoculars on Jupiter. Although a telescope is required to see its Great Red Spot, binoculars will reveal four dots of light in a line around it—Callisto, Ganymede, Europe and Io, the planet’s four largest moons. Wishing you clear skies and wide eyes."

But Paulson's home, with a rounded shape that looks something like a ship, shrugged off Category 5 winds that might otherwise have collapsed it. “I wasn't nervous at all,” Paulson said, recalling the warning to evacuate. Her house lost only a few shingles, with photos taken after the storm showing it standing whole amid the wreckage of almost all the surrounding homes. Some developers are building homes like Paulson's with an eye toward making them more resilient to the extreme weather that's increasing with climate change, and friendlier to theenvironmentat the same time. Solar panels, for example, installed so snugly that high winds can't get underneath them, mean clean power that can survive a storm. Preserved wetlands and native vegetation that trap carbon in the ground and reduce flooding vulnerability, too. Recycled or advanced construction materials that reduce energy use as well as the need to make new material. A person's home is one of the biggest ways they can reduce their individual carbon footprint. Buildings release about 38% of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions each year. Some of the carbon pollution comes from powering things like lights and air conditioners and some of it from making the construction materials, like concrete and steel. Deltec, the company that built Paulson's home, says that only one of the nearly 1,400 homes it's built over the last three decades has suffered structural damage fromhurricane-force winds. But the company puts as much emphasis on building green, with higher-quality insulation that reduces the need for air conditioning, heat pumps for more efficient heating and cooling, energy-efficient appliances, and of course solar. “The real magic here is that we’re doing both,” chief executive Steve Linton. “I think a lot of times resilience is sort of the afterthought when you talk about sustainable construction, where it’s just kind of this is a feature on a list ... we believe that resilience is really a fundamental part of sustainability.” Other companies are developing entire neighborhoods that are both resistant to hurricanes and contribute less than average to climate change. Pearl Homes' Hunters Point community in Cortez, Florida, consists of 26 completed houses and 30 to be built by the end of 2024 that are all LEED-certified platinum, the highest level of one of the most-used green building rating systems. To reduce vulnerability to flooding, home sites are raised 16 feet (4.8 meters) above code. Roads are raised, too, and designed to direct accumulating rainfall away and onto ground where it may be absorbed. Steel roofs with seams allow solar panels to be attached so closely it's difficult for high winds to get under them, and the homes have batteries that kick in when power is knocked out. Pearl Homes CEO Marshall Gobuty said his team approached the University of Central Florida with a plan to build a community that doesn't contribute to climate change. “I wanted them to be not just sustainable, but resilient, I wanted them to be so unlike everything else that goes on in Florida,” Gobuty said. “I see homes that are newly built, half a mile away, that are underwater … we are in a crisis with how the weather is changing."" That resonates with Paulson, in Mexico Beach, who said she didn't want to “live day to day worried about tracking something in the Atlantic.” Besides greater peace of mind, she says, she's now enjoying energy costs of about $32 per month, far below the roughly $250 she said she paid in a previous home. “I don’t really feel that the population is taking into effect the environmental catastrophes, and adjusting for it,” she said. “We’re building the same old stuff that got blown away.” Babcock Ranch is another sustainable, hurricane-resilient community in South Florida. It calls itself the first solar-powered town in the U.S., generating 150 megawatts of electricity with 680,000 panels on 870 acres (350 hectares). The community was also one of the first in the country to have large batteries on site to store extra solar power to use at night or when the power is out. Syd Kitson founded Babcock Ranch in 2006. The homes are better able to withstand hurricane winds because the roofs are strapped to a system that connects down to the foundation. Power lines are buried underground so they can't blow over. The doors swing outward in some homes so when pressure builds up from the wind, they don't blast open, and vents help balance the pressure in garages. In 2022, Hurricane Ian churned over Babcock Ranch as a Category 4 storm. It left little to no damage, Kitson said. “We set out to prove that a new town and the environment can work hand-in-hand, and I think we’ve proven that,” said Kitson. “Unless you build in a very resilient way, you’re just going to constantly be repairing or demolishing the home.” The development sold some 73,000 acres (29,500 hectares) of its site to the state for wetland preservation, and on the land where it built, a team studied how water naturally flows through the local environment and incorporated it into its water management system. “That water is going to go where it wants to go, if you’re going to try and challenge Mother Nature, you’re going to lose every single time,” Kitson said. The wetlands, retention ponds, and native vegetation are better able to manage water during extreme rainfall, reducing the risk of flooded homes. In the Florida Keys, Natalia Padalino and her husband, Alan Klingler, plan to finish building a Deltec home by December. The couple was concerned about the future impacts global warming and hurricanes would have on the Florida Keys and researched homes that were both sustainable and designed to withstand these storms. “We believe we’re building something that’s going to be a phenomenal investment and reduce our risk of any major catastrophic situation,” Klingler said. “People have been really open and receptive. They tell us if a hurricane comes, they’re going to be staying in our place,” Padalino said. ___ The location of the Padalinos' home has been corrected to the Florida Keys, not the Panhandle.

While not unusual, the massive eruption of solar magnetic filaments on Friday was aimed in Earth’s direction. It was described as a “full-halo” CME by SpaceWeather.com. CME is short for coronal mass ejection, a cloud of magnetic fields and charged particles from the sun that streams into space at up to 1,900 miles (3,000 kilometers) per second. It can take a few days to arrive, if it’s directed at Earth, where it causes a geomagnetic storm often resulting in displays of aurora. It could strike Earth's magnetic field this weekend, said the website, suggesting the late hours of Sunday, November 5. It’s predicting a G2-class (Moderate) geomagnetic storm with auroras in northern-tier U.S. states. Early monitoring of space weather arriving at Earth suggested that the coming aurora could better than predicted. “Expect stronger than forecasted geomagnetic storm conditions up to the G3 (Kp7) level if these values persist,” said SpaceWeatherLive on X. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center’s 3-day forecast is predicting a peak between 03:00 and 06:00 UTC on Monday, which is 22:00 and 01:00 EST Sunday through Monday. Aurora result from electrons colliding with the upper reaches of Earth’s atmosphere, according to NOAA. They form around 50 to 300 miles (80 to 500 kilometers) above Earth’s surface.

The Spirit of Discovery veered to one side during a safety manoeuvre on Saturday in the Bay of B… [+1747 chars]",Weather,"Passengers on the Spirit of Discovery have described a state of fear on board the cruise ship after it was hit by a storm in the Bay of Biscay. About 100 people were injured when the ship veered dramatically during a safety manoeuvre on Saturday. Most of the injuries were described as minor by cruise company Saga, but five people were taken to hospital when the ship docked in Portsmouth on Monday. One passenger said some of those on board ""feared for their lives"". ""People were writing texts to their loved ones in case we capsized,"" the passenger told BBC News. ""The tone of voice in our captain... he was physically scared. We had crew crying. We had many passengers in awful states of fear. ""To say 'minor injuries' is an insult to the many horrific broken bones, pelvises, lacerations, stitches etc. that were caused [to] a very old passenger clientele."" The ship departed for a 14-day cruise around the Canary Islands on 24 October with about 1,000 people on board. A decision was made to return to the UK early due to worsening weather, but on Saturday the vessel encountered a storm in the Bay of Biscay - where boats often encounter notoriously rough seas. It was here that the ship's safety system kicked in, causing the vessel to veer suddenly to the left and effectively stop. A Saga spokesperson said most of the injuries occurred during this sudden movement. The ship was subsequently held in position until weather conditions improved. Jan Bendall, 75, who was on the cruise with her husband, said they were in their cabin when the captain's voice came over the speaker system and told them to ""remain seated or lie down"". She said after the ship halted, it was stationary for about 15 hours whilst ""caught in the middle of the storm"", during which she and her husband were ""holding on for dear life"". ""It was quite frightening,"" she said. ""I'm not somebody who frightens easily... it was quite dramatic."" She went on: ""We were lucky - we're quite able-bodied, but I think some of the older people and people in their own cabins were quite worried."" Passenger Alan Grisedale, who filmed the huge waves, said the swell knocked his wife over and moved furniture in their cabin. Another passenger told the BBC ""tables were flying"" and the waves were ""throwing people around all up and down the place"". Mrs Bendall said part of the dining room was converted into ""a makeshift medical area"" and passengers were told to stay in their cabins for the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday. Despite the ordeal, she said the staff were ""absolutely fantastic"". She said the crew and captain gave regular updates and repeatedly reassured passengers ""the ship is safe"". She and her husband disembarked at about 09:00 GMT on Tuesday and described seeing workers replacing glass doors, windows and partitions that had been smashed in the storm. Saga confirmed there had been ""very limited"" damage to some fixtures inside the ship but it ""remained safe at all times"". ""While the weather is clearly beyond our control, we want to offer our sincere apologies to all those affected who are now safely on their way home in calmer seas,"" the spokesperson added.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported Net Income of $29.7 million, or $1.85 in EPS, an increase of $2.8 million in Net Income, or $0.17 in EPS, compared to the first nine months of 2022. The Company’s Electric and Gas GAAP Gross Margins for the third quarter of 2023 were $22.6 million and $12.3 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company’s Electric and Gas GAAP Gross Margins were $60.6 million and $76.6 million, respectively. “Through the first nine months of 2023 we continued our strong execution, both operationally and financially, as reflected in our solid year-to-date results,” said Thomas P. Meissner, Jr., Unitil’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We remain laser-focused on our strategic initiatives and recently issued our 2023 Corporate Sustainability and Responsibility Report, which describes our commitment to sustainable practices and the steps we are taking to create long-term sustainable value for our customers, our investors, our employees, and the communities we serve.” Electric GAAP Gross Margin was $22.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $1.1 million compared to the same period in 2022. Electric GAAP Gross Margin was $60.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $3.3 million compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in the three month period was driven by higher rates and customer growth of $0.8 million and lower depreciation and amortization expense of $0.3 million. The increase in the nine month period was driven by higher rates and customer growth of $3.5 million, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $0.2 million. Electric Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP financial measure1) was $29.2 million and $80.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, increases of $0.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. These increases reflect higher rates and customer growth. ____________________1The accompanying Supplemental Information more fully describes the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release and includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the financial measures that the Company’s management believes are the most comparable GAAP financial measures. The Supplemental Information also includes a discussion of the changes in the most comparable GAAP financial measures for the periods presented.____________________ Total electric kilowatt-hour (kWh) sales decreased 4.9% and 5.0% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. Sales to Residential and C&I customers decreased 7.3% and 3.1%, respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, reflecting milder summer weather in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, partially offset by customer growth. Sales to Residential and C&I customers decreased 6.8% and 3.7%, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, reflecting warmer winter weather and milder summer weather in 2023 compared to 2022 and lower average usage, partially offset by customer growth. Based on weather data collected in the Company’s electric service areas, on average there were 12.2% fewer Cooling Degree Days (CDD) in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the number of electric customers increased by approximately 50 over the previous year. Gas GAAP Gross Margin was $12.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $1.4 million compared to the same period in 2022. Gas GAAP Gross Margin was $76.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $2.9 million compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in the three month period was driven by higher rates and customer growth of $1.8 million, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization of $0.4 million. The increase in the nine month period was driven by higher rates and customer growth of $9.3 million, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of warmer winter weather in 2023 of $1.1 million, higher depreciation and amortization of $2.9 million, and the recognition, in the second quarter of 2022, of $2.4 million in higher rates resulting from the Company's base rate case in New Hampshire. Gas Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP financial measure1) was $22.2 million and $106.4 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, increases of $1.8 million and $5.8 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. These increases reflect higher rates and customer growth of $1.8 million and $9.3 million for the three and nine month periods, respectively, and, for the nine month period, the unfavorable effects of warmer winter weather in 2023 of $1.1 million and the recognition, in the second quarter of 2022, of $2.4 million in higher rates resulting from the Company's base rate case in New Hampshire. Gas therm sales increased 3.7% and decreased 3.7% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. In the third quarter of 2023, sales to Residential customers were essentially unchanged and sales to C&I customers increased 4.1%, compared to the same period in 2022. In the first nine months of 2023, sales to Residential and C&I customers decreased 7.1% and 2.9%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2022, reflecting warmer winter weather in 2023 compared to 2022, partially offset by customer growth. Based on weather data collected in the Company’s gas service areas, on average there were 9.2% fewer Effective Degree Days (EDD) in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The Company estimates weather-normalized gas therm sales for Northern Utilities’ Maine division, the Company’s only non-decoupled gas service area, increased 3.0% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the number of gas customers increased by approximately 800 over the previous year. Operation and Maintenance expenses increased $1.0 million and $0.5 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase in the three month period reflects higher labor costs of $0.7 million, higher utility operating costs of $0.2 million and higher professional fees of $0.1 million. The increase in the nine month period reflects higher utility operating costs of $0.8 million, partially offset by lower labor costs of $0.3 million. The lower labor costs in the nine month period primarily reflect lower service costs for retirement benefits and lower restricted stock compensation. Depreciation and Amortization expense increased $0.2 million and $3.2 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase in the three month period reflects additional depreciation associated with higher levels of utility plant in service, partially offset by lower amortization of rate case costs. The increase in the nine month period reflects additional depreciation associated with higher levels of utility plant in service and higher amortization of rate case and other deferred costs. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased $0.6 million and $1.2 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022, reflecting higher local property taxes on higher utility plant in service and higher payroll taxes. Interest Expense, Net increased $0.4 million and $2.0 million, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022, primarily reflecting higher interest expense on short-term borrowings, partially offset by higher interest income on regulatory assets and other, and for the nine month period, lower interest on long-term debt. Other Expense (Income), Net decreased $0.6 million and $2.0 million, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022, reflecting lower retirement benefit costs. Federal and State Income Taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $0.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2022, reflecting higher pre-tax earnings in 2023 and higher flow back, in 2022, of excess Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes per regulatory orders in New Hampshire. In January 2023, April 2023, July 2023 and October 2023, the Unitil Corporation Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends on the Company’s common stock of $0.405 per share. These quarterly dividends result in a current effective annualized dividend rate of $1.62 per share, representing an unbroken record of quarterly dividend payments since trading began in Unitil’s common stock. The Company’s earnings historically have been seasonal and typically have been higher in the first and fourth quarters when customers use natural gas for heating purposes.

For more information please contact: Supplemental Information; Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company analyzes operating results using Electric and Gas Adjusted Gross Margins, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Electric Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated as Total Electric Operating Revenue less Cost of Electric Sales. Gas Adjusted Gross Margin is calculated as Total Gas Operating Revenues less Cost of Gas Sales. The Company’s management believes Electric and Gas Adjusted Gross Margins provide useful information to investors regarding profitability. Also, the Company’s management believes Electric and Gas Adjusted Gross Margins are important measures to analyze revenue from the Company’s ongoing operations because the approved cost of electric and gas sales are tracked, reconciled and passed through directly to customers in electric and gas tariff rates, resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in Total Electric and Gas Operating Revenue. In the following tables the Company has reconciled Electric and Gas Adjusted Gross Margin to GAAP Gross Margin, which we believe to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure. GAAP Gross Margin is calculated as Revenue less Cost of Sales, and Depreciation and Amortization. The Company calculates Electric and Gas Adjusted Gross Margin as Revenue less Cost of Sales. The Company believes excluding Depreciation and Amortization, which are period costs and not related to volumetric sales, is a meaningful measure to inform investors of the Company’s profitability from electric and gas sales in the period.

Third Quarter 2023 Highlights Management Commentary Lasse Petterson, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, ""The third quarter, as expected, was a challenging quarter due to vessel drydocks and idle equipment due to market delays from 2022 and the first half of 2023. Despite the challenges, we continued to bid on projects and build a solid backlog for the fourth quarter and for 2024. Great Lakes ended the quarter with $1.03 billion of dredging backlog, which does not include approximately $50.0 million of performance obligations related to offshore wind contracts and $225.0 million in low bids and options pending award. At the end of the third quarter, 71.2% of Great Lakes' backlog consists of capital projects. In the third quarter, we added $519.7 million in capital projects, which includes two Liquified Natural Gas (""LNG"") projects, the Brownsville Ship Channel project for Next Decade Corporation’s Rio Grande LNG project, and the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project for Marine Dredging and Disposal. The Rio Grande Brownsville LNG project is the largest project undertaken in Great Lakes' history. Our proven performance and safety culture allows us to support the growth of LNG export in the U.S., which is a necessity in balancing energy affordability and overall sustainability. In addition, we added $235.6 million in maintenance and coastal protection projects to our dredging backlog in the third quarter. As we have navigated the challenges from 2022 and have seen the ramp up in bidding in 2023, we have remained focused on cost reductions and fleet adjustments, including temporary cold stacking of vessels, and we have adjusted our general and administrative, overhead cost structures and dredging fleet to reflect the changed market conditions coming into 2023. As we have stated previously, cold stacked vessels can easily be reactivated as the market continues to improve. One of our recent project wins will allow us to reactivate a previously cold stacked vessel in the near future. In addition, our newest hopper dredge, theGalveston Islandis expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2023 and her sistership, theAmelia Island, is expected to be delivered in 2025. Also, we took delivery of our two multi cats, theCape Hatterasand theCape Canaveral, which support our strong safety culture and provide Great Lakes the ability to dredge with enhanced operating efficiencies needed to maintain our shorelines and waterways. We believe the improved dredging bid market combined with our fleet adjustments and our cost reduction and production initiatives, will position us well to achieve improved results into 2024 and beyond. We are executing on our strategy to enter the U.S. offshore wind market. On July 20, 2023, we were honored to have President Biden attend the steel cutting ceremony for Great Lakes’ offshore wind rock installation vessel, theAcadia,which marks another step forward as construction begins with expected delivery in 2025. In addition, Great Lakes signed the first ever subcontract for procurement of rock with Carver Sand & Gravel LLC, a U.S. quarry in the state of New York. Both milestones solidify our entry into the offshore wind market and will support Great Lakes' awarded rock installation contracts for the Empire Wind I and II projects with estimated installation windows in 2025 and 2026. We continue to monitor developments on related power purchase agreements (""PPA's"") after the refusal by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (""NYSERDA"") to renegotiate the agreements for Equinor and BP's Empire Wind I and II projects and Orsted's Sunrise Wind project. We expect updates from Equinor in the fourth quarter on potential impacts to their development plans for the Empire Wind projects. The U.S. offshore wind market has seen other projects delayed or cancelled due to higher interest rates and inflation. However, on October 24, 2023, the third round of PPA's for the state of New York saw 4 gigawatts (""GW"") of PPA's awarded to three operators and we continue to bid on projects with scheduled offshore installation windows in 2026 and onward."" Operational Update Market Update We continue to see strong support from the Biden Administration and Congress for the dredging industry. In December 2022, the Omnibus Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2023 was signed into law which included another record budget of $8.66 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the ""Corps"") civil works program of which $2.32 billion is provided for the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (“HMTF”) to maintain and modernize our nation’s waterways. In addition, the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2023 was approved which included $1.48 billion for the Corps to make necessary repairs to infrastructure impacted by hurricanes and other natural disasters, and to initiate beach renourishment projects that will increase coastal resiliency. Some related projects for beach renourishment have come to bid, and we expect to see additional beach renourishment work in the later part of this year. This increased budget and additional funding has resulted in a strong bid market for 2023, which we expect to continue for the remainder of the year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the bid market, not including LNG or offshore wind projects, was $1.8 billion, of which Great Lakes won 31.0%. The increase in the bid market was driven by a strong market for capital projects, which has already seen seven bids for port improvement projects including Freeport, San Juan, and Norfolk. The total capital bid market for port improvement projects through the third quarter totaled $459.2 million, of which 39% of the market year to date was won by Great Lakes. We expect the budgeted appropriations to support the funding of several previously delayed capital port improvement projects that are still expected to bid before the end of 2023, including Sabine, Houston, and Mobile. In March 2023, President Biden released the President’s Fiscal Year 2024 executive budget. The proposed amount for the Corps targets $7.4 billion, which is a record amount for a President's budget. In June 2023, the House proposed an increased 2024 budget of $9.6 billion for the Corps, which is $910 million above fiscal year 2023 and includes $2.8 billion for the HMTF and $1.5 billion for flood and storm damage reduction. In July 2023, the Senate Committee on Appropriations passed the budget which targets $8.9 billion for the Corps. This will move to the Senate floor for further deliberation and consideration. This proposed budget is expected to provide for a strong 2024 bid market. Currently, the government is operating under a continuing resolution until the budget is approved. At the end of 2022, the Water Resources Development Act of 2022, or WRDA 2022, was approved by Congress and signed into law by the President. WRDA 2022 is on a two-year renewal cycle and includes legislation that authorizes the financing of Corps’ projects for flood and hurricane protection, dredging, ecosystem restoration and other construction projects. Among many other things, WRDA 2022 featured authorization for New York and New Jersey shipping channels to be deepened to 55 feet, estimated at $6 billion, as well as the Coastal Texas Protection and Restoration Program, estimated at $34.4 billion. The Coastal Texas program includes dune and marsh restoration to safeguard the Texas Gulf Coast from hurricane surges. In addition, this legislation includes policy changes that will allow future port, waterways, and coastal projects to be more readily approved and funded. Offshore wind has been recognized around the world as a reliable source of renewable energy. Globally installed offshore wind capacity is targeted to reach about 260 GW by 2030, up from 40 GW in 2020. In 2021, the Biden Administration announced the ambitious goal of 30 GW of U.S. offshore wind by 2030 and provided $3.0 billion in federal loan guarantees for offshore wind projects. The administration’s support for offshore wind culminated in the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate mitigation act ever passed by Congress. As stated previously, Great Lakes was awarded the rock installation contracts for Equinor and BP's Empire Wind I and II projects with estimated installation windows in 2025 and 2026. The developer requested adjustments to the PPA's for these two projects which New York rejected in October and we are awaiting updates in the fourth quarter for potential impacts on the project schedules. New York continues to take steps forward in meeting their renewable energy goals with the announcement on October 24, 2023, of three new project awards with the capacity of approximately 4 GW of offshore wind energy and a new accelerated fourth bid round for additional PPA's was announced for early 2024. Vineyard Wind, the first commercial scale offshore wind farm on the East Coast recently completed installation of the first offshore wind turbine, while South Fork Wind, currently under construction, will be the first offshore wind farm to supply power to the State of New York. Although the market is facing some short-term challenges, the long-term outlook for offshore wind in the U.S. is optimistic, based on strong fundamentals and commitment by the U.S. to meet its energy independence and de-carbonization targets. Great Lakes has established a unique business position in the U.S. offshore wind market and we continue to tender bids on multiple offshore wind projects for theAcadia, our subsea rock installation vessel.

Use of Non-GAAP measures Adjusted EBITDA, as provided herein, represents net income (loss) from continued operations, adjusted for net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, debt extinguishment, accelerated maintenance expense for new international deployments, goodwill or asset impairments and gains on bargain purchase acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as an additional measure by which to evaluate the Company's operating trends. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a measure frequently used to evaluate performance of companies with substantial leverage and that the Company's primary stakeholders (i.e., its stockholders, bondholders and banks) use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the Company's period to period performance. Additionally, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides a transparent measure of the Company’s recurring operating performance and allows management and investors to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance. For this reason, the Company uses a measure based upon Adjusted EBITDA to assess performance for purposes of determining compensation under the Company's incentive plan. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with GAAP including: (a) operating income as an indicator of operating performance; or (b) cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. As such, the Company's use of Adjusted EBITDA, instead of a GAAP measure, has limitations as an analytical tool, including the inability to determine profitability or liquidity due to the exclusion of accelerated maintenance expense for new international deployments, goodwill or asset impairments, gains on bargain purchase acquisitions, net interest and income tax expense and the associated significant cash requirements and the exclusion of depreciation and amortization, which represent significant and unavoidable operating costs given the level of indebtedness and capital expenditures needed to maintain the Company's business. For these reasons, the Company uses operating income (loss) to measure the Company's operating performance and uses Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplement. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to net income (loss) from continuing operations in the table of financial results. For further explanation, please refer to the Company's SEC filings.

You would stop up the hole and bail out the water, of course! Our planet’s atmosphere is our life raft and carbon dioxide represents the water rushing in, threatening to swamp our planet’s ability to support complex life. The first, most sensible thing to do to keep civilization from “sinking” is to stop up the holes releasing CO2 into the air. This means capturing the carbon dioxide created by burning fossil fuels at their points of emission, especially at electrical generation plants and industrial facilities. “Point-source carbon capture” might not sound sexy, but if there is one thing that is going to save humanity’s bacon, this might be it. Luckily, an innovative company named Carbon Clean, founded by a youthful pair of geniuses, have developed a solution that makes point-source carbon capture relatively easy and inexpensive for industrial facilities to install. Executive Summary Carbon Clean, a global company headquartered in London but founded in India by a pair of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) wunderkinds, has made impressive technological and commercial progress on chemicals and processes to cut the cost of carbon capture for industrial facilities. The company’s modular systems, which use a proprietary solvent to trap and isolate carbon dioxide from exhaust streams, are much more efficient at capturing carbon than conventional capture processes. Carbon Clean claims to be able to cut the cost of carbon capture by up to half and says that its modular equipment packages can be installed even in the most cramped existing industrial facilities. Considering that carbon emissions from industrial sources count for 30% of total emissions, Carbon Clean’s technology holds the potential to make a significant, positive impact on efforts to restore the earth’s carbon cycle before more damage is done to our ecosystem. Carbon Clean raised $150 million in Series C funding in mid-2022 from some of the smartest money players in the business and is using the capital to expand its operations and research efforts. Founder and Company History Carbon Clean was founded in 2009 by Aniruddha Sharma and Prateek Bumb, both of whom were studying for their master’s degrees (Sharma in Statistics, Bumb in Engineering) at IIT Kharagpur—one of India’s most prestigious genius factories. Aniruddha Sharma, CEO and Chairman of Carbon Clean Sharma was born and raised in Bhopal, India, the site of the world’s worst industrial accident in 1984. At university he joined the Indian Youth Climate Network and was part of the youth delegation at COP15 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Bumb grew up in Jaipur, where he witnessed the devastating impact of climate change, with rising summer temperatures causing a decline in groundwater levels that risked severe water shortages and a potential humanitarian crisis. In 2008, Bumb undertook an internship in Italy, designing a simulation model to decarbonize an oil refinery using existing technologies. Meanwhile Sharma did an internship in Switzerland, building a predictive statistical model of factors leading to health problems. On their return to IIT in the fall, they discussed their internships and recognized an opportunity to improve the solvent at the heart of the carbon capture process. They presented a business plan at a global IIT conference, where they met a Stanford professor who advised them to start knocking on doors in the US. It was here in the States they met angel investors, venture capitalists and serial entrepreneurs, the support of whom led to the birth of Carbon Clean. Sharma and Bumb were given access to mothballed laboratory space at the Institute of Chemical Technology in Mumbai, where in 2010 they created a patentable formulation of their solvent. In 2011 they raised $1.08m in an angel round led by Blume Ventures. Securing additional funds in India was challenging but in 2012 a UK government scout visiting Mumbai suggested they apply for UK funding. In April of that year, Sharma formed a consortium of six industry partners and three UK universities, which collectively was awarded a $6.6m UK government grant, leading Carbon Clean to move to London. Carbon Clean’s Technology The most commonly used capture carbon process today feeds an exhaust stream containing CO2 into a tower filled with a chemical solvent called an “amine” in what is known as “amine-based post combustion capture.” The amine absorbs the CO2 and then the amine-CO2 molecules are isolated and heated; this releases the CO2 in a controlled way, to be separately compressed and transported to a storage facility. Meanwhile the CO2-depleted amine solution gets cycled back into the tower to catch more carbon dioxide. Amines are good at capturing CO2, but not eager to release it. It takes a lot of heat to separate the two, and over several cycles, impurities in the exhaust lower the amount of CO2 the amines capture; when this happens, capture efficiency drops, and the amines need to be replaced. The amount of energy needed to separate the amines from the CO2 imposes a real economic cost—more fossil fuels need to be burned to heat up the solution—creating a “parasitic load” that hovers around 30%. In other words, adding carbon capture to an industrial process ends up boosting total cost of production by about a third. This cost increase is the main reason companies and consumers balk at the thought of widespread implementation of this technology. Carbon Clean’s big innovation is a patented solvent that it calls APBS-CDRMax. This solvent contains both amine and salt components; amines capture CO2 with chemical bonds and the salts trap the CO2 in physical ones. The combination of the two allows Carbon Clean’s solvent to capture more CO2 and to let it go at lower temperatures, thus saving energy. Sharma, Carbon Clean’s CEO, says that his company’s solvent cuts energy costs by about a third, pushing the parasitic load of carbon capture using its technology down to around 20%. The 10-tonnes per day CycloneCC Industrial Unit. This is Carbon Clean's latest product offering. In addition to the reduction in energy-related costs, Carbon Clean’s solvent is more resistant to picking up impurities, so needs be changed out less often. It is also less corrosive than pure amine solutions and the combination of features means that total maintenance costs are also lower for a Carbon Clean system. Sharma says that adding the energy and maintenance cost savings results in total cost reductions of up to 50%. The company also sells modular equipment to capture carbon in a space-efficient way. Sharma told me that for the clients they serve—many of which are smaller industrial facilities that have been in place for years decades—facility real estate is at a premium. Carbon Clean’s modular capture systems fit into an already crowded facility with not much disruption to the customer’s operations. Climate Impact The public tends to be suspicious about carbon capture systems with a frequent complaint that carbon capture simply extends the life of fossil fuel facilities and helps Big Oil extend the life of its ecosystem-destroying business model indefinitely. This perspective is short-sighted and ignores the fact that everything we consider as part of modern civilization is built on the magical properties of fossil fuels. For as long as we want to continue using mobile phones, laptop computers, clothes made out of something other than pure cotton, hemp, linen, or wool, writing on paper, watching TV, eating food, having medicines, et cetera, we had better learn how to mitigate the damage from the combustion of fossil fuels. The most efficient way to do this is to capture carbon dioxide at its source—point-source capture. In my opinion, Carbon Clean's approach to point-source capture of the roughly 30% of global emissions stemming from industrial sources represents a vital step towards decarbonizing industries efficiently and cost-effectively. Carbon Clean’s Business Model Speaking with an investor in Carbon Clean while in New York at a venture conference a few weeks ago, I learned that the company originally went to market selling just its solvent. The solvent was so good and so effective and so resistant to contamination that customers did not need to buy as much of it. There is a problem in being too good—the company’s revenues did not increase as fast as management needed them too, so the company pivoted. The management team realized that creating and installing modular capture equipment and providing the solvent as part of their management services was a good way to make sure that the company expanded its revenues and profits quickly enough and also solved a problem for smaller emitters that did not think carbon capture solutions were within their price range. Carbon Clean’s semi-modular CDRMax solution is fully commercialized and is already being sold and implemented globally, with notable clients such as Tata Steel and NTPC in India, and Ørsted (in its FlagshipONE efuel project in Sweden). Sharma and his team have another product in development called CycloneCC, which is currently being commissioned by ADNOC at Fertiglobe’s nitrogen fertilizer plant in the United Arab Emirates, capturing roughly 10 tonnes of CO2 per day. At the heart of this innovative technology are rotating packed beds, which use a centrifugal force that enhances the CO2 absorption process to increase the efficiency of the carbon capture process. This pioneering solution puts Carbon Clean at the leading edge of innovation in capture technology and builds on a decade of engineering excellence in the sector. Carbon Clean’s solution has drawn in an eye-watering amount of smart money. In May 2022, the company closed a $150 million in a Series C funding round led by Chevron, with participation from existing investors such as CEMEX Ventures, Marubeni Corporation, and WAVE Equity Partners, as well as new investors like AXA IM Alts, Samsung Ventures, Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures, and TC Energy. The company is based in London and has offices in India, Spain and the US. Sharma has a goal now of rapidly scaling its new CycloneCC technology, aimed at overcoming the challenges of cost and scale in Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS). Sharma says that his focus on delivering effective carbon capture solutions for heavy industry reflects the urgency of addressing global emissions—as a Millennial, he can see clearly that without solving the carbon cycle imbalance humans have created through the burning of fossil fuels, our civilization is under dire threat. Erik’s Take I have become very interested in point-source capture over the last year and see this class of solutions as a necessary (though not sufficient) one to help humanity keep from hitting the climate wall that we are approaching so quickly right now. My friends at LanzaTech use biology to capture and convert carbon. My friends at Carbon Clean use chemistry. This is a case where we need an “all of the above” answer and I applaud them both. Sharma and his team know, as I know, that we must start bending the carbon emissions curve if our civilization is to have a chance at preserving a livable biosphere. Intelligent investors take note.

For example, in May, State Farm, the largest home insurer in the state, announced it wouldpause issuing policiesin California, citing wildfire risks. That came after Allstate stopped issuing policies in the state. Farmers Insurance deemed it too risky to continue insuring homes in Florida andpulled out of the marketthere entirely. “With many carriers pulling out, that leaves other companies underwriting these really expensive policies,” said Monaghan. “Policies that cost $10,000 for a year? That is impossible for some buyers who have to pay that all at once [along] with their closing costs.” In Maui and across America, climate change and extreme weather are hurting housing affordability To help a deal close, Monaghan said some motivated sellers have given two years’ worth of insurance costs to the buyer. But even if a buyer can pay their insurance costs up front (or even has them paid by the seller), buyers still have backed out of deals, worried thattheir insurance premiums will go up in the years to come. He said buyers wonder, “Will [they] be able to afford it next year? Will their policy be canceled? Then, if they can’t get another insurer, their loan gets called. It is a never-ending death spiral.” As the closing day came for his clients’ home in Bayside, it became clear the buyers had not secured insurance. Monaghanbegan calling around to help. The most affordable option he could find was $6,348 for the year. The average cost for homeowners’ insurance in the United States is about $1,820, according to an analysis by NerdWallet, but there are many variables. Ultimately, the buyers walked away. The costly policy andthe potential of rising insurance costs in years to comekilled the deal. Now, the home is back on the market. But with insurance coverage so hard to find, it’s listed for $25,000 less. “It is a very bad situation,” said Monaghan. “What insurers say goes. Even if they have flawed maps or are relying on third-party information. They think it is going to get a lot worse over time.” According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the number and severity of storms are already getting worse. America’s frozen housing market: Sales hit a 13-year low As of October 10, there have been 24 weather and climate disasterswith losses exceeding $1 billion in the United States this year, according to NOAA. These included a drought, two floods, 18 severe storms, one tropical cyclone, one wildfire, and one winter storm. Overall, these events resulted in the deaths of 373 people and had significant economic effects. By comparison, between 1980 and 2022, the typical annual average for events like this was eight. For the most recent five years, theannual average has been 18 events. As climate risks continue, a standoff has developed over who should pay the cost of insuring homes against ever-growing risks. As insurance becomes scarce in some areas and its cost surges, homebuyers are walking away from deals more often than in the past, said Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a personal insurance consumer advocacy group based in San Francisco. Although, she added, this is where the industry has been heading for some time now. “Florida and Louisiana have been having extreme property insurance drama for a while, starting from Hurricane Andrew in 1992, thenHurricane Katrina in 2005,” Bach said. “The severity of the storms and the price tag of the repairs started to get insurers’ attention.” Bach said that in places like Louisiana, insurers were shown the large-scale risk mitigations put in place in the face of more frequent and harsher storms, such as stronger levees. More remote workers are willing to move in order to find affordable housing “But I don’t think they are there yet,” she said. “Insurers are not yet accepting the value of risk reduction. They aren’t able to reduce prices, they aren’t willing to have it impact their underwriting. That is where the heart of the fight lies now.” In the meantime, she said, on top of climate change,other issues are also pushing the risk and cost even higher. “This isn’t just climate change, it is climate-change-plus,” Bach said. It is climate change, plus the Covid hangover pushing costs up,plus inflation, plus technology that allows insurers to evaluate risks in a wider array of ways. Her organization, whose main focus was once helping those impacted by disaster to recover money from insurance companies, is now primarily devoted to working on insurance availability and affordability issues. “It has evolved from a very regional crisis impacting few areas to a much bigger crisis,” said Bach. “We didn’t want to use the word ‘crisis,’ but if you talk to the homeowners in WUI [wildland urban interface] areas they would say it is a crisis.” Still, Bach said, it is important to keep the crisis in perspective. In California, for example, the share ofhomeowners using FAIR plan— the insurer of last resort made up of a syndicated fire insurance pool comprised of all insurers licensed to issue property and casualty in the state — remains under 5%, according to the California Department of Insurance. While insurers have always dropped out of markets or changed their conditions in reaction to a policy, Bach said a competitor would always move in. “Competition would, in fact, heal the wound,” she said. “But that isn’t happening now.” “We are in a world in which natural disasters are more common and more severe, and we are in a state with diverse housing,” said Jennifer Branchini, a Compass agent in Pleasanton and president of the California Association of Realtors. “It is this insurance expense that everyone is now concerned about. Yes, it is expensive to rebuild. What is that doing to the market when it is being put on the homeowner or the person who would like to purchase the house?” In a recent survey of CAR members, only 7% of agents said they had deals fall through. But of those, a whopping 61% said the deal fell through because insurance was not available to the client. An additional 19% fell through because the premium was too expensive. And it isn’t just the lower- or mid-priced homes. Home affordability is the worst it has been since 1984 Branchini heard from a California agent who represented a buyer in the purchase of an $8.2 million property. “The only insurance they could get was through State Farm for $210,000 a year,” she said. “Three days later, State Farm paused new coverage. They lost that insurance. That buyer walked away.” The affordability and availability of insurance is one more thing in the perfect storm of thecurrent rough housing market,said Branchini. “Buyers are facing high interest rates,” she said. “There is already a lack of availability and lack of affordability. And for many of the properties that are on the market you can’t obtain insurance? Or it is very unaffordable insurance?” She remains hopeful that competition and creativity will help the housing market. “We’ll have to see some creative solutions in the near term to create that competitive marketplace for insurance,” she said."

Analysis suggests it was the most intense tornado recorded in the United Kingdom for nearly 70 years with wind-speeds estimated to be around 160-190mph (260-300km/h). Disruption to daily life and services continue across Jersey. Tornadoes in the UK occur more commonly that you might think, with 36 a year on average reported. That figure is according to Torro (Tornado and Storm Research Organisation), which conducts investigations after suspected tornadoes to keep records and continue research. Most confirmed tornadoes are however relatively small and cause minor damage. In Jersey, Torro site investigations concluded that an intense tornado made landfall at St Clement and traversed the island at around midnight on Thursday 2 November. Severe damage was found along an 8km stretch of the island before it appeared to exit around Fliquet. After assessing the damage, it has been determined that the tornado was likely to be a ""T6 tornado"" based on the International Tornado Intensity Scale - from T0 to T10. T6 tornadoes are classed as ""moderately devastating"" with damage typically comprising of brick and wooden framed houses wholly demolished, cars thrown over, noticeable de-barking of trees and steel-framed constructions being severely damaged or destroyed. In a press release, Torro suggests that there have only been a few tornadoes of T6 intensity and greater in the UK, Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man over the last century, and therefore ""this is easily the strongest on record for the Channel Islands"". The Jersey tornado was also more powerful than the Birmingham tornado of July 2005 which was rated T5/6 and caused damage estimated at £40 million. It is also likely the most intense since the Gunnersbury (West London) tornado of December 1954, which was rated T7. Torro has also assessed damage seen in West Sussex during Storm Ciarán and concluded a T2 tornado went through Sompting and North Lancing on the morning of 4 November. The clear-up continues in the Channel Islands with some schools yet to be reopened. While they tend to be small and cause minor damage, tornadoes can occur all year round but are most common in August. They tend to form when there are severe thunderstorms with frequent lighting, hail and gusty winds. In these storms, rotations can occur in the base of the cumulonimbus cloud which extends down to the ground. It only becomes a tornado if the spout touches the ground. If it doesn't, it's only a funnel cloud. The UK has its own UK's 'tornado alley' identified which is in an area between Reading and London. It's here that a study by the University of Manchester found there was a 6% chance of a tornado each year. The researchers say that this means a tornado is likely once every 17 years."

Nissan is addressing that problem by discontinuing the Titan in 2024. But Stellantis is sticking around and giving its big trucks a significant update that includes dropping all V8 engines and adding a new Ramcharger variant with a V6 and a battery that they really don’t want anyone to call a plug-in hybrid. A Mild Facelift Spy photos of the 2025 Ram trucks have been floating around online for months and the fact that only the front and rear of the truck have been extensively covered gives a strong hint about the extent of the redesign, which is to say not very extensive. Most of the sheet metal is carried over and frankly that’s not a problem. Despite being familiar, the Ram 1500 is arguably still the best looking full-size truck on the market. 2025 Ram 1500 Tungsten The headlamp clusters have gotten slimmer and on Limited trims and above, they now feature standard twin bifunctional LED projectors. In between is a slightly wider grille that now has a bit of a forward lean to it, just in case modern trucks don’t look imposing enough. New for 2025 is an even more premium luxury truck above the Limited called Tungsten. The Tungsten trim was first previewed earlier this year on the Ram 1500 Rev electric pickup. On the internal combustion Tungsten, there are other changes to the front fascia including the elimination of the traditional steel bumper found on trucks in favor of a bumper cover that is more integrated into the design. This gives a cleaner, more upscale look to a truck that isn’t intended to go any further off-road than the dirt path to your lakeside cabin. 2025 Ram 1500 Tungsten On the inside, the Ram remains relatively familiar which again is a good thing. Even after multiple years on the market, the Ram 1500 still has the best looking and feeling cabin among large trucks. The materials and colors get a further upgrade for the new year and the touchscreens are also improved. 2025 Ram 1500 The 12-inch portrait style infotainment screen has a new higher resolution display on lower end trims. The top trims now get an even larger 14.5-inch screen and front passengers can also have their own 10.25-inch display just like the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Cherokee with a filter that prevents the driver from viewing the screen. There are now 6 USB ports in the front (3 each of type-A and type-C) plus 4 for the back seat. The larger screen is flanked by dedicated climate control buttons so you don’t have to search through menus for a quick temperature adjustment. New Tech Features The 2025 Ram 1500 is the first Stellantis product to offer hands-free driver assistance capability similar to Ford BlueCruise and GM Super Cruise. The hands-on Active Driving Assist helps keep the truck centered in the lane on all roads. When running on approved mapped roads the driver can go hands off but must continue watching the road with an infrared camera watching the driver’s eyes and hand position to make sure they are attentive. Ram is also debuting a new premium audio setup for 2025 powered by Klipsch. 2025 Ram 1500 Tungsten speaker cover Ram has also added a trailer hitch assist system similar to the one offered by Ford on the F-series trucks. Using the rear backup camera and other sensors, it can automatically back up the truck and align the hitch ball with the trailer for easy connection. Like Ford’s current trucks, the gas Rams will offer electrical outlets in the bed with an inverter that can output up to 2-kW for tools or other gear. The End of the Hemi It should come as a surprise to no one that the 2025 Ram 1500 no longer offers any V8 engines. As the best selling Stellantis vehicle in North America, the Ram trucks have a significant influence on the automaker’s corporate average fuel economy and while the Hemi V8s were strong, they were thirsty. With the worst CAFE numbers in the industry, Stellantis needed to improve. The veteran reliable and cheap 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 with the eTorque mild hybrid system remains the standard engine in the new Ram. 2025 Ram 1500 Rebel But for those that need more capability, the 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged Hurricane inline six that debuted last year in the Wagoneer is now the upgrade option with two different power levels. The standard output variant produces 420-hp and 469 lb-ft of torque easily outdoing the 5.7-liter Hemi. The high-output version produces 540-hp and 521 lb-ft, even more than in the Wagoneer. This aluminum block and head engine is designed to be extremely robust with cross-bolted steel main bearing caps and plasma coated cylinders that are tougher than steel liners. Ram officials won’t say what the Hurricane is actually capable of producing, but there have been hints that with more boost, it may be able to rival the soon to be discontinued Hellcat supercharged V8. 2025 Ram 1500 power outlets With that 700-hp blown Hellcat going out of production at the end of 2023, the TRX badge is also being put on the shelf for the time being. Ram chief Tim Kuniskis won’t say if it will come back, but the “on-the-shelf” comment hints that we might someday see it again. Until that happens, the high-speed desert running capability of the TRX is being largely carried over in the new RHO model powered by the high-output Hurricane engine. With 540-hp, it does still outpace the 450-hp 3.5-liter EcoBoost in the standard F-150 Raptor. Don’t Call It a Hybrid Ram 1500 Ramcharger Back in June 2021, when Stellantis laid out its master plan for going electric, several vehicles were hinted at, but no details were provided. Those have been slowly trickling out in the more than two years since. One of those hints was a reference to a range extender electric pickup. In April of this year, we saw the Ram 1500 Rev with a claimed range of up to 500 miles thanks to a massive 229 kWh. The range extender has been hinted at several times, but only now do we have actual details in the form of the Ram 1500 Ramcharger with at least two instances of name redundancy. Despite insisting on not calling the Ramcharger a hybrid, it is in fact a plug-in series hybrid. There are two main forms of hybrid powertrain, the parallel hybrid where both an engine and electric drive system can power the wheels as with most hybrids on the road today. The other is a series hybrid where the engine is only used to drive a generator that produces electricity to charge the battery and electric motors drive the wheels. Ram 1500 Ramcharger Tradesman The original Chevrolet Volt concept of 2007 was a series hybrid but by the time the car made it to production, reuse of off-the-shelf components to save cost turned it into more of a parallel in some driving cases. The Fisker Karma was a plug-in series hybrid and Nissan’s current e-Power systems in Japan are too, although they have a smaller battery and no plug, so the engine charges the battery continuously. The Ramcharger is another kind of beast. Like the Rev, it’s built on the STLA Frame EV platform. The gas engined trucks and utility vehicles from Stellantis have frame rails that run essentially straight from front to rear. The STLA Frame version has rails that spread outward between the axles, allowing room for a larger battery like that used by GM. The Ford Lightning uses a modified version of the ICE frame with straight rails, constraining the size of the battery to just 130 kWh compared to the 168-kWh standard battery in the Rev. Ram 1500 Ramcharger The Ramcharger gets a 92-kWh battery not much smaller than the standard 98-kWh unit in the Lightning. In the Ramcharger, this battery is projected to deliver about 145 miles of electric range. Propulsion comes from the same front and electric drive units as the Rev, putting out 663-hp and 615 lb of torque. That’s enough for a projected 0-60 mph time of 4.4 seconds. Sitting above the front drive unit is a modified Pentastar V6 with an electric generator bolted to the back of the block. The generator can produce up to 130-kW continuously and up to 190-kW to meet transient demand. By default, the Ramcharger runs on juice from the battery and as it approaches about 20% state of charge, the V6 generator combination comes on to maintain or build the level of the charge in the main battery. Between the battery and rear axle there is a 27-gallon gas tank. The combination is expected to deliver a range of about 690 miles. Ram 1500 Ramcharger Like the plug-in hybrid 4XE system on Jeeps, the Ramhcharger offers multiple modes including Eco, e-Save and Electric+. The e-Save mode forces the generator to run, preserving the battery charge for a later time or building up the charge for an anticipated extra load such as climbing a long grade while towing a heavy trailer. Like the Rev, the Ramcharger will be able to tow 14,000-lbs and will have a payload capacity of 2,625-lbs. That’s about double the payload capacity of the Silverado EV and 400-lbs more than the lightest version of the Lightning. While the maximum range while towing depends on multiple variables such as the size and aerodynamic characteristics of the trailer as well as terrain, Ram engineers estimate that it should be able to tow a large trailer at least 300 miles over relatively flat terrain when starting with a full charge. The presence of the V6-generator combination means that unlike the Rev, the Ramcharger won’t be able to offer a frunk. But for those that need to tow over long distances while also having a truck that handles virtually all daily driving without using any gas, the Ramcharger is a unique combination with far more capability and electric range than any other plug-in hybrid in the world. Ram 1500 Ramcharger The Ramcharger is expected to launch at the same time as the Rev in late 2024 but like the battery electric truck, Ram isn’t talking pricing yet. However, Kuniskis did highlight the cost of the 76-kWh difference in battery size between the Ramcharger and standard range Rev. Assuming a conservative estimate of $120/kWh for the battery, the smaller battery of the Ramcharger could save over $9,000 in battery cost. Adding in $4,000 to $5,000 for the generator and associated hardware, the Ramcharger could end up being at least several thousand dollars cheaper to build if not necessarily to buy and it will probably roughly the same weight as the standard range Rev with a full tank of fuel. Ram 1500 Ramcharger A trio of electric full-size truck variants could be just the combination that Stellantis needs to make a real dent in the market despite being somewhat late to enter. Between 2 battery only versions with 350 to 500 miles of a range and a version with an on-board generator to keep the battery at a useful state of charge, this could be just what Stellantis needs to make its CAFE compliance goals. Kuniskis declined to say how many Revs and Ramchargers they expect to sell, but did say that they need at least 20% of their trucks electrified to hit Stellantis’ compliance requirements while the company has a broader target of 50% BEV market share by 2030. So Ram will probably be targeting about 80,000 to 100,000 sales of its battery propelled trucks in the early years. The new Hurricane-powered gas Ram 1500s will go on sale in early 2024 with the Rev and Ramcharger in the fourth quarter."

These seismic waves are so powerful and widespread that they show up as a steady thrum on seismographs, the same instruments used to monitor and study earthquakes.That wave signal has been getting more intense in recent decades, reflecting increasingly stormy seas and higheroceanswell.In anew studyin the journalNature Communications, colleagues and I tracked that increase around the world over the past four decades. Theseglobal data, along with other ocean, satellite and regional seismic studies, show a decadeslong increase inwave energythat coincides with increasing storminess attributed to risingglobal temperatures.What seismology has to do with ocean wavesGlobal seismographic networks are best known for monitoring and studying earthquakes and for allowing scientists tocreate imagesof the planet's deep interior.Thesehighly sensitive instrumentscontinuously record an enormous variety of natural and human-caused seismic phenomena, includingvolcanic eruptions, nuclear and other explosions, meteor strikes, landslides andglacier-quakes. They also capture persistent seismic signals from wind, water and human activity. For example, seismographic networks observed the global quieting in human-caused seismic noise as lockdown measures were instituted around the world during the coronavirus pandemic.However, the most globally pervasive of seismic background signals is the incessant thrum created by storm-drivenocean wavesreferred to as the global microseism.Two types of seismic signalsOcean waves generate microseismic signals intwo different ways.The most energetic of the two, known as thesecondary microseism, throbs at a period between about eight and 14 seconds. As sets of waves travel across the oceans in various directions, they interfere with one another, creating pressure variation on thesea floor. However, interfering waves aren't always present, so in this sense, it is an imperfect proxy for overall ocean wave activity.Ocean wave intensification since the late 1980s: Each circle is a seismic station, with size proportional to the vertical acceleration of the Earth at that station smoothed over three years. Red circles indicate periods when ground motions are larger than the historical median; blue indicate periods when they are smaller. The synchronized graph shows the median vertical acceleration anomaly for all stations and reflects El Niño cycles and a more pronounced increase in recent years. Credit: Rick AsterA second way in which ocean waves generate global seismic signals iscalled the primary microseism process. These signals are caused by traveling ocean waves directly pushing and pulling on the seafloor. Since water motions within waves fall off rapidly with depth, this occurs in regions where water depths are less than about 1,000 feet (about 300 meters). The primary microseism signal is visible inseismic dataas a steady hum with a period between 14 and 20 seconds.What the shaking planet tells usIn our study, we estimated and analyzed historical primary microseism intensity back to the late 1980s at 52seismograph sites around the worldwith long histories of continuous recording.We found that 41 (79%) of these stations showed highly significant and progressive increases in energy over the decades.The results indicate that globally averaged ocean wave energy since the late 20th century has increased at a median rate of 0.27% per year. However, since 2000, that globally averaged increase in the rate has risen by 0.35% per year.We found the greatest overall microseism energy in the very stormy Southern Ocean regions near the Antarctica peninsula. But these results show that North Atlantic waves have intensified the fastest in recent decades compared to historical levels. That is consistent with recent research suggestingNorth Atlantic storm intensityandcoastal hazardsare increasing.Storm Ciarán, which hit Europe with powerful waves and hurricane-force winds in November 2023, was one record-breaking example.The decades-long microseism record also shows the seasonal swing of strong winter storms between the Northern and Southern hemispheres. It captures the wave-dampening effects of growing and shrinking Antarctic sea ice, as well as the multi-year highs and lows associated with El Niño and La Niña cycles and their long-range effects on ocean waves and storms.Together, these andother recent seismic studiescomplement the results from climate and ocean research showing that storms, and waves, are intensifying as the climate warms.A coastal warningThe oceans have absorbed about90% of the excess heatconnected to rising greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in recent decades. That excess energy can translate intomore damaging waves and more powerful storms.Our results offer another warning for coastal communities, where increasing ocean wave heights can pound coastlines, damaging infrastructure anderoding the land. The impacts of increasing wave energy are further compounded by ongoingsea level risefueled by climate change and by subsidence. And they emphasize the importance of mitigating climate change and building resilience into coastal infrastructure and environmental protection strategies."

Credit: AP Photo Bob Edme, FileThis year has been so exceptionally hot in part because oceans have been warming, which means they are doing less to counteract global warming than in the past. Historically, the ocean has absorbed as much as 90% of the excess heat from climate change, Burgess said. And in the midst of an El Niño, a natural climate cycle that temporarily warms parts of the ocean and drives weather changes around the world, more warming can be expected in the coming months, she added.Schlosser said that means the world should expect more records to be broken as a result of that warming, but the question is whether they will come in smaller steps going forward. He added that the planet is already exceeding the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times that the Paris agreement was aimed at capping, and that the planet hasn't yet seen the full impact of that warming. Now, he, Burgess and other scientists say, the need for action—to stop planet-warming emissions—is urgent.""It's so much more expensive to keep burning these fossil fuels than it would be to stop doing it. That's basically what it shows,"" said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London.

With temperatures soaring beyond previous averages by exceptional margins, scientists say the pressure on world leaders to curb planet-heating greenhouse gas pollution has never been more urgent as they prepare to meet in Dubai for the UNCOP28 climate conference this month. Drought parched parts of the United States and Mexico during October, while huge swathes of the planet saw wetter than normal conditions often linked to storms and cyclones, said the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). Sea surface temperatures were the highest ever recorded for the month, a phenomenon driven by global warming that scientists say plays a key role in driving storms to be more ferocious and destructive. ""October 2023 has seen exceptional temperature anomalies, following on from four months of global temperature records being obliterated,"" said Samantha Burgess, C3S Deputy Director. ""We can say with near certainty that 2023 will be the warmest year on record, and is currently 1.43 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average. The sense of urgency for ambitious climate action going into COP28 has never been higher."" The landmark Paris Agreement saw nearly 200 countries pledge to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era and preferably a safer 1.5C. These temperature thresholds will be measured as an average over several decades, rather than a single year. This year has also seen the beginning of a warming El Nino weather phenomenon -- which warms waters in the southern Pacific and stokes hotter weather beyond -- although scientists expect the worst effects to be felt at the end of 2023 and into next year. October was 1.7C warmer than an estimate of the October average for the preindustrial era, Copernicus said. Global average temperatures since January have been the highest in records going back to 1940, the monitor added, registering 1.43C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average. Beyond these official records, scientists say proxy data for the climate going back further -- like tree rings or ice cores -- suggests the temperatures seen this year could be unprecedented in human history, potentially the warmest in more than 100,000 years. Average sea surface temperatures for the month excluding the polar regions also reached all-time highs for October, at 20.79C. Oceans have absorbed 90 percent of the excess heat produced by human activity since the dawn of the industrial age, according to scientists. Warmer oceans are linked to an increase in the intensity of storms and the melting of crucial ice shelves buffering the vast ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, threatening destructive sea level rise. A warmer atmosphere also holds more moisture, resulting in heavier rainfall. Leaders meeting in the United Arab Emirates for the November 30 to December 12 COP28 conference will have to respond to a damning progress report on the world's Paris pledges after major scientific reports have made clear that the world is far off track. Carbon emissions -- largely from fossil fuels -- continue to creep up when they need to be slashed in half this decade. Just under 1.2 degrees Celsius of temperature rise above pre-industrial levels has triggered a range of calamitous and costly weather extremes. People across the planet have faced heatwaves and droughts this year, while severe flooding has struck in the US, China and India and beyond. The report warned that humanity had veered into ""uncharted territory"" with warming that imperils life on Earth. Lead author William Ripple, a professor at Oregon State University said it was likely that annual average temperatures would start to be recorded above 1.5C. ""As warming continues, we face increasing danger from amplifying climate feedback loops and tipping points such as ice sheet melting and forest dieback,"" he said. ""Once crossed, these tipping points could change our climate in ways that may be difficult or impossible to reverse."""

In the early hours of August 30, 2023, Hurricane Idalia made its first landfall in the Big Bend region of western Florida. Over the following 48 hours, the Category 3 storm ravaged Florida's Gulf Coast and Georgia's southern border before eventually moving up into the Carolinas. Winds that reached around 125 miles per hour devastated local homes, businesses, vehicles and everything else in its path as it tore through the region. Hurricane Idalia was the strongest storm to hit the region in more than 125 years, leaving an estimated $20 billion in damages in its wake. Yet Idalia's projected financial impact is a fraction of Hurricane Ian's nearly $60 billion in damages from 2022 and is just the most recent of 23 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in 2023. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 2023 set a new record for billion-dollar disasters in a single year in just eight months. The unfortunate reality is that these extreme weather events can no longer be categorized simply as ""once-in-a-lifetime"" occurrences. It's no coincidence that these natural disasters are striking at a growing frequency year after year and that climate change's role in such disasters will only continue to rise as inaction to properly address it perpetuates. We're at a crucial moment in our history where a shift in narrative isn't just sensible—it's imperative. Unless meaningful and impactful changes are made, these disasters are only going to become more extreme and more devastating for the communities that are affected. Public and private organizations, from school systems and businesses to healthcare facilities and government offices, will need to have the proper infrastructure in place to be prepared for what our future currently portends. Sustainable, energy-resilient technology such as distributed generation systems can play a significant role in easing the transition from traditional, centralized energy networks to renewable sources of clean energy. However, adopting these technologies takes more than just incorporating tools and products; it requires a transformative shift in the way an organization operates. Effectively and successfully incorporating a renewable energy infrastructure starts with adopting sustainability as a core value of the organization. Through education and awareness initiatives, ensuring organizational alignment from leadership to employees and key stakeholders on sustainability goals is an important first step in beginning the clean-energy transition. Then, by establishing baseline values for energy and emissions under the current operational structure, an organization can assess and set milestones to guide it toward achieving its goal. By determining where the organization stands in regard to its current energy consumption, it can begin to develop a roadmap and budget for how it can set out to achieve its sustainability goals. Whether through the implementation of solar panels or switching to a geothermal heating and cooling system, the strategic milestones should reflect the organization's near-term, mid-term and long-term goals, with each focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Working with an experienced energy partner to assist in retrofitting and updating the organization's infrastructure can help ease the transition as well as ensure the successful delivery of the overall project. However, even after the new efficient energy structure is in place, an organization must continuously monitor, analyze and adjust its mid-term and long-term strategies to make the journey to net zero emissions a reality. Still, getting to this point isn't without its challenges. According to a report from the World Wildlife Fund and Carbon Disclosure Project, there are three main barriers for companies and organizations seeking to move forward with climate protection initiatives: lack of expertise, access to capital and lack of management attention. Organizations could look to outsource the complexity of this process through the help of a strategic partner operating within an energy-as-a-service (EaaS) model and work hand in hand with a solutions provider to develop a net-zero and resiliency strategy tailored to the unique needs of that organization. If now still isn't the time to transition to these cleaner, energy-resilient solutions, then when will it be? Our climate and weather patterns have clearly responded to our current global output of carbon and greenhouse gasses, and unless change is made, that response is only going to get louder. It's time for us to respond firmly and resolutely and continue to take the necessary steps to reach zero emissions by 2050—if not sooner.

[+] by Owen Humphreys/PA Images via Getty Images) The northern lights—also called the aurora borealis—could be visible in northern U.S. states after a spike in magnetic activity on the sun on Thursday, November 9. It comes after a correctly predicted stunning display last Sunday when a strong geomagnetic storm produced aurora in the night skies for northern U.S. states and Europe. Aurora was glimpsed as far south as Greece and Italy. According to SpaceWeather.com, the incoming geomagnetic storm won’t be as strong as last weekend’s G3-class event, but it could still produce G2 activity levels. That could be enough to make aurora visible in northern U.S. states from New York to Washington, said the website. It could also mean a second scientific rocket launch by NASA in Alaska. Saturday Night Lights That assertion is based on space weather models produced independently by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA. The former’s Space Weather Prediction Center has issued a three-day forecast that predicts for Saturday a G1 magnetic storm from 15:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. EST) with a G2 magnetic storm from 18:00-03:00 UTC (13:00-10:00 p.m. EST). A G1 is predicted to follow until -6:00 UTC (01:00 a.m. So, anyone in northern U.S. states looks set to have the possibility of aurora in the northern skies from darkness through midnight. If you can, get away from light pollution and have a manual camera on a tripod that can take long exposure images (try f2.8-4, ISO 1600, 20 seconds). Charged Particles The culprit is another coronal mass ejection, a cloud of magnetic fields and charged particles from the sun that streams into space at up to 1,900 miles (3,000 kilometers) per second. Crucially, this one is headed toward Earth. Displays of the aurora are caused by events that super-charge the solar wind, a flow of charged particles from the sun. As the particles collide with Earth’s magnetic field, they accelerate down its magnetic field lines. They produce an oval of green and red around our planet’s poles. Expanding Oval When solar activity is high—as it is right now—that oval expands. It’s common to see the aurora from the Arctic Circle, at around 65- to 70-degree north latitudes, in regions like Alaska, northern Canada, Iceland, Lapland (northern Norway, Sweden and Finland) and northern Russia. When solar activity is high—as it is right now—that oval expands, with the aurora being visible at lower latitudes. The sun is currently nearing the peak of its present solar cycle, which is proving to be much stronger than the last one. A solar cycle lasts roughly 11 years. The SWPC recently published an update to its prediction for the current solar cycle, pinpointing the height of the sun’s activity—called solar maximum—to occur between January and October 2024. Wishing you clear skies and wide eyes."

Climate finance and the $100 billion goal (Photo Illustration by Matt Cardy/Getty Images) Wealthy countries pledged 15 years ago to mobilize $100 billion annually to support climate action in developing countries. However, the full promised amount is yet to reach these countries with a gap in funding amounting to as much as $20 billion. This gap represents a lost opportunity for approximately 30 million hectares of tree restoration—an area twice the size of Bangladesh—and a missed chance to install thousands of early warning systems for extreme weather events, such as storms and hurricanes, in Haiti. The problem is that there is more talking about climate finance than actually giving away money. The process of giving money is often complicated and slow. In many cases, small island countries and developing nations do not even have the resources to go through the rigorous technical process. There has been some movement in simplifying the application process but it is not enough given the pace of urgency. Negotiators from around the world will gather at the end of this month in Dubai for COP28, the biggest annual gathering on climate change of government officials from over 170 countries. Climate finance is a crucial item on the agenda, with an entire day dedicated to the topic and further discussions planned on a new collective quantified goal for climate finance. Over the past year, discussions have centered on the components of this goal, including the key players, the milestones and the total figure, estimated to be as much as $5.8 to $5.9 trillion up until 2030. To have meaningful impact, the billions missing due to delays in technical approval and ineffective spending should not be ignored. Thus, while the specifics of the new climate collective goal are critical, scrutinizing the effectiveness of existing fund deployment (speeding up the process and learning from funds allocated to unsatisfactory projects) is equally important to ensure that climate finance leads to tangible climate action. NAKURU, KENYA - 2021/12/31: View of indigenous trees felled and split by illegal loggers in the ... [+] forest. (Photo by James Wakibia/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Speed Up The Process Often the time taken for project funding approval from public funds is so long that even though the pot of money is ready to be given, it is unable to reach the vulnerable people fast enough. Hundreds of projects get stuck in pipeline due to this and never see the light of the day. These approval proposals are extensive documents, often requiring significant time and highly skilled resources to complete—resources that are lacking in many developing nations. Two of the largest sources of public climate funding are the Global Climate Fund and the Global Environment Facility. To illustrate their scale, between 2020 and 2023, GCF managed over $10 billion across 128 countries through 209 projects. Meanwhile, GEF has $10 billion to allocate through its current and previous funding cycle. The cycle for project approval to receive funding through these agencies is highly rigorous. It involves developing a detailed project proposal, which broadly identifies the problem to be addressed and the proposed solutions. For example, a GEF proposal ‘Strengthening the National Transparency System in Brazil under the Paris Agreement’ spans about 121 pages. In recent years, Global Climate Fund has initiated efforts to simplify the approval process, resulting in most of its project proposals being around 20 pages. This is a step in the right direction but not enough as reduction in pages alone cannot guarantee success of the projects. The time taken for project approval process continues to be rather long, this is more when the countries are small and do not have the capacity. For instance, a climate project to support fisherman in vulnerable coasts of Vanuatu, a group of tiny islands in South Pacific Ocean with a population of only 300,000 people, took 812 days for approval. This pace of approval cannot be expected to deliver on our climate ambitions. Learning From Past Missteps For money directed to climate to be effectively utilized, it is essential to highlight the lessons learned from less successful projects and share this knowledge with all key stakeholders. There is also a need to review ongoing operations with below-satisfactory implementation ratings to determine whether lessons from older, closed projects are being applied. About 420 of the 2,000 projects funded by GEF have been rated unsatisfactory, according to an independent evaluation. What that means is they were unable to meet the expected targets that they claimed to fulfil. This represents potentially millions of dollars of taxpayers' money spent on unsuccessful projects. Africa and Latin America have the highest number of unsatisfactory projects, despite being among the region’s most vulnerable to climate change. The allure of setting a new quantifiable goal for climate finance is clear, yet it is vital to shift our focus beyond mere figures and toward enhancing impact of funds, fast-tracking the missing billions that couldn’t reach the beneficiaries and the billions that were approved in the $100 billion target, but failed to bring results."

[+] properties due to climate events. For most of the U.S. population, summarizing a home as shelter is a fairly gross underrepresentation of what a home actually delivers, but now many are looking for shelter from more extreme climate events that are capable of reducing our current housing to underperforming shelters. While the challenges have always existed, global real estate data platform CoreLogic reports ever-increasing risks and that now more than 18 million properties valued at $8 trillion are at extreme risk. There are mechanisms in place for protection, such as building codes, insurance, better forecasting, and new design with better performing materials, however, even these mechanisms are proving to have failure points, and sometimes major gaps. Growing Risks Risks are defined in many ways, and to make things even more complicated, housing stakeholders look at them through completely different lenses. A home insurance company evaluates risk differently than the builder, who is different than the homeowner, who is different than the architect. These disparities certainly don’t help the situation, but at the same time, none of the stakeholders can argue with the looming danger of stronger weather events. CoreLogic’s data analyzes property-level physical attributes, property-level financial data, specific peril impacts, and a variety of climate scenarios, to understand the current and future financial impact. The company’s data also takes the age of the housing stock into account, making both granularity and scale important in the outputs. “What CoreLogic does is identify the financial risk for every property in the U.S.,” said Anand Srinivasan, who acts as executive of innovation at CoreLogic. “If the property is greater than 100 square feet, then we have calculated loss estimates and created risk scores that incorporate present and future climate risk. Now, we are getting demand from government officials to look at longer periods because of capital investments.” The data provides a holistic view of all potential hazards, including floods, hurricane winds, wildfires, severe convective storms, severe winter storms, along with earthquake activity. From there, the data can help identify the top risks in financial terms by looking at potential loss, making CoreLogic a useful tool for insurance companies and mortgage originators in underwriting and financial evaluations of properties and policies and portfolios of properties. The data is comprehensive and overwhelming, but the value of the data is critical to all the stakeholders. “We look at the delineation between coverage amount and the mortgage amount, the home value, the equity value, and the reconstruction costs,” Srinivasan said. “And, they all are moving targets, but it helps articulate the risk and then helps define actions on what could be done to reduce the risk and has an impact on what the owner would do.” There are dozens of examples. For instance, the Federal Reserve Board has published a paper using CoreLogic data to identify what destroys a community, defined by the tipping point for consumers to walk away from their damaged property because the damage is too extensive. There have already been instances when a homeowner would choose to use their insurance payment to pay off any remaining loan and then walk away. This sort of data could be the catalyst for a community renovation, funding or what has tragically happened, insurance leaving the area. To understand the data a little better, CoreLogic defines “extreme risk” properties as those having a climate risk score of greater than or equal to 70 out of 100 in any time horizon, or as having a shift in climate risk score between any two time horizons of greater than or equal to 40. Top metrics discussed here include all risks together, but are defined for each peril as well, and exceeding the limit for any one of them defines the property as extreme. The company also uses the term “grave danger” to highlight the magnitude of properties and dollars concentrated in these geographies when compared to the majority of other geographies in the U.S., but has not yet refined their criteria as detailed as “extreme risk.” The data also can be represented over different time horizons to capture a future spike, such as a flood in an area currently suffering a long period of drought, which again could be a catalyst for a community retrofit project. In CoreLogic’s analysis of all markets across the U.S. of extreme risk properties, the reconstruction cost or the dollars needed to rebuild the home in a total loss event, and the total home values or what the home would sell for today, it reports a total of 18 million properties valued at $8 trillion with California, Florida and Texas each carrying between 2.5 and 3.8 million homes. The value at risk in the Miami area is the highest in the country and so are the property counts. Of all the extreme risk properties in the country, about 12% of the units and the value reside in Miami today at 1 million homes with $$814 billion in value, and that risk remains strong over time. The San Francisco area has a slightly lower share of extreme risk houses, but the properties are valued higher on a per house basis, with half a million homes with $600 billion in value at risk. The same goes for San Jose, with 333,000 homes valued at $450 billion and Los Angeles with 383,000 homes valued at $356 billion. Texas is experiencing the opposite phenomenon with a higher percentage of homes at risk, but that are valued lower. So, the highest value of destruction is in the three California cities and the highest population impacted would be in the Dallas and Houston areas. With no mitigation to increase property resiliency with increases in climate risk, a risk score will change from 15 to 54 out of 100 by 2050. Nearly 300,000 model runs of impacts are replicated on the property to project average loss rate in a single year. Risk scores provide a normalized method to easily compare risk across geographies and time without having to do all the math, and an additional score is used to calculate dollars of loss based on the exposure, which is the reconstruction cost. The Failing Role of Building Codes This overhead view of two adjacent properties shows how a fence can act like a wick leading wildfire ... [+] straight to a structure. While building codes are in place for a very good reason, the development of the codes and the management of the codes come with many challenges. Ian Giammanco serves as the managing director of standard and data analytics and lead research at the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety and explains that building codes can be adopted and enforced at a number of levels, with state-level building codes standing out as the only to be uniformly enforced. Local and county codes become a bit more haphazard in their enforcement. “We advocate for statewide code because it is uniformly enforced and it is easier for all,” he said. He provides a strong example. In Florida in 1992, there were many variants of building codes at state, county and city levels, causing conflicts and misunderstanding, so the enforcement was not as strong as it should have been. Those disparities had devastating consequences when the strongest hurricane in Florida’s history hit in 1992 when Hurricane Andrew hit, resulting in the most deaths and the highest dollar of destruction in history. “Codes are there for the communities of tomorrow, so they need to be in place before we build,” Giammanco said. “Every three years code gets updated. They need to be updated regularly so that the latest engineering and science is in there.” As hurricanes continue to batter homes in Florida, the building code improves and now it usually is ranked as first or second in terms of effectiveness nationwide. “Following Hurricane Ian in 2022, we looked at 3,600 homes, 455 of which were built under the modern Florida Building Code, and none had structural damage,” he said. “It shows that the work that is being done is valuable and powerful.” In other extreme events, like wildfires, building codes have a long way to go. “Wildfires hit from the outside in and building codes usually deal with fires that ignite inside a property,” he said. “Only two states, California and Utah, have a wildfire-centric code in place today that is effective to protect outside in.” With the age of today’s housing stock, retrofits and renovations will be critical to protect residents from future events. The building codes for these remodels is harder to manage and to inspire participation with because homeowners have to commit to the upfront costs. A good example of this is the FORTIFIED program that has three levels and roof replacement is one of them. When a homeowner elects to reroof their home, it provides a good opportunity to do something stronger or better. Giammanco has seen successful incentive programs that will cover the cost differential or a claim to cover the added cost to go to a FORTIFIED roof so that the homeowner isn’t responsible for the extra expense, but gets better protection. Insurance Impacts This home was built to the FORTIFIED standard, a voluntary beyond-code construction method that ... [+] strengthens areas of buildings typically vulnerable to high winds and heavy rain. The CoreLogic data consists of 110,000,000 single family residences and, unfortunately, there is no industry-wide accessibility to which properties have insurance that would lead to smarter, safer communities. “We actually could get at analytics if there was industry-wide information on name of the insurer and the coverage A amount on the actual policy,” Srinivasan said. “That would go a long way in identifying under insured gaps. With the vast amount of loans being government backed, it’s surprising there isn’t easily accessible data on it.” Having that knowledge would completely transform this space that is incredibly difficult to manage currently with such little transparency. One means to help today would be to develop more precision in how loss is predicted so that the insurance companies can make appropriate offerings. “The private insurance market is what people really need to get the options for the best price and we have to maintain that,” Giammanco said. “With the changing landscape because of climate, we have to make structures stronger. Insurers are going to look at new products – like parametric insurance that is already in commercial space and might move into residential where the event severity triggers the right coverage.” To help solve these equations, there is a need for better building envelope materials along with better test standards to improve those materials. Then, those materials have to be deployed in the market at a reasonable price to scale up. For instance, composite materials are good at preventing hail damage but are still too expensive. In the case of fire, it’s more complicated and relies on a system where insuring individual homes doesn’t solve for the challenge. “Why fire is so scary is that in suburban neighborhoods, the codes didn’t account for it,” he said. “The neighborhood issue is hard because if two homes are close together and one is perfect but has one weakness it can be exploited because the neighbor did no mitigation. For us to tackle fire we have to do it at large scale – neighborhood, community scale to drive it.” Alabama and Louisiana recently implemented a very successful retrofit grant campaign to bring homes up to code and prevent future damage. The states joke that their grants sell out faster than Taylor Swift concert tickets. After the 2005 hurricane season, Alabama acknowledged it had to do something to maintain a good private insurance space. Launching the Smart Home Alabama program to drive consumer demand to set a benchmark of the minimum that you could do to build to the FORTIFIED standard. Growth started to kick in as builders caught on and local jurisdictions got involved. The grants got more funding and individual insurance carried beyond. “Almost a quarter of all homes in those counties are now built to that standard,” he said. “More than 45,000 homes in those two counties have the designation of being FORTIFIED. It wasn’t just insurance, it was incentives. Grants are like pressing a button for awareness.” Developing New Defenses Across the pond, William Swan and his team at Energy House 2.0 have developed one of the world’s most sophisticated testing centers that help manufacturers and industry players understand climate impacts on a variety of scales. “We need to build a new product,” he said about today’s housing. “The product previously built has been built for many, many years and there are issues around financing, insurance, between builders and energy providers. The business models are changing, so all the underlying institutional frameworks have to adjust.” Snow covers the ground of a testing chamber at the University of Salford's Energy House 2.0 testing ... [+] center. At the Energy House there are testing chambers where the team can construct a whole building, giving a holistic picture of the inputs, while also reducing the length and the expense of field trials. Wind, snow and solar can be measured in the chamber showing impacts on temperature, and the relative humidity. “At the lab, you can compress the time to undertake research by controlling the weather and by doing repeated experiments,” Swan said. “There are more data to see why things worked, not just if they worked, which is difficult in the field. We also could change the house as needed, energy systems, boilers, different ways to control, EVs, renewables and how all these things interact and even down to what difference does carpet make to energy efficiency.” Swan says the testing is all about the future. For example, Energy House is working with the homebuilders Bellway and Barratt to test the product they will be offering in 2025. “The demands on the performance of those buildings is much higher,” he said. “They have been building the same thing for 50 years, but future home standards means that they cannot use gas and the standards for building are much higher, which may be difficult to scale using traditional building methods.” The future also means issues that aren’t prevalent today, like overheating and making homes very water efficient to deal with droughts. The new extremes with hurricane force winds are very difficult but can be tested in the chambers, along with flooding by building a concrete base around the house and filling it with water. “When the homes are built, we put sensors in the walls, and each home has nearly $50,000 of sensors so every circuit or element can be monitored,” he said. The sensors provide data that is then collected and analyzed. Then, Energy House distributes the new knowledge to the industry at large to inform regulatory standards groups and policy bodies. Providing the research and doing the science is in the lab’s expert hands but leaves a fundamental responsibility to the builders. “As much as we are doing the science, the builders need to tell a story that the consumers can understand and make as usable as possible,” Swan said. Innovation is gaining ground, with homes such as this cantilevered design that can survive floodplains – a great story for a home buyer. Here are three other housing innovations that stand up to the most aggressive hurricane forces. As the future data predicts, we need to be prepared – with smarter products, systems, and programs. Game on."

KETI BANDAR, Pakistan — Wildlife ranger Mohammad Jamali boats through mangrove forests of the Indus River Delta, the terminus of a curly waterway that begins thousands of miles upstream in the Himalayas. Birds flutter in and out. Insects dart around mangrove roots that poke like fingers out of the mud. It looks ancient, but this part of the forest is only 5 years old. ""We planted this,"" says Jamali, 28-years-old. We — rangers of the wildlife department of the government of the southern Pakistani province of Sindh, and locals of nearby fishing communities. This forest in southern Pakistan is part of one of the world's largest mangrove restoration projects, covering much of the vast delta, an area nearly the size of Rhode Island. These trees, which exist in slivers between sea and land, are powerhouses of sucking up the carbon dioxide that is dangerously heating up the planet. ""They do this very big job per hectare,"" saysCatherine Lovelock, an expert on coastal ecology. Mangroves capture, or sequester, carbon dioxide ""through their roots and into the soil, as well as above ground,"" she says. This mangrove reforestation effort alone in the Indus Delta is expected to absorb anestimated 142 milliontons of carbon dioxide over the next sixty years. It's a test case for restoration, and planting mangroves at this scale might help the fight to curb planetary warming.

The area was hit hard, because the mangrove forests that once fringed this area had died away over the decades after successive Pakistani governments built dams upstream that deprived the delta of fresh water. The mangroves were a buffer between the sea and local communities,muting the impact of storm surges during cyclones and heavy storms. According toAfia Salam, an environmental campaigner, it was a former Sindh wildlife ranger,Tahir Qureshi, who pioneered planting mangrove species that don't need so much fresh water, because there's so little of it now in the Indus River Delta. Qureshi died in 2020 after a lifetime of advocacy for mangroves, and on behalf of the impoverished fishing communities that rely on them to attract aquatic life. Salam recalls fisherfolk called him ""baba,"" or father, ""because they respected what he was doing,"" she says, ""how he was benefiting the communities."" Qureshi oversaw the forestation of some30,000 hectaresof mangrove forest over the decades. But planting efforts were supercharged after a Pakistani company,Delta Blue Carbon, partnered with the provincial government to restore more than a hundred thousand hectares of degraded forests, and to plant an area more than double that with new mangroves. Jamali, the wildlife ranger, jumps out of the boat to show how they are expanding mangrove forests. From a mangrove tree, he snaps off a thing that looks like a spear. It's apropagule, basically, an already germinated seed that drops from the mother tree and lodges into the muddy, wet soil below. Wildlife ranger Mohammad Jamali heads into the nearby shallow waters of a mangrove forest, planted just five years ago, to show how workers are harvesting baby mangrove trees to replant elsewhere. Tree by tree, they are expanding this forest to encompass the entire Indus River Delta, and when completed, will cover an area nearly the size of Rhode Island.Diaa Hadid/NPRhide caption Workers harvest the propagules and raise them in nurseries on the forest outskirts. When they're hardy enough, the workers plant them elsewhere. That scale of reforestation takes years, and has so far cost millions – far more than the provincial government was willing, or even able, to spend on its own. The company Delta Blue Carbon has chiefly funded these efforts, spending years preparing this project, making agreements with local communities and the government. The company undertook this project so it could sell the mangrove's carbon dioxide removal service as creditsto polluting companies. Delta Blue Carbon representatives declined to respond to a detailed list of questions. The way carbon credits work is if a companyemitsa ton of planet-heating carbon dioxide, it can pay another company to do some activity thatabsorbsa ton of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide can be absorbed and stored many ways, including by planting forests, restoring wetlands and in this part of Pakistan, planting mangroves. Delta Blue's carbon credit program works by planting mangroves that suck up and store carbon dioxide and then it sells credits for that activity. This is big business in a world where companies are trying to show they are compensating for the carbon dioxide they are emitting, also called becoming ""carbon neutral"". In Pakistan, some environmentalists say without carbon credits, this massive reforestation project wouldn't have happened. They say the government was incentivized to support it. Instead of having to find the budget to do this, the government is being paid proceeds from carbon credit sales. So far,Delta Blue Carbonhas soldtwobatches of credits,most recentlyin June. It's made the provincial government around$40 millionso far, according to local media outlet Arab News. It's big money in a poor country. ""It is paying money. It is generating revenue,"" says ecologistRafiul Haqwho consulted on the mangrove project. Haq says without that revenue stream, the government would be under pressure to let developers in, for shrimp farms or for seaside homes. Haq says there's another benefit: auditors must evaluate the company's progress before they can sell more carbon credits, which means the mangrove forests are nurtured and protected, and the company has to show local communities are benefiting. ""This is a blessing for us,"" Haq says. ""We have to present ourselves as the good boy,"" he laughs. A woman walks past lines of men waiting for donations of food from a charity in the fishing village of Keti Bandar, at the mouth of the Indus River Delta in southern Pakistan. Poverty here is still widespread although fishermen say their lives have been improving since mangrove reforestation efforts began here in earnest a few years ago.Diaa Hadid/NPRhide caption To other environmentalists, the mangrove project is ""carbon colonialism."" ""I don't begrudge anyone, especially in areas like these, for taking money for large scale restoration projects like this,"" saysPolly Hemming, director of the climate and energy program of the progressive think tank, the Australia Institute. But she says, ""it's just another form of carbon colonialism. Like, we'll give you some money to restore your land,"" and then, sell ""your credits to a polluter so they can continue emitting."" Underscoring that argument, Hemming pointed to one of the key purchasers of these carbon credits is one of the world's largest fossil fuel trading companies,Trafigura. It is also one of the world's largest traders ofcarbon credits. Through a spokesperson, the company declined to comment for this story. In Keti Bandar, in a fishing hut near the jetty, 23-year-old Gul Zamir shakes freshly caught blue crabs into freezer boxes for market. He says crab, shrimp and fish have been returning in greater numbers as the mangroves have expanded. He calls them ""nurseries"" for sea life, and magnets that bring back catches. Fishermen gather their daily catch in a hut by the jetty in Keti Bandar, a fishing village at the mouth of the Indus River Delta in southern Pakistan. Fishermen here say their catches of fish, shrimp and crabs have been improving since mangrove reforestation efforts began here in earnest.Diaa Hadid/NPRhide caption He says a few years ago his family could only eat one meal a day – rice and lentils, or fish that he caught. Now he says, they're eating three meals a day – ""beef, mutton, chicken,"" Zamir crows, and pats his belly. That's where he measures the difference."

The deer live only in the low-lying Florida Keys. They are considered federally endangered, with an estimated population of around 1,000.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption Millenia ago, when much of North America was covered in ice, a distant relative of a white-tailed deer grazed its way down a limestone ridge to the southeast edge of the continental U.S. Over time, as the ice melted and seas rose, the limestone ridge was reduced to a series of shrinking islands — or keys — off the South Florida coast. The deer, trapped and isolated from its mainland relatives, shrank too. Today, the Key deer — or toy deer, as it's sometimes called because of its dog-size stature — is the smallest deer species in North America. It is genetically unique and ridiculously cute. It is Bambi, incarnate. It is also, possibly, doomed. Credit: Ryan Kellman/NPR Rising seas created the Key deer. Rapidly rising seas, a symptom of human-caused climate change, are challenging its continued existence and raising tough questions for the people trying to keep the nation's more than 1,300 other threatened and endangered species alive. How do we save an endangered animal like the Key deer when ""we know, no matter what, we're going to lose its habitat in the future?"" asked Nikki Colangelo, endangered species manager for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's South Florida region. The Key deer was one of the first species protected under the Endangered Species Act. Like 99% of the other species that have gotten protection from the landmark law, the Key deer has avoided extinction because of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Now, however, rapidly rising seas, a symptom of human-caused climate change, challenge its continued existence.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption The Endangered Species Act, which turns 50 this year, tasks wildlife managers like Colangelo with stopping extinction, protecting imperiled species and recovering them to the point where they no longer need federal protection. ""Saving life on Earth,"" said Martha Williams, director of the U.S. ""That's what we're doing."" But in an era of rapid climate change, when entire ecosystems are being eroded by supercharged temperatures, wildfires, hurricanes and drought, what does ""saving"" a species even mean? What counts? Left: Key deer are illuminated by car lights on Big Pine Key. Right: Dusk settles over a sliver of the island in the horizon. Sea levels globally have risen 6 to 8 inches over the last century. In South Florida, officials are preparing for another 17 inches of sea-level rise by 2040.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption ""The Endangered Species Act is being tested by climate change, and sea-level rise in particular, in these low-lying island ecosystems,"" said Chris Bergh, Florida field program director for The Nature Conservancy. Ninety-percent of the Florida Keys' land mass sits 5 feet above sea level or below. The islands are home to 31 federally protected plants and animals, and some 80,000 people. Bergh, a Keys native and resident who has spent most of his life trying to protect the islands' threatened species, has watched as habitats have shrunk. Pine trees and freshwater-dependent plants and animals have moved ""upward and inland,"" he said. But ""sobering"" sea-level rise projections — feet of expected water — are forcing an almost existential crisis. Open pine forest with dense underbrush, the deer's preferred habitat, only exists where saltwater can't reach. Between development and sea-level rise, pine rockland has been reduced to only about 2% of the deer's historic range in South Florida.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption Assuming sea-level rise can't be stopped — and it can't in the immediate term, Bergh said — for the Key deer and other species that live only in unique, disappearing habitats, these are the options: Do nothing, and let a species go extinct. Pick up plants and animals and move them to new areas like higher ground where they risk becoming ""invasive species,"" Bergh said. Collect DNA. Store seeds. Biobank. Take plants to botanical gardens and animals to zoos. ""If you move the Key deer to a series of zoos like people have done with pandas and other endangered species, you can do that and keep them going, but at what cost and to what end?"" Bergh asked. ""Is that really a future for the species?"" Chris Bergh looks out over what used to be Key deer habitat, now impacted by rising seas. ""As we look out here you see dead pine trees. And those tall, dead, gray stumps — or snags, I guess you'd call them — they show you where the pine forests used to be. And that's receded by, you know, hundreds of meters at this point,"" Bergh says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption There are an estimated 8 million plant and animal specieson the planet. At least a million of them are at risk of extinction —many within decades— because of human actions. Climate change is already directly threatening more than10,000 species, but plants and animals that live in only one unique location — endemic species such as the Key deer — are ""consistently more adversely impacted,""a recent studyfound. That's particularly true for island-based species. Geographic isolation, which makes islandscradles of evolutionand home to roughly 20% of the Earth's biodiversity, has a downside. Isolation also makes island species disproportionately vulnerable to shifts in their environment such as habitat loss, overexploitation, invasive species and climate change. ""We know even in the best case scenario for sea-level rise, we're going to lose habitat for all of these species,"" said Colangelo, standing on the back of a boat off the north mangrove-lined shore of Big Pine Key. ""Climate change is happening to all of us, it's just really easy to see on these tiny, low-lying islands,"" says Christian Eggleston, with the Florida Keys National Wildlife Refuge Complex. ""Roads are underwater, different things are eroding away, and we're watching islands disappear.""Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption The highest natural point on Big Pine Key, the main habitat for the Key deer, is 8 feet above sea level. From the water, the islands around it look like coasters on a roiling aqua countertop. ""Climate change is happening to all of us, it's just really easy to see on these tiny, low-lying islands,"" said Christian Eggleston, with the Florida Keys National Wildlife Refuge Complex. ""Roads are underwater, different things are eroding away, and we're watching islands disappear."" Sea levels globally have risen6 to 8 inchesover the last century. In South Florida, officials are preparing foranother 17 inchesof sea-level rise by 2040. An analysis by the The Nature Conservancy and Florida International University found that 5 feet of sea-level rise around the Keys would put$27 billionin property and 56,000 people at risk of inundation. Knowing how much habitat will be lost, Colangelo said it's unlikely wildlife managers will be able to recover species in the places where they currently are. ""That's why we need to be considering some of these other strategies,"" she said. ""Those are difficult conversations as an agency. Politically, socially, what kind of support are we going to get for, let's just say, translocating [picking up and moving] deer to different places?"" The tragedy of the Key deer is that if not for climate change, the species is a conservation success story. As recently as the 1950s, after decades of poaching and habitat loss, there were only about two dozen Key deer left on the planet.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption A 2011 study by researchers at Florida International University and the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in South Florida looked at the conservation options for two animal and plant species in the Florida Keys in the face of a ""perhaps no-analog future."" Conserving species in a changing world,its authors wrote, ""will require a new dialogue that includes controversial ideas, a review of existing laws and policies, and preparation for the oncoming change."" ""That paper was written in 2011 and there's nothing further that's been done,"" said Mike Ross, an ecologist at Florida International University who co-authored the study. ""It's just at an impasse. Meanwhile, sea levels are coming up at, now, almost a centimeter a year."" Nova Silvy, a retired biologist with Texas A&M University, was one of the first to study Key deer. ""It's not that the deer are endangered anymore,"" Silvy says. ""The habitat is endangered.""Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption The tragedy of the Key deer is that if not for climate change, the species is a conservation success story. As recently as the 1950s, after decades of poaching and habitat loss, there were only about two dozen Key deer left on the planet. ""We nearly lost them,"" said Nova Silvy, a retired biologist with Texas A&M University who was one of the first to study Key deer. A collection of conservationists, including the Boone and Crockett Club, realizing the urgency of the situation, stepped in. They bought land for the deer to live on and they paid for a game warden to protect them. That game warden, Jack Watson, a close friend of Silvy's, became a local legend, known forwaiting out poachersin swamps and shooting holes in the carburetors of their cars. In 1957, the National Key Deer Refuge became one of the first wildlife refuges in the country. Credit: Internet Archive In 1973, a U.S. President's Advisory Committee panel warned that the greenhouse effect was a matter of ""real concern."" Congress overwhelmingly passed the Endangered Species Act, a landmark law aimed at protecting critically threatened species from extinction. ""Nothing is more priceless and more worthy of preservation than the rich array of animal life with which our country has been blessed,"" said Republican President Richard Nixon at the signing. The Key deer was one of the first species to be listed as endangered in the U.S. — alongside others like the California condor, bald eagle, grizzly bear and American alligator. The protections worked. Ninety-nine percent of the species that have gotten federal protections from the Endangered Species Act still exist today. The Key deer's population soared. Today, there are an estimated 1,000 Key deer — so many that on Big Pine Key residents give them names and put up fencing around their gardens to keep their plants safe. ""It's not that the deer are endangered anymore,"" said Silvy. ""The habitat is endangered."" Roads on Big Pine Key are marked with ""deer crossing"" signs to try to prevent collisions with cars.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption Deer, like humans, prefer high ground. The deer's preferred habitat — open expanses of pine dotted forest called pine rockland — only exists where saltwater can't reach. Between development and sea-level rise, pine rockland has been reduced to only about 2% of its historic range on South Florida's urbanized tip. Deer, also like people, require fresh water. As sea levels rise and hurricanes get more intense, natural freshwater resources are shrinking or becoming brackish. Some residents on Big Pine Key now put out buckets or troughs of water for their neighborhood herds. ""People love them,"" said Roel Lopez, director of the Natural Resources Institute at Texas A&M. ""It's a species that people can kind of connect to."" That, he said, is part of what makes some of the choices ahead, like moving deer to new habitats, so hard. ""Some have argued, and I could argue either point: Is a Key deer still a Key deer outside of its natural habitat?"" said Lopez, who has spent 30 years studying the deer. ""That's a great question. I don't know."" Valerie Preziosi founded the nonprofit conservation group Save Our Key Deer. As seen here, deer frequent her front yard. ""The Key deer is like an umbrella species that covers all of the lesser-known endangered species underneath them,"" she says.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption If love for Key deer was measured in wall space, Valerie Preziosi would be the clear winner. A retired nurse, Preziosi is founder and president of the nonprofit conservation group Save Our Key Deer and is also a photographer. Her home, on a narrow strip of land south of Big Pine Key, is filled with photos of resident deer. Fuzzy-antlered bucks. Dot-speckled does. ""The key deer is like an umbrella species that covers all of the lesser-known endangered species underneath them,"" she said as a herd grazed on her grass outside. Preziosi has heard all of the options for the Key deer: Let them go extinct, move them to the Bahamas or mainland Florida, where they could successfully breed with normal white-tailed deer, or put them in zoos. She's familiar with federal, state and nonprofit efforts to preserve and restore habitat. Anongoing projectby the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission aims to restore Big Pine Key's largest freshwater wetland. ""We are doing the best we can for as long as we can,"" Colangelo said. For Preziosi, the question of what to do in the long term comes down to ethics. ""This is not a natural event, this is human-caused,"" she said, of rapidly increasing sea-level rise. ""So we owe it to these deer to preserve them the best that we can. So if we need to translocate them to higher ground, we should do that."" The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has no active plans to move deer to new environments, but the agency's director, Martha Williams, said she'd like to ""not take any tools off the table."" ""We have always looked at the Endangered Species Act as creatively and flexibly as we can,"" she said, noting efforts the Biden administration has undertaken to expand potential habitats for threatened and endangered species. In July, the Department of Interior published a new rule allowing,for the first time, ""experimental populations"" of species to be introduced to places they haven't ""historically lived."" Climate change is significantly changing habitats for wildlife all over the world. Ocean temperatures are soaring, scorching coral reefs. Precipitation patterns are shifting. Hotter air temperatures are causing plants and animals to move to higher, cooler elevations and new latitudes, north and south. Off the shore of a slowly disappearing Big Pine Key, on the Gulf of Mexico's bathtub warm waters, Colangelo said she thinks it's well-past time wildlife managers and conservationists start ""considering other strategies that maybe we haven't considered before."" ""We can't stand back and do nothing,"" she said. ""Our mission is to conserve and protect fish, wildlife and plants. But where is society on that?"" Credit: Ryan Kellman/NPR"

The storm hit in the early hours of Monday and brought strong winds and heavy rain. Weather warnings were in place but have since been lifted by the Met Office. Warnings in the Republic of Ireland - including a rare red warning, the highest level - have also ended. In Northern Ireland, about 2,000 customers were without power, mainly in Craigavon, Newry and Downpatrick, according to electricity grid operator NIE Networks. Some areas were expected to experience up to 40mm (1.7in) of rainfall within a six-hour period. As of 09:00 GMT there had been 22mm (0.87in) at Glennane in County Armagh - the most in any single area. The fastest wind gust recorded in Northern Ireland by 09:00 was 73mph (113km/h) at Killowen in County Down. Some roads have been closed in Ballymena due to fallen trees and Stormont's Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said there were reports of a landslip on the A2 Coast Road in Glenarm, County Antrim. The A22 Killyleagh Road in Downpatrick was also closed at Quoile Bridge due to damage caused by the storm. The DfI said early examinations suggested a masonry parapet has been damaged by a vehicle and the road will remain closed until a full assessment is complete. Public transport provider Translink said there were delays on the bus and train network and the bus station in Lisburn had been closed. Some roads were flooded and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) shared a picture of a crash on the M1 near junction 14, adding that nobody had been injured. Newry, Mourne and Down District Council said many of its services were disrupted due to the amber warning in the area. Household bin collections are delayed and the district's five parks are closed until further notice. County Galway in the Republic of Ireland was one of the areas worst hit by Storm Debi, with severe flooding in some parts. Ronan Henningan, from Clarinbridge in the county, said that ""everything"" in the supermarket he owns would have to be replaced. He estimated that the cost of repairing the damage could be up to €1m (£871,9400). At 04:36 local time, a member of his staff rang him to say that water was getting into the shop. The employee called back six minutes later to say that the water was up to his chest. ""It moved everything - it moved ovens that are floor-to-ceiling ovens that had to be brought in on a big huge truck,"" Mr Henningan told the BBC's Evening Extra programme. ""It was so just so powerful it moved everything, it knocked down walls."" He said that his community was devastated and he called on the Irish government to offer financial help to those affected by the floods. Irish weather service Met Éireann said a gust of 115km/h (71mph) was recorded at a weather station in Athenry, County Galway, on Monday morning. Galway City Tribune editor Enda Cunningham said that while Galway city was calm by late-morning the clean-up would be extensive. ""There are 30 cars at Seapoint car park and Salthill car park and they're destroyed,"" he said. ""I have never heard the wind that woke me at 04:20 this morning - and I've lost count of how many storms I have covered."" About 34,000 homes and businesses in the Republic of Ireland are still without power after the strong winds. Network operator ESB said work to restore power would continue but some properties would remain without supply overnight. ""The main areas in which customers will remain without supply overnight include Athlone, Cavan, Drogheda, Dundalk, Longford, Mullingar and Tuam,"" said ESB.

The highest wind speed of 77mph was recorded at Aberdaron on the Llŷn Peninsula in Gwynedd. High winds were affecting roads with a lane closure and reduced speed limits in place in both directions on the M48 Severn Bridge and the A477 Cleddau Bridge in Pembrokeshire closed to high sided vehicles.

The soldiers have been forced to fight in so-called ""Storm Z assault detachments"" that have effectively become penal units, the UK's Ministry of Defensesaidon Monday in its latest daily intelligence update. ""One of the core drivers of poor Russian discipline and substance abuse likely remains the continued lack of opportunity for combat troops to rotate away from the front line,"" the UK intelligence group said. In its intelligence update, the UK's Ministry of Defense pointed to a recent report by independent Russian news outlet Verstka, which saidRussian soldiers were getting hard drugs delivered to their trenches in Ukraineto escape boredom. According toVerstka, up to 15% of Russian soldiers in Ukraine were using drugs, including amphetamines and cannabis, and the drugs were easy to get their hands on, even on the front lines. One unnamed soldier told the independent Russian outlet at the time: ""It's like in Las Vegas."" British intelligence said on Monday, ""These reports are credible and follow numerous reports since the invasion of a high rate of disciplinary incidents, crimes, and deaths related to alcohol abuse amongst the Russian force."" The units these drug-using soldiers fight in are mostly made up of convicts and are thrown onto the frontlines, according to analysts from the Institute for the Study of War. The analysts cited Russian military bloggers who reported the ""Storm-Z"" units were ""often destroyed after a few days of active operations and on average lose between 40-70 percent of their personnel."""

The storm hit in the early hours of Monday and brought strong winds and heavy rain. Weather warnings were in place but have since been lifted by the Met Office. Warnings in the Republic of Ireland - including a rare red warning, the highest level - have also ended. In Northern Ireland, about 2,000 customers were without power, mainly in Craigavon, Newry and Downpatrick, according to electricity grid operator NIE Networks. Some areas were expected to experience up to 40mm (1.7in) of rainfall within a six-hour period. As of 09:00 GMT there had been 22mm (0.87in) at Glennane in County Armagh - the most in any single area. The fastest wind gust recorded in Northern Ireland by 09:00 was 73mph (113km/h) at Killowen in County Down. Some roads have been closed in Ballymena due to fallen trees and Stormont's Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said there were reports of a landslip on the A2 Coast Road in Glenarm, County Antrim. The A22 Killyleagh Road in Downpatrick was also closed at Quoile Bridge due to damage caused by the storm. The DfI said early examinations suggested a masonry parapet has been damaged by a vehicle and the road will remain closed until a full assessment is complete. Public transport provider Translink said there were delays on the bus and train network and the bus station in Lisburn had been closed. Some roads were flooded and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) shared a picture of a crash on the M1 near junction 14, adding that nobody had been injured. Newry, Mourne and Down District Council said many of its services were disrupted due to the amber warning in the area. Household bin collections are delayed and the district's five parks are closed until further notice. County Galway in the Republic of Ireland was one of the areas worst hit by Storm Debi, with severe flooding in some parts. Ronan Henningan, from Clarinbridge in the county, said that ""everything"" in the supermarket he owns would have to be replaced. He estimated that the cost of repairing the damage could be up to €1m (£871,9400). At 04:36 local time, a member of his staff rang him to say that water was getting into the shop. The employee called back six minutes later to say that the water was up to his chest. ""It moved everything - it moved ovens that are floor-to-ceiling ovens that had to be brought in on a big huge truck,"" Mr Henningan told the BBC's Evening Extra programme. ""It was so just so powerful it moved everything, it knocked down walls."" He said that his community was devastated and he called on the Irish government to offer financial help to those affected by the floods. Irish weather service Met Éireann said a gust of 115km/h (71mph) was recorded at a weather station in Athenry, County Galway, on Monday morning. Galway City Tribune editor Enda Cunningham said that while Galway city was calm by late-morning the clean-up would be extensive. ""There are 30 cars at Seapoint car park and Salthill car park and they're destroyed,"" he said. ""I have never heard the wind that woke me at 04:20 this morning - and I've lost count of how many storms I have covered."" About 34,000 homes and businesses in the Republic of Ireland are still without power after the strong winds. Network operator ESB said work to restore power would continue but some properties would remain without supply overnight. ""The main areas in which customers will remain without supply overnight include Athlone, Cavan, Drogheda, Dundalk, Longford, Mullingar and Tuam,"" said ESB.

The Met Office said ""persistent"" rain across the areas could cause disruption to travel throughout the day, and potentially lead to flooding. Three people died in Scotland as high winds, torrential rain and severe flooding hit Angus, Perthshire and Aberdeenshire during Storm Babet last month. Brechin was one of the areas to suffer the most flooding devastation.

The Met Office has issued cautionary alerts for Northern Ireland , Wales , north-west England , and north-east Scotland , anticipating gusts reaching up to 80mph in exposed coastal areas and 65mph inland. This disturbing weather system has already resulted in power outages and disrupted travel in several areas, with specific regions bearing the brunt of its force. Northern Ireland experienced road closures and disruptions in public transport networks, leaving around 3,000 customers without power, predominantly in Craigavon, Newry, and Downpatrick. In Wales, gusts reaching up to 77mph pounded the coastal regions following a yellow weather warning issued across various areas. The storm's severity prompted an amber warning in Counties Armagh and Down in south-west Northern Ireland and continues in parts of north-west England, including Cumbria, Lancashire, and Merseyside, suggesting a potential risk to life and property. In addition, yellow weather warnings for wind include much of northern England and Wales, impacting cities like Manchester, Sheffield, Liverpool, Bangor, and St Davids. The storm's influence extends further with a yellow warning for rain in parts of north-east Scotland, previously battered by Storm Babet, causing evacuations from flooded homes. Origin of Storm Debi Storm Debi's origins trace back to the Republic of Ireland, where red weather warnings were initially in place, resulting in significant power loss in over 100,000 homes and businesses, with the number expected to rise. The stormy conditions are forecasted to heavily impact Irish Sea coasts, leading to potential damage to buildings and disruptions in travel, including ferry cancellations and delays. The Met Office emphasized the possibility of severe weather leading to flooding, causing danger to life and disruptions across various modes of transportation, including road, rail, air, and ferry services. The warnings also highlight potential risks such as mobile phone coverage disruptions, injuries from large waves and coastal material being thrown onto properties. Storm Debi is anticipated to move into the North Sea by Monday evening, following the wake of Storm Ciarán and Babet, which brought flooding and disruptions across the Channel Islands, southern England, and Lincolnshire. While experts note the likelihood of more intense rainfall and storms due to a warming atmosphere, the precise impact of climate change on these events remains a complex and ongoing analysis for scientists. The urgency for global emission reduction remains crucial to curbing further temperature rises and mitigating the frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events. FAQs How are storms created? Storms are created when a center of low pressure develops with a system of high pressure surrounding it. This combination of opposing forces can create winds and result in the formation of storm clouds such as cumulonimbus. Why was the UK storm called Debi? The storm was officially named by Met Eireann and this is the earliest in the season that a storm in alphabetical sequence beginning with the letter 'D' has ever hit the British Isles .

LATAM Airlines, the largest airline in South America, announced Saturday it was waiving its change fees for customers who wanted to extend their stay in Buenos Aires, Argentina, after Swift postponed her concert there originally set for Friday night to Sunday, due to bad weather. While the tweet from the airline did not specifically mention the rescheduling of the the concert as the reason for the change in policy, it did say it would waive a normal change fee for those who had planned to leave Argentina’s capital before the rescheduled Sunday night concert. “We know that your plans have changed, that’s why starting today we updated our flexibility policy so that those who had a flight scheduled from Buenos Aires on November 11 and 12,” said aTweetfrom the airline posted Saturday. “They will be able to make changes without fines or fare difference to fly until next Friday 11/17, depending on seat availability.” Swift herselftweetedthe change in concert plans on Friday, citing saftey issues posed by a storm there. “I love a rain show but I’m never going to endanger my fans or my fellow performers and crew,” she tweeted. “We’ve rescheduled tonight’s Buenos Aires show for Sunday due to the weather being so truly chaotic it would be unsafe to try and put on this concert. Good news is I get to stay in Argentina longer!!” As for US airlines, United said it does not charge change fees on international flights originating in the United States, including round-trip tickets. Delta, which partners with LATAM, said it uses “situational flexibility to support customer adjustments.”"

But no matter how well you’ve gotten ahead of your holiday plans, if you’re one of thealmost 50% of Americanswho say they’re traveling sometime between Thanksgiving weekend and January, there’s a good chance you could experience disruptions this winter season. Almost a quarter (24%)of flights out of US airports have faced delays so far this year,according to the US Department of Transportation—up from 19% in 2021. That means your flight has a more than 1 in 5 chance of not leaving on time. The winter storms and technology issues that snarled operations for Southwest Airlines Co. in December 2022 could easily affect a different carrier this season, says Mike Arnot, an airline industry analyst and spokesperson for aviation data company Cirium. Yet, US airlines are better prepared for operational challenges this season, experts at Cirium and travel-booking platform Hopper say. “Last holiday season, airlines were trying to run a lot of capacity to capture holiday demand, but they were stretched thin as it was challenging to get staffing,” says Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper, adding that those worker shortages have since been alleviated. Still, your best bet is to stay on your toes and use all the latest tools to confront potential disruptions. Consider that ride-sharing companies are likely to face peak demand during the holiday period. With bigger crowds on the road, travel time to reach the airport can also increase. Earlier this year, Uber Technologies Inc. opened up ride reservations for up to 90 days in advance, a bump from the usual 30-day window that’s available on Lyft. This ensures a driver will be assigned to get you to the airport on time, rather than leaving it to chance, and you get to lock in the indicated fare. Lyft is taking it one step further this holiday season. Starting on Nov. 9 you can expect an “on-time pickup promise” for reserved rides in most major markets. This guarantees the driver will arrive within 10 minutes of your chosen pickup time. If the driver fails to show up inside those 10 minutes, you’ll receive a $20 Lyft credit. That goes up to $50 if you’re not matched with a driver within 10 minutes after your scheduled pickup time. If you have to resort to using another service—say, a taxi or an Uber—Lyft says it will credit the user another $50, for a maximum payout of $100. Hopper is predicting that the following 10 US airports will have the greatest share of winter travel disruptions this year. The list is based on flight delay and cancellation data from the past three months, as well as the last two weeks of December 2022: basically an airport’s performance last holiday season plus its more recent track record. Here are the expected losers, in descending order. 10. Dallas Love Field (DAL) 9. Dallas Fort-Worth (DFW) 8. Baltimore (BWI) 7. Fort Lauderdale (FLL) 6. New York City (JFK) 5. Newark, New Jersey (EWR) 4. Chicago Midway (MDW) 3. Las Vegas (LAS) 2. Orlando (MCO) 1. Denver (DEN) Sunday, Nov. 26, will be the busiest travel day of the year in the US, according to Cirium, based on the number of passengers flying(almost 3.1 million) and flights scheduled (more than 22,00). Other days that Cirium sees as being especially busy during the holiday season: Dec. 21, 22, 28 and 29, and Jan. 2 and 7. Aside from showing up earlier than required and bringing a solid dose of patience, you could build in a buffer day, so any special events or celebratory days aren’t missed. If you’re driving to see family for Thanksgiving, know that peak traffic days that week are Tuesday and Wednesday, around 4 p.m. to 5 p.m., according to Google Maps data that examined traffic patterns in more than 20 major cities across the US during the same period last year. Your best bet, the company says, is to hit the road on Monday or Tuesday at 8 p.m. local time. If a flight delay strikes and you’re a relatively short distance from your final stop, plan for alternate ways to get there. Berlin-based premium-car-service companyBlacklane, for example, kicked off US city-to-city chauffeured routes in May 2023. Rates start at $150 one-way, with a newly expanded route network that includes New York to Baltimore, Los Angeles to San Diego, Denver to Aspen and Dallas to Austin. Expect to cruise in a Cadillac Escalade, or a Mercedes-Benz E-Class or S-Class, among other similar luxury models. “We are increasing the distances that we serve in more and more cities, replacing things like short-haul flights, which are super uncomfortable, super unsustainable, full of stress and delays,” says Jens Wohltorf, chief executive officer and founder of Blacklane. You can prebook your city-to-city ride on the company’s app or online, down to an hour before pickup. If you should get stranded overnight with thousands of other travelers, resist the impulse to book at the nearest airport hotel, which tend to fill up quickly and may jack up prices when a massive storm sends swells of passengers into crisis mode all at once. A more pleasant solution is to book a hotel in the city—apps such as Hopper, Kayak or HotelTonight will highlight deals that most other stranded flyers won’t be snapping up. You’ll also save yourself the grief of standing in long check-in lines at the airport hotel. Finally, remember to purchase adequate travel insurance coverage. So far this year about 25% of all travel insurance claims have been for delays, says Steven Benna, marketing manager at Florida-based comparison-shopping siteSquaremouth, which is consistent with 2022. If you’re delayed at least three hours, most policy holders can expect to see an average payout of more than $485 for out-of-pocket expenses, with additional coverage for missed connections. Procrastination won’t pay off here: If a winter storm is announced a week before your journey begins and you’ve waited to purchase insurance, you can expect to be refused coverage when that storm disrupts your journey."

One example is Amazon’s new Fire TV Stick 4K Max , which came out just a couple of months ago and is now on sale for $39.99 ($20 off) at Amazon and Best Buy . The new flagship 4K streaming stick from Amazon is a lot like the last-gen model , but it packs better specs with Wi-Fi 6E support and 16GB of storage instead of 8GB while maintaining HDR support that includes HDR10 and HDR10 Plus. The last-gen model was one of our top recommendations for streaming devices, and the new model is just more of the same formula — a great streamer, especially if you want voice commands via Alexa. So if you want pretty much all the specs you can ask for in a stick-style streaming device that hides away behind your TV and comes with a good remote, the new Fire TV Stick 4K Max is a bargain right now. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max $ 40 $ 60 33 % off $ 40 $ 40 $ 60 33 % off Amazon’s latest streaming stick is faster than its predecessor with Wi-Fi 6E and double the storage.

Sharge’s transparent power banks are a great example of making a humdrum accessory more interesting-looking , and they’re now on sale for a new low price. You can get the Shargeek Storm 2 portable power bank for $159.99 ($69 off) or the more compact Shargeek Storm 2 Slim for $109.98 ($60 off) — both at Amazon when you click their respective on-page coupons. The Storm 2 is a beefy power bank that holds up to 25,600mAh / 93.5Wh of juice, has two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, and can output 100W of power to charge even larger laptops. The smaller Storm 2 Slim is no slouch, however, as it packs 20,000mAh / 72Wh of power with just one less output port. Both have handy color LCDs to show you battery and output levels, and frankly, both look smashing. There’s a small part of me that looks at the Storm 2 and feels strangely compelled to pick it up and put it to my ear like it’s a certain iconic phone . Shargeek 130 (aka Storm 2) $ 160 $ 229 30 % off $ 160 $ 160 $ 229 30 % off This 93.5Wh pack has 100W USB-C output, 100W USB-C input, a DC jack for input and output, and secondary USB-C and USB-A outputs that can run in tandem.

You still only get 100W USB-C output, though, and it charges slower at 65W. I prefer the larger one. $110 at Amazon A few more deals, both small and big: If the Fire TV Stick 4K Max deal above is more streaming device than you really need, the standard Fire TV Stick 4K for 2023 that Amazon released simultaneously is also selling for its lowest price. You can get the pared-down model (which has regular Wi-Fi 6) for just $24.99 ($15 off) at Amazon . Or, if you really don’t like the way Amazon pushes ads for its services on its streaming hardware, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K is also on sale for $29.98 ($20 off) at Amazon . Roku’s Stick is a fairly standard 4K TV streamer, but its software is one of the simplest to use — especially for someone who isn’t the most accustomed to living the streaming life. Looking for a big-ass OLED gaming monitor without plopping a TV on your desk or spending well over $1,000? LG’s 48-inch 48GQ900-B 4K OLED gaming monitor is on sale at Amazon for $699.99 ($800 off). Like the LG C2 OLED TV, it supports HDMI 2.1 with a 120Hz refresh and very fast response time, so it’s capable of playing speedy, twitch-response games even at its gargantuan size. It’s also got three HDMI ports and one DisplayPort, so it can be used for a computer as well as consoles.

Prisoner advocates say this allows forced prison labor, but systemic change has been met with resistance.Charlotte Gomez for NPRhide caption The U.S. Prisoner advocates say this allows forced prison labor, but systemic change has been met with resistance. After a few months working in his prison's hot and crowded kitchen, Richard Lilgerose noticed he was having trouble sleeping. ""I was always anxious about having to go to the kitchen and work under these conditions for hours upon hours and not knowing when I was going to be able to go back to my unit to get some rest,"" he told NPR in a call from prison. Lilgerose, who has been in prison for 20 years, suffers from PTSD, and says the chaos of the kitchen made it hard to work there. He kept asking for breaks, and eventually the guards stopped making him work. But Lilgerose says they also punished him, moving him to a unit with less access to the outdoors and to phones. He says he also lost ""good time,"" which can determine parole eligibility. What Lilgerose experienced is common in prisons nationwide. The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution abolished slavery, but it included an exception: Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist,it declares, except as punishment for a crime. Prison rights advocates say this exception allows for forced labor in prisons. The unexpected part of Lilgerose's story isn't so muchwhathe experienced, butwherehe experienced it. Lilgerose is in prison in Colorado, a state that changed its own constitution to say no one could be forced to work, not even prisoners. Five years ago this month, Colorado became the first state in modern U.S. history to enact this constitutional change. (Rhode Island banned slavery without exception in 1842.) Since then, there has been a growing movement across the U.S. to get rid of what's become known as the ""exception clause."" Nebraska, Utah, Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont have all changed their constitutions in the past three years. At least nine more have introduced legislation, including Nevada, where residentswill vote on this issue in 2024. But in Colorado, the daily lives of people behind bars haven't changed. ""Unfortunately, here we are five years later, and we have not seen the change happen inside of our prisons. It's been business as usual,"" says Kym Ray, a community organizer with Together Colorado, a multi-faith community organization. ""It was never intended to be a symbolic sort of thing, like we removed it from our constitution with no expectation of change. We actually did, in fact, expect there to be some level of change."" A spokesperson for Colorado's Department Of Corrections declined NPR's request for an interview and declined to comment, because of pending litigation. There aremore than a million peoplein state and federal prisons across the country. Most of them work, and three quarters say they're required to, according tothe most recent numbersfrom the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. ""The reality is that once people enter the prison gates, they lose the right to refuse to work,"" says Jennifer Turner, a human rights researcher at the ACLU and the lead author ona report released last year on prison labor. Most prison workers maintain the institutions where they're held. In New York, prisoners alsostaff DMV call centers. In Michigan, theymake license plates. In Louisiana, theyserve lawmakers food. In North Carolina, theywork on highway crews. In 14 statesincluding California, prisoners fight wildfires. In Texas,some prison farmsare located on the same land as former slave plantations. Coloradoused to sell goat cheeseto Whole Foods, though the company stopped amid public outcry. In 2020, the stategenerated more than $6 millionselling to around 100 private companies. Nationwide, prisoners oftenmake less than a dollar an hour, and courts have ruled that laws protecting workers outside of prison, likethe Fair Labor Standards Act, do not apply inside.

""They're stripped of every legal right, virtually, that workers outside of prisons and jails have,"" Turner says. Andrea Armstrong, a professor of law at Loyola University New Orleans, says penalties for refusing work can vary widely. ""You could get a disciplinary write-up and that might be what we think of as a ticket. Maybe you can't use the commissary service or maybe you can't have visitation for a week or two. And that's one end of the spectrum,"" she says. ""The other end of the spectrum is that you can be sent to solitary confinement and the time that you spend alone in a cell is 23 hours a day."" In 2018, Colorado's constitution went from this: ""There shall never be in this state either slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted."" To this: ""There shall never be in this state either slavery or involuntary servitude."" Full stop. ""When it passed, we celebrated, and I don't think it hit me until after the watch party,"" says Kamau Allen, who helped lead the effort and is a founding member of the Abolish Slavery National Network. ""I got in my car and I cried. I cried because I realized that we just made history."" Activists in other states began calling to learn more. Allen had high hopes until he started to hear from community members. ""A member of my church came up to me and said, 'You know, we're so happy that this passed. But my nephew, who is serving time right now, wants to know why, after this has passed, he's still forced to work against his will.' And that was one of the moments when the reality kicked in that this is a long, long process,"" Allen says. In fact, data obtained by NPR from the Colorado Department of Corrections indicates that more than 14,000 prisoners have been written up for failing to work since 2019, the year after the amendment passed. Hundreds of them were reprimanded, including being assigned more work or losing other privileges. Lilgerose, the man assigned to his prison's kitchen, and another prisonerfiled a lawsuitlast year, saying Colorado is violating its newly amended constitution. The state has argued the lawsuit should be dismissed and thattaking away privilegesis not the same as punishment. The case is now in discovery. ""It is really very simple. It's accountability. There is no accountability,"" says Abron Arrington, who was in prison in Colorado when the amendment passed. Hewas granted clemency in 2019. ""Legislators, if you're just like, 'OK, well we passed the bill, we've done our part. DOC can figure out how to do that and work that out.' DOC is not going to work it out."" In Colorado,skeptics of the changeto the state's constitution worried mostly that court-mandated community service and other work programs could inadvertently be affected. Michael Gibson-Light, an assistant professor of sociology and criminology at the University of Denver, thinks there's another reason why prison labor is difficult to dismantle. Much of the work of prison maintenance — cooking, cleaning, laundry, grounds keeping — is done by the people being held there, for little and sometimes no pay. A corrections officer watches as prisoners work in the kitchen at the Ellsworth Correctional Facility in Ellsworth, Kan., in December 2015.Charlie Riedel/APhide caption A corrections officer watches as prisoners work in the kitchen at the Ellsworth Correctional Facility in Ellsworth, Kan., in December 2015. ""If that flow of cheap or free labor were to stop, I think the fear is that the entire institution would possibly need to shut down,"" Gibson-Light says. ""It's not an unrealistic fear because speaking to the inertia of this whole system, this has been the way that we've manned these facilities for generations. And so to suddenly stop, it would be a budgetary nightmare."" Prison workers produce at least $11 billion a year in goods and services across the country, according to the ACLU report. That labor offsets the cost of the prison system. Some government officials in states like Florida and California, where measures to ban slavery outright have been introduced, have made this argument. In Florida, a former county commissionertold The Florida Times-Union: ""There's no way we can take care of our facilities, our roads, our ditches, if we didn't have inmate labor. ... We could not tax our citizens enough to replace the value that the inmate labor contributes to our community."" In California, the state's Assembly Appropriations Committee noted in an analysis that if changing its constitution forced the state to pay prisoners minimum wage, itcould cost taxpayers billions of dollars per year. But Allen, the Colorado organizer, says the cost is more than just financial. ""It's also a human cost. We had this conversation back in the 1860s that, oh, abolishing slavery would be too costly for our economy,"" he says. ""I don't think anybody now would disagree that that was a price worth paying."" Armstrong, the Loyola professor, says these amendments are important, especially in terms of addressing the harm to human dignity that people suffer while incarcerated. ""It is no small matter to feel like you are a slave,"" she says. ""That being said, so much of the conversation around these amendments has also focused on the political realities of getting them passed and to do so, the ballot language itself has often reaffirmed the ability of a Department of Corrections to force someone to work.""

Armstrong pointed to Utah as an example: Voters thereremoved the exception clause, but the change also included a note that it ""does not apply to the otherwise lawful administration of the criminal justice system."" ""It's not clear to me that in any state where that amendment was adopted, that the Departments of Corrections actually said, 'Oh, OK, it's our understanding that we will not force anybody to work again,'"" she says. The conversation around constitutional amendments, she says, has to be accompanied by one about fair wages, training and worker protections inside prisons. ""[People in prison] are not looking for a future where they don't work. So many people I've talked to have talked about the value of work that they learned behind bars,"" Armstrong says. ""They want to do work that's meaningful and that they have a choice in. And that is not an extreme request."" In Colorado, the community organizers that led the original campaign are now regrouping. And other states are paying attention. In New York, for instance, organizers are exploring a different route toward the same goal: Advocating for a statute to be passed by the state legislature, rather than a constitutional amendment. They say this route will create change faster. ""We're trying to be very explicit in the corrections law about what the intent and purpose of this law is,"" says Brandon Holmes, an organizer at the New York Civil Liberties Union. ""We're not leaving room for interpretation."""

""But we cannot continue overdrafting the region's most important source of fresh water.""To do so, he said, risks a potential takeover bystate officials. That's because state law requires that local agencies bring groundwater aquifers into balanced levels of pumping and recharge.The amount of water currently flowing into the valley's underground basin is 7,650 acre-feet a year. Annual usage is about 28,000 acre-feet. Eight wells have gone dry in the past year, and about 800 are at risk, officials said.But this is no classic stop-the-overdraft battle.The Indian Wells Valley aquifer lies under a point in the eastern Sierra Nevada range landscape where the corners of San Bernardino, Kern and Inyo counties meet.In 2019, the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, which generates $36 million in state and local taxes and represents a large portion of the local economy, said its top concerns include encroachment on groundwater, suggesting that shortages of its sole source of potable water could force it to shut down and move away.""Without the base, there's no Ridgecrest,"" Lemieux said. ""We have to have more water.""Draining the aquifer would also sink Ridgecrest's hopes of a bustling future of new homes, restaurants, and businesses for the 5,900 scientists, engineers and contractors employed at China Lake, which is undergoing about $4 billion worth of upgrades prompted by the 6.4. 5.4 and 7.1 magnitude quakes that rocked the area in 2019.""I don't see Ridgecrest turning into the next Las Vegas or Victorville, but it could benefit from some additional development,"" said Carol Thomas-Keefer, general manager of the groundwater authority.""More importantly,"" she said, ""the pipeline is a solution to a chronic problem: Wells are going dry because folks are tapping the aquifer's supply offresh waterfaster than it is being returned to the basin naturally by rain and snowmelt off the Eastern Sierra Nevada range.""That kind of talk has prompted Searles Valley Minerals, in the community of Trona, and Mojave Pistachios, a tree nut company on the west side of Ridgecrest, to rise up in a fury, declaring the proposed pipeline is part of a groundwater sustainability plan that forces them to bear an allegedly unfair and illegal economic burden that threatens their continued existence.""It's a pipe dream—one so bizarre it's almost laughable,"" said Amy M. Steinfeld, an attorney representing Mojave Pistachios, whose 210,000 trees materialized like a green oasis about a decade ago across 1,600 acres of scorched desert.""They've completely ignored numerous alternatives that would meet their goals while substantially decreasing the financial costs and environmental impacts,"" she said.Tensions have already flared over an aquifer ""replenishment fee"" of $2,130 per acre-foot imposed on a select few users by the groundwater authority in 2021. That increased the water costs for Mojave Pistachios and Searles Valley Minerals by as much as $6 million per year.The China Lake base, one of the largest users of water in the valley, has federal reserve water rights that make it exempt from the replenishment fee and pipeline costs passed on to ratepayers.""This fee is like saying everyone has a right to drive a Lamborghini—if they can afford one,"" gruffed Joshua Nugent, a spokesman for Mojave Pistachios.Claiming that it deprives them of their water rights and could put them out of business, both Mojave Pistachios and Searles Minerals are defying an order to pay the fees or cease pumping. The water district in Indian Wells Valley is also being charged but is making its payment under protest.Their cases, which are being heard in Orange County Superior Court to avoid claims of bias, have the potential to be landmark litigation as new groundwater regulators throughout the state consider how best to implement the state Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014.The battle has spawned a good bit of anxiety in Trona, a withering town of 1,500 residents in a wind-swept bowl hugged by three rugged mountain ranges that relies on groundwater supplied by Searles Valley Minerals.Searles officials say the authority's decision to single it out with the hefty replenishment fee, along with proposed rate increases related to the pipeline, could push the company out of business after more than 140 years of operation, putting its 700 employees out of work and turning Trona into a historical footnote.""With no Searles, there's no Trona,"" said Regina Troglin, 35, a resident and freelance architectural designer.""Just because Ridgecrest wants to grow doesn't mean it has the right to kill off Trona,"" she said. ""If the authority and Ridgecrest were serious about sustaining groundwater, they'd be pushing for storm water recovery, greywater recycling systems, and lawn removals.""The pipeline plan has also sparked challenges from environmentalists and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.That's because it would cut a zigzag path from a starting point at the Antelope Valley-East Kern Water Agency feeder pipeline in California City through historical habitat for wildlife including mountain lions, state and federally threatened desert tortoises and state threatened Mojave ground squirrels, chubby rodents with big eyes that advocates like to say resemble ""happy little Buddhas.""A particular concern is hybridization with round-tailed squirrels, which use disturbed areas as population expansion opportunities and have been moving westward from the Barstow area.High on a bluff overlooking Indian Wells Valley, Ileene Anderson, a senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, gazed out over the bone-dry desert valley born of seismic upheavals, flash floods, drought and heat.""It'll be a tough fight, but we're not going away—there are a lot of unanswered questions regarding the pipeline's impacts on wildlife and plants,"" she said. ""We're not convinced that importation of water over long distances is even sustainable over the long term under climate change scenarios for California.""That debate took a surprising turn in August when tropical storm Hilary triggeredflash floodsthat washed out county roads in the proposed site of three booster pump stations necessary to pushwaterin the pipeline over the El Paso Mountains.But backers of the pipeline said flood risks go with the territory, especially in arid mountainous regions, and could be resolved through mitigation.""We'll just put the pipeline a little deeper in the ground,"" said Don Strand, Ridgecrest city manager.A more pressing question, he said, is whether proponents can secure funding for the controversial proposal.""If we can't afford the pipeline, we have a big problem,"" he said.2023 Los Angeles Times.

People have been urged to avoid alcohol and caffeine as the drinks could cause dehydration. The weather bureau says high temperatures are usual for October but are likely to become more frequent and severe because of climate change. Intense heatwaves also hit parts of North Africa, Europe, the US and Mexico in July. Experts say 2023 is likely to be the warmest year on record due to ongoing emissions of warming gases and El Niño weather events. In an advisory, Malawi's Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services said a ""prolonged period"" of hot and uncomfortable weather was expected to persist until Saturday. The projected maximum temperature in the southern Shire Valley is 44C and 40C in northern areas along Lake Malawi, it added. Malawi's chief meteorologist Yobu Kachiwanda told the BBC that a daily continuous rise in temperatures had culminated in a heatwave. ""The high temperatures are due to direct heat energy from the sun which is apparently overhead Malawi,"" Mr Kachiwanda said. The elderly, children and those with pre-existing health conditions are at risk of suffering serious health risks if exposed to extreme heat for a long period. ""Heat-related illnesses like heat exhaustion and heatstroke are a significant concern,"" the weather bureau said. Locals are advised to drink plenty of water throughout the day, even if they do not feel thirsty. They are also urged to wear light clothing, avoid intensive physical activities and use sunscreen to protect their skin from harmful sunlight. However, the high temperatures are essential to attract weather systems that generate the first rains in the country, the chief meteorologist said. Malawi is still recovering from a devastating tropical storm in March that killed more than 500 people. Tropical Storm Freddy saw mudslides sweep through neighbourhoods and bury people in mud. The storm also struck neighbouring Mozambique and Madagascar earlier that month, destroying scores of homes and triggering widespread floods. A study by World Weather Attribution group showed that global warming has exacerbated extreme weather in southern Africa."

The move is in response to a recent report that said the situation is expected to worsen until the next harvesting season in March 2024. According to the report by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, the number of people projected to face hunger this year in Malawi has increased to 4.4 million from 3.9 million last year. Charles Kalemba is the commissioner of the Department of Disaster Management Affairs in Malawi. He said the hunger response effort for this year would cost Malawi about $226 million. ""We were able to raise about $78 million that we are going to use as cash transfers and government will provide 165,000 metrics tons to cover the deficit,"" he said. Cyclone Freddy, which also hit Mozambique and Madagascar, killed hundreds of people and displaced more than 650,000 people. The cyclone washed away 179,000 hectares of crop fields in southern Malawi. Maurine Likoswe is a farmer whose maize field was washed away in Chilobwe Township in Blantyre. Likoswe said she is excited about the relief program but is hoping the assistance reaches all the beneficiaries. ""We are happy and eager to receive that donation, however we wish to call upon this government to do things differently from the way other governments have been doing. Because, sometimes what happens is the real beneficiaries are sometimes left out and people who do not deserve to receive the items end up receiving,"" said Likoswe. Kalemba said everything is in place to curb any form of corruption. ""We will not tolerate corruption. We will not tolerate theft, and we will not tolerate fraud. Just as we did last year, a number of councilors were arrested, a number of chiefs were arrested, and officers were arrested. We are going to arrest again anyone who tries to misdirect the aid that is going to the people who are vulnerable,"" he said. Kalemba said people in southern Malawi where Cyclone Freddy hit the hardest will receive the relief maize for six months. People in other districts will receive the maize for a period of between two and five months until the next harvesting season in March. ""Because of the intensity of hunger that we are noting, in different places we may have to push some councils that we were supposed to start in December or January to push them to start in November and see how we move,"" he said. In the meantime, Kalemba has advised people against selling the relief maize, saying those doing so will be arrested."

Thirty-nine people are now known to have died in Hurricane Otis. Hundreds of thousands of people remain without power and water. Otis made landfall on the Pacific coast on Wednesday, with winds reaching 165mph (266 km/h). It had intensified from a tropical storm into a category five hurricane - the most severe category - in just 12 hours. Acapulco was among the areas worst hit in Mexico, with 80% of the resort's hotels damaged and streets flooded. The death toll rose to 39 on Saturday - 29 men and 10 women, the government said, while at least 10 are missing. Videos have been uploaded to social media showing looting in hard-hit neighbourhoods as food and water supplies run increasingly low. The main road linking Acapulco to the rest of the country has only now been reopened, allowing the delivery of essential goods to the city. In the Renacimiento neighbourhood, residents have been left angered by the lack of aid.

It touched down near the popular Acapulco resort just after midnight on Wednesday (06:25 GMT), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Authorities have warned of a life-threatening storm surge and the possibility of landslides as heavy rain pelts the area. The storm has already begun to weaken as it moves inland. David Hall arrived at the Princess Mundo Imperial resort in Acapulco for a work conference hours before Otis made landfall. He told the BBC that the building had been damaged by the wind and rain. He said the hotel room windows buckled from the force of the winds and smashed, sucking items out of the room. Mr Hall, who is from the Mexican city of Colima, roughly 600km (372 miles) from Acapulco, said the building ""shivered"" as if an earthquake was happening. He and hundreds of other guests at the hotel have been hunkering down together while the worst of the hurricane passes. ""A lot of people are scared,"" said Mr Hall. A hurricane warning is in effect for a 350km-long stretch of coastline between the coastal towns of Zihuatanejo and Punta Maldonado in the state of Guerrero. Power outages have already been reported in Guerrero, according to Mexico's civil protection body. School classes across the state were cancelled in preparation for the storm's arrival. Unverified videos posted online show damage to a hospital in Acapulco and flooding outside the Copacabana hotel. Mexico's national water agency said that waves of up to 10 metres high (32ft) were expected on the coasts of Guerrero and in western Oaxaca state. Possible mudslides have also been forecast. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said there was ""material damage and blocked roads"" and that there were landslides on the highway to Acapulco. He said there were no reports of deaths but cautioned that authorities were struggling to get updates. ""The hurricane is still affecting the area and communications are completely down,"" he said. Officials said that it was difficult to gauge the extent of the damage in Acapulco, which has a population of around 780,000, given poor communications. The NHC also said that Otis was expected to produce up to 20in (51cm) of rainfall on Friday across Guerrero and western coastal areas of the neighbouring Oaxaca state. Scientists said the speed with which Otis intensified from a tropical storm into a category five hurricane - the highest level of storm - on Tuesday was rare. It broke the record for the fastest intensification rate over a 12-hour period in the Eastern Pacific, gaining 80mph in that time, according to meteorologist Philip Klotzbach. Parts of Mexico's Pacific coastline have already seen significant flooding earlier this month after Tropical Storm Max hit. Local media reported two deaths as a result of the storm in Guerrero.

The governor of Guerrero state, where Acapulco is located, said 45 bodies had been recovered so far and at least 47 were still unaccounted for. Acapulco was devastated by the hurricane, which hit the coast as a category 5 storm before weakening. The slow arrival of aid frustrated locals with some resorting to looting. ""We don't have water, we are left with nothing, the house is full of mud, everything is damaged,"" one woman told Reuters news agency on Monday, urging the government to send help. The government has sent soldiers and police to the city and its environs and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised to ""put Acapulco back on its feet"". But a group representing retailers called on authorities to further increase security as some of its members reported lootings. ""Nothing justifies these acts,"" the group said. ""It's important to guarantee that food, medicine and hygiene products get to their destination and aren't stolen by criminal groups, the retail association said. Governor of Guerrero Evelyn Salgado said that many of the roads which had been blocked by debris and fallen trees had been cleared, making the delivery of food easier. Electricity has also been restored to about two thirds of the city, according to the federal electricity commission. The speed with which Otis turned from a tropical storm into a hurricane of the highest category surprised forecasters and residents alike, meaning that many were not prepared for the impact of the storm."

Hurricane Lidia, a Category 4 strength storm, is expected to make landfall on Tuesday night… [+2331 chars]",Mexico,"A hurricane described as ""extremely dangerous"" has made landfall on Mexico's Pacific coast. Hurricane Lidia hit Mexico as a Category 4 storm, bringing wind speeds of up to 140mph (220km/h). But the storm has weakened after moving inland, with the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) downgrading it to Category 2 status. Authorities in the state of Nayarit said a man was killed when a tree fell on the van he was driving. Lidia made landfall by the small beach town of Las Penitas just before 18:00 local time (00:00 GMT). It hit as a Category 4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which goes up to five. By 21:00 (03:00 GMT), the NHC said Lidia was blowing maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) as it passed near the inland town of Mascota in Jalisco state. The centre said Lidia was moving east-northeast at 17 mph (28 km/h) and should weaken quickly as it moves over elevated terrain in west-central Mexico. ""Life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected along the path of the storm overnight,"" the NHC added, warning of dangerous water levels, flash flooding and swells on the Pacific coast. Ahead of the storm, Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced that 6,000 members of the armed forces had been deployed to help residents. ""I urge people living between Nayarit and Jalisco, especially in Bahia de Banderas, Puerto Vallarta and Tomatlan, to take precautions,"" he said on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, recommending people stay away from low-lying areas, rivers and slopes. In the seaside resort of Puerto Vallarta, residents took shelter from the storm, with shopkeepers boarding up windows and piling up sandbags in case of flooding. Earlier, the city's airport announced it was closing from 16:00 local time (22:00 GMT) until 08:00 on Wednesday. Parts of Mexico's Pacific coastline have already seen significant flooding this week after Tropical Storm Max hit. Local media reports that two people died as a result of the storm in the state of Guerrero. Hurricanes hit Mexico every year on both its Pacific and Atlantic coasts. The country's official hurricane season runs from May to November, with most storms developing between July and October. The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but scientists say that increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions."

Four more people have been reported missing, the security secretary said. Acapulco was among the areas worst hit with 80% of the resort's hotels damaged and streets flooded. The Mexican President travelled to the city by land and at one point had to get out of his car and walk as debris from a mudslide blocked the highway. ""The army is bringing machinery and we're going to try to reopen [the highway] as soon as possible,"" President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said.

She did not give any details about where or how they had died.

Videos showed guests sheltering in bathrooms and other areas without windows so they would not be injured by flying glass as windows were blown in by the wind. The facade of a shopping centre in Acapulco was also ripped off. More than 30% of the homes in the state of Guerrero lost power, plunging entire towns into darkness. And although the strength of the wind subsided relatively quickly as Otis moved inland, Mexico's meteorological service warned that torrential downpours were likely to drench Guerrero, while Michoacán, Mexico state, Morelos and Oaxaca should expect very heavy rain.

Tens of thousands of residents in damaged homes without electricity awaited help more than a day after Otis roared ashore in Acapulco. Federal Security Secretary Rosa Icela Rodríguez said there were 27 confirmed deaths and four disappearances. Rodríguez's comments at President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s morning news briefing were echoed minutes later by Guerrero state Gov. Evelyn Salgado. López Obrador said the destruction was so complete that not a single power line pole remained standing in the impact zone. Small farmers had their corn crops devastated by Otis' wind and pounding rain, he said. Restoring power to the area was a top priority, he said. “We regret the 27 dead,” López Obrador said. The president said Wednesday night he had been told the toll was 18, but it rose early Thursday. “That's what hurts the most,” he said of the deaths, noting material losses could be replaced. López Obrador shared details of only one death: He said one soldier was among the dead after a wall of his home collapsed on him. The early images and accounts were of extensive devastation, toppled trees and power lines lying in brown floodwaters that in some areas extended for miles. The resulting destruction delayed a comprehensive response by the government, which was still assessing the damage along the coast, and made residents desperate. Many of the once sleek beachfront hotels in Acapulco looked like toothless, shattered hulks after the Category 5 storm blew out hundreds — and possibly thousands — of windows. There seemed to be a widespread frustration with authorities. While some 10,000 military troops were deployed to the area, they lacked the tools to clean tons of mud and fallen trees from the streets. Hundreds of trucks from the government electricity company arrived in Acapulco early Wednesday, but seemed at a loss as to how to restore power, with downed electricity lines lying in feet of mud and water. Jakob Sauczuk was staying with a group of friends at a beachfront hotel when Otis hit. “We laid down on the floor, and some between beds,” Sauczuk said. “We prayed a lot.” One of his friends showed reporters photos of the windowless, shattered rooms in the hotel. It looked as if someone had put clothes, beds and furniture in a blender, leaving a shredded mass. Sauczuk complained that his group was given no warning, nor were offered safer shelter, by the hotel. Pablo Navarro, an auto parts worker who was lodged in temporary accommodations at a beach front hotel, thought he might die in his 13th story hotel room. “I took shelter in the bathroom, and thankfully the door held,” said Navarro. “But there were some room where the wind blew out the windows and the doors.” Navarro stood Wednesday outside a discount grocery and household goods store near the hotel zone, as hundreds of people wrestled everything from packs of hot dogs and toilet paper to flat screen TVs out of the muddy store, struggling to push loaded metal shopping carts onto the mud-choked streets outside. “This is out of control,"" he said.

She viewed what she took as a chance to help her family after she lost the tin roof of her home and her family’s important documents in the hurricane. “When is the government ever going to look after the common people?” she said. Inside one store, National Guard officers allowed looters to take perishable items like food, but made futile efforts to prevent people from taking appliances, even as people outside loaded refrigerators on top of taxis. It took nearly all day Wednesday for authorities to partially reopen the main highway connecting Acapulco to the state capital Chilpancingo andMexico City. The vital ground link allowed dozens of emergency vehicles, personnel and trucks carrying supplies to reach the battered port. Acapulco’s commercial and military airports were still too badly damaged to resume flights. Acapulco's Diamond Zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, looked to be mostly underwater in drone footage that Foro TV posted online Wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water. Large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. Dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. People wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other less-flooded streets soldiers shoveled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement. Wednesday night the city plunged into darkness. There was no phone service, but some people were able to use satellite phones loaned by the Red Cross to let family members know they were OK.

The main highway into Acapulco was blocked by landslides for most of Wednesday, complicating efforts to reach people and effectively cutting off the city from essential resources. By late Wednesday, the roadway had been cleared only for emergency vehicles, authorities announced. Flor Campos trudged for more than an hour through mud along a highway outside Acapulco on Wednesday morning before she peeled off her shoes, worried she'd lose them in the muck. The domestic worker from a small town in Guerrero was among dozens of families, women and children who clambered over tree trunks and other debris left by landslides in the mountainous terrain. It was a daunting escape, but people were desperate to get out. “We had been waiting since 3 in the morning to get out, so we decided to walk. It was more dangerous to stay.” Campos said. On Tuesday, Otis took many by surprise when it rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 as it tore along the coast.

Tammy was expected to strengthen slightly in upcoming days and then weaken, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. The storm was forecast to drop up to three inches (eight centimeters) of rain in the Virgin Islands and the northern Leeward Islands, with meteorologists warning of mudslides and isolated flash flooding.

Laura Velázquez, the head ofMexico's civil defense system, said one person died on the northern outskirts of Puerto Vallarta after being hit by a falling tree, and two others were injured elsewhere in the area. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday that Lidia’s winds were down to 35 mph as it dissipated about 145 miles (235 kilometers) north-northeast of the city of Guadalajara, Mexico’s second-largest city and the capital of the western state of Jalisco. Lidia made landfall on a sparsely populated peninsula and then moved inland south of Puerto Vallarta, still with winds of 105 mph (165 kph). Victor Hugo Romo, the head of the Jalisco state civil defense office, said several homes around the landfall area had their roofs blown off, and the Puerto Vallarta city government said about a dozen trees had been knocked down there. Trees were also downed in the neighboring state of Nayarit. National Hurricane Center said Lidia's eye appeared to have reached land near Las Penitas, near Cabo Corrientes, a sparsely populated peninsula. Lidia remained a powerful hurricane even after moving over land, with some highways briefly blocked in the region. The state had 23 shelters open, he said. The Puerto Vallarta city government said a few dozen people had gone to shelters there. In 2015, Hurricane Patricia, a Category 5 hurricane, also made landfall on the same sparsely-populated stretch of coastline between the resort of Puerto Vallarta and the major port of Manzanillo. Local authorities canceled classes in communities around the coast. The expected impact came one day after Tropical Storm Max hit the southern Pacific coast, hundreds of miles away, and then dissipated.

AsMexico’s military leaders on Friday listed the aid that was beginning to pour into the city – thousands of packages of basic necessities, water, medical personnel – most area residents had yet to see it. And while authorities had allowed residents to take what they needed from stores across the city, people in more rural areas on the outskirts of Acapulco said their homes were wrecked and they had no access to food or water. Otis roared ashore early Wednesday with winds of 165 mph (266 kph) devastating high-rise hotels and humble homes alike in the city of 1 million. It took the entire first day just to open the highway allowing authorities to reach Acapulco and two days to make it possible for planes to land. On Friday, throngs of desperate villagers from impoverished outlying hamlets like Metlapil lined one of the only two roads leading into the resort, waving signs and desperately holding out arms asking for water, milk, diapers and medicine. “If we don’t get aid into Metlapil and the other towns, we’re going to block the road,” said resident Esteban Domínguez Bacilio, 19. He explained that they were desperate “because trees fell on our houses, our children need to eat, we don’t have anything” and “no authority has come, nobody, nobody.” The communities consisted of clusters of a few dozen modest wood and tin-roofed homes set among coconut palms. Farther down the road, dozens of angry residents of the hamlet of Lucio Cabañas, on the outskirts of Acapulco, carried out the threat of blocking the road. They pushed past National Guard troops at a toll plaza and shoved traffic barriers across the remaining lanes into the city, holding up signs reading “we need aid.” “We have gone three days without water, food, electricity, without anything,” said protest leader Juan Andrés Guerrero. “We have been forgotten by everyone.” The residents briefly blocked all traffic, before National Guard officials convinced them to let cars and emergency vehicles through in exchange for a promise of aid. One motorist gunned a pickup through the roadblock scattering protesters, some of whom tossed rocks at the truck as it sped away. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has softly asked people to not take advantage of the situation by taking more than they need, promising help is on the way. Officials said they had established an “air bridge” between Mexico City and Acapulco. Medical personnel were flying into the commercial airport and stranded tourists were flying out. Flights into the local military air base carried 40 tons of aid that the military is in charge of distributing. The president, who has heaped a range of responsibilities on the military during his administration and who seems to trust few other government institutions and even less the private sector, stressed that all aid would flow through the government, not nongovernmental organizations. López Obrador said 1,000 government workers would begin a house-by-house census Friday to determine each family’s needs. Some 10,000 “packages” of appliances — refrigerators, stoves, mattresses — had already been collected by the government and were ready to distribute to families who need them, he said. “Everyone will be supported, count on us,” the president said."

At least 27 people have been killed after Hurricane Otis, one of the most powerful storms to ever hit Mexico, struck the Pacific beach resort of Acapulco. Otis, with winds of 270 kilometres per hour (165 miles per hour), ripped roofs from homes and hotels, tore trees from the ground, and largely cut off communications and road links with the region. Some hospitals were forced to evacuate patients amid flooding that inundated streets and left cars submerged in a trail of wreckage across the city of nearly 900,000 people. “What Acapulco suffered was really disastrous,” President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told a press conference in Mexico City on Thursday. Many of those killed were swept away in overflowing rivers, according to authorities. Four people remain missing. The government has not said how many were injured but has declared a state of emergency in the region. In a matter of hours, Otis intensified from a tropical storm to the most powerful category of the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale before hitting land, taking authorities by surprise. “It’s unprecedented in the country in recent times, not only because of the way it strengthened so quickly but also the magnitude of the hurricane,” Lopez Obrador said. The World Meteorological Organization described the hurricane as “one of the most rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones on record”. People in Acapulco recounted a terrifying ordeal as Otis made landfall overnight early on Wednesday. “The building shook as if there was an earthquake,” Citlali Portillo, a tourist accommodation manager, told the television channel Televisa, saying she had taken shelter in a bathtub. Erik Lozoya, a professional magician, said he endured “three hours of terror” with his wife and two baby daughters in an Acapulco hotel room as the hurricane smashed through the windows and swept through the building with deafening intensity. “It literally felt as though our ears were going to explode,” said the 26-year-old, who barricaded himself in a bathroom with his family and four others. “We saw mattresses, water tanks flying. The ceiling began to cave in.” Some residents slogged for hours through mud and debris in an attempt to find food and shelter. “Acapulco is a total disaster. It is not what it was before,” said 24-year-old Eric Hernandez. “The shops had all been looted, people were fighting for things. So we decided to walk as there wasn’t anything left there,” he said. Lopez Obrador travelled to Acapulco late on Wednesday by road, changing his vehicle more than once because of landslides and floods caused by the storm. One social media post showed him sitting in a military jeep stuck in mud. On Thursday afternoon, the government said the air traffic control tower of Acapulco’s international airport was up and running again and that an air bridge enabling tourists to reach Mexico City would be operating from Friday. Mexican authorities said Otis was the most powerful storm ever to strike Mexico’s Pacific coast. The defence ministry said nearly 8,400 members of Mexico’s army, air force and national guard had been deployed in and around Acapulco to assist in the cleanup. Acapulco is the biggest city in the southern state of Guerrero, one of the poorest in Mexico. The local economy depends heavily on tourism, and Otis caused extensive damage to some of the most famous hotels on the city’s coast. Calling the storm “totally devastating”, Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado said 80 percent of the city’s hotels had been hit by the storm and that authorities were working to restore electricity and reactivate drinking water pumps.

At least 27 people are dead and four missing in the destruction along Mexico's Pacific coast, with devastation that extends for miles.All this after Acapulco was told to expect a tropical storm just below hurricane strength. Just 24 hours later, Otis blasted ashore with 165 mph (266 kph) winds, the strongest landfall of any East Pacific hurricane.In just 12 hours, Otis' strength more than doubled from 70 mph (113 kph) winds to 160 mph (257 kph), also a record, as it neared the coast. And it got even stronger before it struck. Storms typically gain or lose a few miles per hour in 12 hours, though some outliers gain 30 to 50 mph (48 to 80 kph) in a day.What happened with Otis was just plain nuts, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. But it coincides with a documented trend ofhurricanes rapidly intensifying more often in recent decadesbecause of warmer water connected toclimate change, scientists said.Five different hurricane experts told The Associated Press they weren't quite sure what set Otis off and why it wasn't predicted, especially since meteorologists have been dramatically improving their intensity forecasts in recent years.""The models completely blew it,"" said MIT atmospheric sciences professor Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane expert.Experts point to lack of data on the storm and its surroundings and just not completely understanding what makes a storm act like it's on steroids.Trucks sit idle on a highway blocked by a landslide triggered by Hurricane Otis near Acapulco, Mexico, Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2023. The hurricane turned from mild to monster in record time, and scientists are struggling to figure out how — and why they didn't see it coming. Credit: AP Photo/Marco UgarteAnd it really matters because in Otis' case, the storm was coming ashore when it muscled up.""It's one thing to have a Category 5 hurricane make landfall somewhere when you're expecting it,"" McNoldy said. ""But to have it happen when you're not expecting anything to happen is truly a nightmare.""For example, McNoldy, who lives in Miami, said a tropical storm forecast would prompt him to ""do things like move some lightweight furniture in and take down wind chimes and things like that. That's about it. You're not preparing for a Category 5 hurricane.""National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said ""that's a very bad scenario, populated area, rapid intensification very close to landfall, a change in the expectations about the impacts that's happening on a time scale that doesn't give people a lot of time to respond.""Brennan said Otis' unforeseen buildup was because ""it found a much more favorable environment than we were anticipating."" He said one part was warm water, another was that the winds—moving in the right direction and at the right altitude—allowed a somewhat raggedy storm to rapidly develop structure and strengthen.McNoldy said there may be a mystery ingredient that scientists just don't know right now, but water is key.Warm water is fuel for hurricanes. Hot, deep water is like an all-you-can-eat buffet.Globally, the world's oceans have been setting monthly surface heat records since April. The surface waters off the Mexican coast were warm but ""not crazy warm,"" said University at Albany atmospheric scientist Kristen Corbosiero. Bennan and McNoldy said those waters were maybe 1 or 2 degrees above normal.Tourists swim in Acapulco, Mexico, Oct. 24, 2023. Hurricane Otis turned from mild to monster in record time, and scientists are struggling to figure out how — and why they didn't see it coming. Credit: AP Photo/Bernardino Hernandez, FileBelow that, the water was much hotter than usual ""and there's just a ton of fuel out there right now,"" McNoldy said. Still, the storm didn't linger and feed on that, which would be expected in rapid intensification, Brennan said.The heat content in the deeper ocean worldwide has been smashing records. It's from human-caused climate change, McNoldy and other scientists said, as the oceans act as a sponge to absorb a lot of the excess heat caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas.Otis and two other historically explosive cases of rapid intensification—Patricia in 2015 and Wilma in 2005—all happened in the same mid- to late-October time frame, when deeper water and ocean heat content is at its highest, McNoldy said.Numerous studies have shown globally that there aremore cases of rapid intensification of hurricanesthan there used to be. An official definition of rapid intensification is a gain in strength of 35 mph (56 kph) in 24 hours. Six storms in 2020 rapidly intensified, many of them just before smacking land. In 2017, two devastating hurricanes, Harvey and Maria, rapidly intensified. Last month in the Atlantic, Hurricane Lee rapidly intensified from 80 mph (129 kph) to 155 mph (249 kph), but didn't hit anywhere.""We're seeing so many more cases of these just astonishing rapid intensification events,"" said former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hurricane and climate scientist Jim Kossin, now with the First Street Foundation.Kossin said that there's evidence that what's happening globally over a longer time frame is due in part to human-caused climate change but it's hard to say that about an individual storm.But, he added, ""this is exactly the kind of thing we would expect to find as the climate warms.""MIT's Emanuel said it might be more than just the water's temperature, but its low salinity, too. Water in that area at this time of year is fresher from heavy rains at the surface, and that changes the mix of water temperature, he said. Normally a hurricane mixes the warm water on the surface with cooler water below. But when the surface water is fresher, a storm pulls up even more hot water from below, which feeds the storm more ""and before you know it, you're in hot water,"" Emanuel said.People get help crossing a highway blocked by a landslide triggered by Hurricane Otis near Acapulco, Mexico, Wednesday, Oct. Credit: AP Photo/Marco UgarteOne key test of that theory is whether Otis leaves warm water in its wake. Usually, hurricanes leave behind cold water. Emanuel hopes satellite images will show it, but it's not certain whether they'll get the right view.Another factor that Brennan and others mention is that perhaps forecasters underestimated Otis' original strength. That would mean it didn't intensify as much as it appears because it was stronger to begin with.""The East Pacific in a lot of ways is a huge data void,"" Brennan said. ""There's no buoys. There's very few land observations. There's no radars along the west coast of Mexico. So we're really reliant almost entirely on satellite imagery.""And sometimes satellites, looking at a storm from high above, cannot get an accurate picture of what's going on.Think of it like a jigsaw puzzle and forecasters at times have only 10% of the pieces, Brennan said.Forecasters have far more tools to see what's happening in Atlantic storms, he said.© 2023 The Associated Press.

Both storms were Category 1hurricanes when they hit. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Norma, once a Category 4 hurricane, moved ashore with winds of 80 mph (130 kph) near el Pozo de Cota, west-northwest of Cabo San Lucas. Norma later weakened to a tropical storm with 70 mph (110 kph) winds as it crossed the Baja California Peninsula and by late Saturday it was nearing the Sea of Cortez, also known as the Gulf of California. Businesses in Cabo San Lucas had nailed plywood over their windows, and government personnel hung banners warning people not to try to cross gullies and stream beds after Norma regained strength and again became a major storm Friday. Norma was centered about 45 miles (70 kilometers) north-northeast of Cabo San Lucas late Saturday, the National Hurricane Center said. It was moving north-northeast at 6 mph (9 kph), but was expected to take a harder turn toward the east Sunday. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said via the platform X that there had so been no reported loss of life from the storm. “Hurricane Norma already passed Los Cabos and there are only torrential rains in La Paz, but without loss of life.” In Cabo San Lucas, curious tourists began to pick their way along debris-strewn beaches after the storm passed. The effects of the storm were still being felt after night fell, and authorities urged people to stay at home. There were still families in shelters in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo, though officials did not say how many. Around 200 people were in shelters in La Paz. Its languid pace raised the possibility of severe flooding. Norma was expected to dump six to 12 inches of rain, with a maximum of 18 inches in places across southern Baja California and much of Sinaloa state. John Cangialosi, a senior specialist at the National Hurricane Center, said the area is vulnerable to rain because it is a dry region generally. ""Six to 12 inches of rain is what is generally forecast, but there could be pockets of up to 18 inches of rain and we do think that will be the most significant impact that could result in flash and urban flooding and mudslides,” he said. Baja California Sur Gov. Victor Castro said via the platform X that “because it's moving slowly, greater damages are anticipated.” But little damage was initially reported. Some trees and power poles were down, but there were no reports of injuries. Police in San Jose del Cabo rescued two people from their truck when a surging stream swept it away early Saturday. Some informal settlements, away from the hotels that serve tourists, were isolated by rising water. Some neighborhoods lost electricity and internet service. The federal government posted 500 marines to the resort to help with storm preparations. By late morning, the area's streets were littered with palm fronds and other debris, and essentially deserted except for occasional military patrols. Strong winds whipped traffic signs, trees and power lines. Hotels in Los Cabos, which are largely frequented by foreign tourists, remained about three-quarters full and visitors made no major moves to leave en masse, officials said. The local hotel association estimated about 30,000 tourists were in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo on Friday. Airports were closed. San Jose del Cabo airport director Francisco Villaseñor said he expected flights to resume by midday Sunday. National Hurricane Center said Tammy came ashore Saturday night with 85 mph (140 kph) winds. The hurricane was moving north-northwest at 10 mph (17 kph) and by late Saturday was centered 15 miles (25 kilometers) north-northwest of Barbuda. Hurricane warnings remained in effect for the islands of Barbuda, Anguilla, St. Martin and St. Barthelmy. The warning was lifted for Antigua. The hurricane center said that “heavy rainfall and flooding (are) likely over much of the Lesser Antilles.” Tammy hit two weeks after Tropical Storm Phillippe swept by Antigua and Barbuda dumping six to eight inches of rain and plunging both islands into darkness. The slow-moving system was forecast to bring up to 12 inches over a twin island nation, where the devastation of Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Philippe's recent wind damage and flooding were still fresh memories. “This means therefore, that the earth is still somewhat saturated and with additional rainfall, the potential for flooding is elevated,” Prime Minister Gaston Browne said in a nationwide broadcast Friday. He urged residents to take all necessary steps to secure life and property. Government offices, banks and most non-retail businesses closed early on Friday to allow staff to prepare. Residents’ rushed to stock up on necessities, causing gridlock throughout St John’s and near popular shopping centers and supermarkets. Local disaster management officials announced plans to open about 40 shelters in communities throughout the country. ___ Associated Press writer Anika Kentish in St. John's, Antigua, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s climate coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment"

The hurricane roared ashore with 165mph winds and torrential rainfall, slamming into the coastal city of Acapulco, Mexico, and claiming the lives ofat least 48 people.The speed at which Otis intensified was unprecedented. Within 12 hours it went from a regular tropical storm to a ""category 5"" hurricane, the most powerful category and one which might occur only a few times worldwide each year.This rare and alarming event, described by the US National Hurricane Center as a ""nightmare scenario"", broke records for the fastest intensification rate over a 12-hour period in the eastern Pacific. Otis not only caught residents and authorities off guard but also exposed the limitations of our current predictive tools.I specialize inthe study of natural disasterswith the goal of improving our ability to predict them and ultimately to save lives. It is critical that we address the pressing concerns related to the tools we use for forecasting thesecatastrophic events, all while recognizing the significant influence of rapid climate change on our forecasting capabilities.The predictive tools we rely onAt the core ofweatherforecasting are computer programs, or ""models,"" that blend atmospheric variables such as temperature, humidity, wind and pressure, withfundamental physics.Since the atmospheric processes are nonlinear, a small degree of uncertainty in initial atmospheric conditions can lead to a large discrepancy in final forecasts. That's why thegeneral practicenow is to forecast a set of possible scenarios rather than predict the single scenario most likely to occur.But while these models are instrumental in issuing early warnings and evacuation orders, they have fundamental limitations and carry a significant degree of uncertainty, especially when dealing with rare orextreme weather. This uncertainty arises from various factors including thefundamentally chaotic nature of the system.First, thehistorical datais incomplete, since a hurricane such as Otis might occur only once in several millennia. We don't know when an east Pacific storm last turned into a category 5hurricaneovernight—if ever—but it was certainly before modern satellites and weather buoys. Our models struggle to account for these ""one in 1,000-year events"" because we simply haven't observed them before.The complex physics governing the weather also has to be simplified in these predictive models. While this approach is effective for common scenarios, it falls short when dealing with the intricacies of extreme events that involve rare combinations of variables and factors.And then there are the unknown unknowns: factors our models cannot account for because we are unaware of them, or they have not been integrated into our predictive frameworks. Unanticipated interactions among various climatic drivers can lead to unprecedented intensification, as was the case with Hurricane Otis.The role of climate changeTo all this we can add the problem of climate change and its impact on extreme weather. Hurricanes, in particular, are influenced by risingsea surface temperatures, which provides more energy for storms to form and intensify.The connection between climate change and the intensification of hurricanes, coupled with other factors such as high precipitation or high tides, isbecoming clearer.With established weather patterns being altered, it is becoming even more challenging to predict the behavior of storms and their intensification. Historical data may no longer serve as a reliable guide.The way forwardThe challenges are formidable but not insurmountable. There are a few steps we can take to enhance our forecasting and better prepare for the uncertainties that lie ahead.The first would be to develop more advanced predictive models that integrate a broader range of factors and variables, as well as consider worst-case scenarios. Artificial intelligence and machine learning tools can help us process vast and complex datasets more efficiently.But to get this additional data we'll have to invest in more weather monitoring stations, satellite technology, AI tools and atmospheric and oceanographic research.Since even world experts and their models can be caught out by sudden weather extremes, we also need to educate the public about the limitations and uncertainties in weather forecasting.We must encourage preparedness and a proactive response to warnings, even when predictions seem uncertain. And of course we still have to mitigate climate change itself: the root cause of intensifying weather events.Hurricane Otis provided a stark and immediate reminder of the inadequacies of our current predictive tools in the face of rapid climate change and increasingly extreme weather events. The urgency to adapt and innovate in the realm of weather forecasting has never been greater.It is incumbent upon us to rise to the occasion and usher in a new era of prediction that can keep pace with the ever-shifting dynamics of our planet's climate. Our future depends on it."

[+] Acapulco, after hurricane Otis hit Acapulco on October 25, 2023 in Acapulco, Mexico. Otis made landfall through the coast of Acapulco around midnight of October 25 as a category 5 storm. President Lopez Obrador reported that communications were interrupted in the city, power lines were down affecting almost a million people, infrastructure is severely damaged and the roads to the port present important damages. (Photo by Luis Gutierrez/Norte Photo/Getty Images) My mouth dropped when I saw that a potential Category 5 hurricane was going to make landfall near Acapulco, Mexico. It is rare to see a hurricane of such extreme intensity directly impact a city with such a large population, and the outcome unfortunately was as expected. Nahel Belgherze posted on the platform X, “Acapulco, Mexico might have just become the first city of over a million inhabitants in the world to experience the eyewall of a Category 5 storm.” Images of the damage suggest that it will take years for the region to recover. Was it a forecast bust and what can we learn? There is no doubt that from an intensity perspective, Hurricane Otis far exceeded expectations. It exhibited rapid intensification, which is at least a gain of 35 mph of wind speed in less than 24 hours. In fact, Otis went from a Tropical Storm to a Category 5 hurricane in half of that time. This pace is what I have called hyper-intensification in recent storms. The models were way off so let’s go ahead and call it a bust. Even with such hyper-intensification, National Hurricane Center forecasters certainly had some perspective that explosive development was possible. Let’s review their forecast discussion from Tuesday, October 24th. Senior hurricane specialist Richard Pasch wrote, “Sea surface temperatures are very warm, around 30 deg C, and the low-to mid-level humidities are fairly high.” He also went on to note that there was only weak to moderate wind shear over the system, which is also a favorable condition for intensification. Pasch continued, “Steady strengthening seems likely until Otis makes landfall within the next day or so. Based on the current trends, the official intensity forecast is above most of the model guidance. The SHIPS Rapid Intensification (RI) indices show a greater than normal probability of RI, so some further upward adjustments to the intensity forecast are possible later today.” I have actually been impressed with how confidently NHC forecasters have been in mentioning rapid intesification. They certainly have plenty of practice in recent years. VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) sensor on the NOAA-20 satellite shows Hurricane ... [+] Otis at 08:30 Universal Time (2:30 a.m. in Acapulco) on October 24, 2023. After the storm, my former colleague and NASA research meteorologist Scott Braun said, “Conditions were present for rapid intensification, but it is hard to say at this time why the rate and magnitude of intensification were so great.” In the research community, Otis will be study for years to come. The models did not capture the level of intensification. Brian McNoldy is a hurricane expert at the University of Miami. His post below on the platform X is revealing. Hurricane specialist Eric Blake echoed this thought on the same thread. He wrote, “Every operational model missed it before the RI occurred and the EC was the best of the sad bunch, which is saying something because usually it has no intensity skill.” Though gains have been made, it has long been known that skill with hurricane track forecasts have outpaced intensity forecasts. I have written on this very topic previously in Forbes. Hurricane track is governed by larger scale atmospheric processes that can be sufficiently resolved in the models. Intensity changes are related to smaller scale features of the ocean heat content, wind shear, and energy exchanges within the eyewall structure. Many of these processes are often difficult to resolve in our models. A 2022 NOAA report argued, “Improving NOAA's hurricane intensity forecasts will require closing gaps in ocean and air-sea observations, as these data are key to better understanding the interaction processes that lead to the formation and intensification of storm systems.” Speaking of track, the forecasts certainly indicated that Acapulco would be dealing with some type of storm albeit a much weaker system. Forecasters knew that a tropical storm, at a minimul, would likely impact the region but as weather expert Tomer Burg remarks, it was certainly unexpected be a Category 5. We just do not expect this level of intensity in East Pacific hurricanes near the coast of Mexico. The damage was extensive but was primarily wind-related. The region is not accustomed to Category 5 storms, but this could be a harbinger of things to come. It is also a reminder that infrastructure of the future will have to be adapted to our new hurricane realities. Ironically, many people have asked why there was not more storm surge damage. Dr. Jeff Masters explains that the elevation and deep water profile offshore were not conducive for the level of storm surge one might expect from a Category 5 storm. Ultimately, I think the lesson from Otis may be to prepare for the worst if a tropical storm or hurricane is headed your way. The looming challenge of rapid (and hyper) intensification will be with us. Resist normaly or recency biases. They do not prepare you for a storm that you have not experienced before."

Tensions were high on Wednesday in both Moreh and Imphal, 100 km apart, as locals reported hearing firing in Imphal city in the evening. A security official said that a mob had attempted to storm the First Manipur Rifles Campus which led to an exchange of fire with the security forces, who successfully stalled any attempt ofweapon looting, according to an official. This incident comes after a Meitei officer with the Manipur Police, Chingtham Anand Kumar, was shot dead Tuesday in Moreh, which is dominated by the Kuki-Zomi community. The 3,000-odd Meitei residents of the town have fled since violence erupted. The state cabinet had decided to launch a joint operation in Moreh and adjoining areas to nab Kumar’s killers. Additional forces of Manipur police commandos were also deployed in Moreh. The forces were ambushed twice Tuesday while moving to Moreh, and eventually a convoy of 60 commandos reached. Manipur police stated Wednesday that 44 people have been detained followingsearch operations by security forces in Moreh and 32 of these people were “found to be Myanmar-ese/Burmese”. “10 Myanmarese citizens from Moreh were taken to Foreigner Detention Centre, Sajiwa,” read a statement by the Manipur police. Tensions have now escalated in the Kuki-Zomi dominated hill areas which had already been pushing back against the presence of Manipur police in Moreh, alleging bias against their community in the ongoing conflict. Reacting to the increase in deployment of Manipur police in Moreh, multiple Kuki-Zomi community organisations have supported a call for a 48-hour shutdown starting Thursday midnight in areas dominated by the community. A “shutdown notice” issued by Kuki Student’s Organization stated, “while the demand for withdrawal of state forces in the aforesaid town (Moreh) has been gaining momentum following their excesses and total disregard to civil rights and liberties, the moves of the state government in forcefully deploying a convoy of 19 vehicles carrying Manipur police commandos and the Arambai Tenggol added more fuel to the fire in already volatile situation.” Meanwhile, Chief Minister N Biren Singh led his council of ministers, MLAs and other top officials in paying tributes to Kumar Wednesday afternoon."

At least 1.8 million people have been reached with aid in the first half of the year, but OCHA warned that access and administrative restrictions are causing ""prolonged delays or postponements of scheduled relief efforts"", adding to the suffering of affected and displaced communities. To date, the humanitarian response plan and the flash appeal launched following May's deadly Cyclone Mocha, for a combined amount of $887 million, remain ""critically underfunded"" at only 28 per cent, OCHA said.

And, these days, hunting for its meat is the least of its problems.Once found on at least five major islands in the Lesser Antilles, this giant frog is now confined to Dominica—where it once had the misfortune to be the unofficial national dish—and to a small enclosed area on the nearby island of Montserrat.Putting the mountain chicken on the mapThe mountain chicken has been on Fauna & Flora's radar before. During thevolcanic eruptionsthat began on Montserrat in 1995, and which later destroyed the capital and forced two-thirds of the population to flee, we carried out emergency surveys to assess the impact on this culturally important amphibian. This was the first time that the frog's plight was drawn to the attention of the wider world.Croak of invisibilityThe devastating fungal disease chytridiomycosis reached Montserrat in 2009, prompting the decision to evacuate as many healthyfrogsas possible and conserve the species through captive-breeding programs in zoos. Without the earlier intervention in 1995, there seems little doubt that the entire mountain chicken population on Montserrat would have succumbed, out of sight and out of mind. Unfortunately, efforts to repatriate the zoo-bred frogs have been complicated by their lack of resistance to disease.On Dominica, meanwhile, where the critically endangered frog is known as kwapo (derived from ""crapaud,"" the French word for toad) in the local Kwéyòl dialect, the deadly chytrid fungus has continued to take a heavy toll since it was first recorded on the island in 2002. Less than two years after first being detected, the disease had wiped out an estimated 80% of Dominica's entire mountain chicken population. Fears that the species was extinct on the island by 2008 proved unfounded, but a frog that was once abundant enough to be harvested for food has been reduced to perilously low numbers.Just how perilously low was uncertain, until now.Searching for Mountain chicken frogs in Dominica. Credit: Olivier Raynaud / Fauna & FloraWe're all going on a frog huntFauna & Flora was one of the many local, regional and international organizations that recently leapt into action to support a comprehensive month-long survey on Dominica, covering the mountain chicken's traditional strongholds on the island.The mission to save the mountain chicken is a highly collaborative affair involving a list of contributors and funders longer than the legs of the beleaguered frog that Fauna & Flora and its partners are working to rescue. This latest survey was five months in the planning. Almost 30 conservationists from 13 different organizations came together to form the multinational team, which spent a combined total of 960 hours in the field spread across 26 nights searching for the super-rare amphibian.How many mountain chickens are left?Working from dusk to dawn, the frog seekers bravedsteep terrainand treacherous riverbeds in their quest to find the world's last remaining wild mountain chickens. Worryingly, their combined efforts succeeded in recording just 23 frogs, including two road casualties. More encouragingly, they did encounter two juveniles and five froglets, indicating that the species is still breeding.The team also believes that the weather at one of the survey locations may have been a factor in the low number recorded there, because the extremely dry conditions meant that the frogs weren't calling (typically, their barks can be heard almost a mile away) and couldn't therefore be pinpointed using sound.Mountain chicken. Credit: Olivier Raynaud / Fauna & FloraA ray of hopeArguably the most uplifting moment was the rediscovery of a familiar frog that had been recorded years earlier. Still alive and kicking despite everything that has been thrown at him during the intervening period, this slippery survivor is at least 11 years old and officially the oldest mountain chicken on record.Which begs the question: how has this particular individual escaped the clutches of the chytrid tsunami that has been sweeping across the country for two decades? Is he the world's most fortunate frog, or has he somehow acquired resistance to the lethal effects of the fungus? Analysis of the genetic samples taken from all the captured frogs may provide further clues.Has the mountain chicken run out of time?The most recent previous estimates had put the surviving population at fewer than 50 frogs, and the results of this latest survey confirm what we already feared: mountain chicken frog numbers are continuing to decline in the face of a perfect storm of threats from natural disasters and climate-induced hurricanes, floods and wildfires to hunting, road hazards, pollution, non-native predators and deadly disease.Urgent intervention is clearly needed to save the remaining population, but the success of this collaborativerescue missionwill hinge on getting all our frogs in a row to ensure that we can address both the immediate and longer-term threats to the mountain chicken's survival.Jeanelle Brisbane, forestry officer with the Wildlife and Parks Division of Dominica's Forestry Department, and founder of local conservation NGO, WildDominique, said, ""Conservation is a collective responsibility, and the mountain chicken frog is a symbol of that shared duty. By rallying the support of government agencies and enlisting the enthusiasm of the public both on island and abroad, we can demonstrate that our iconic frog's survival is a matter of national pride. We must act now to ensure its continued presence in our natural and cultural heritage.""Isabel Vique, Fauna & Flora's then senior program manager in the Caribbean, was among those taking part in the field survey and feels a real personal connection with the species: ""Participating in the mountain chicken frog survey was an incredibly inspiring experience. Collaborating closely with conservationists from around the world, all united in our mission to prevent the extinction of this species, felt like an extraordinary privilege. I can say with certainty that few moments in my life have been as thrilling as the first time I laid eyes on a mountain chicken frog. This profound encounter, combined with the sobering findings of our survey, has fueled the team's unwavering determination to safeguard this species.""Jenny Daltry, director of the Caribbean alliance forged between Fauna & Flora and Re:wild, and whose love affair with the mountain chicken dates back to 1995 when she led the first survey in Montserrat, is under no illusions about the magnitude of the challenge ahead, but insists there is hope: ""The Caribbean has suffered the world's highest extinction rates but we have seen other wonderful species bounce back with swift and concerted support, such as the Saint Lucia amazon and Antiguan racer. We are appealing for urgent funding to enable our Dominican partners to accomplish another miracle, and save the iconicmountainchicken.""Provided byFauna & Flora InternationalCitation: Leap in the dark: On a mission to rescue the Caribbean's biggest frog (2023, October 16) retrieved 3 November 2023 "

""Children Displaced in a Changing Climate"", a joint report by UNICEF and the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center in partnership with the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, is a first-of-its-kind data analysis that shows 43 million children were forced to leave their homes in the past six years (2016-2022) — the equivalent of about 20,000 children every day — mainly due to floods and storms, but also droughts and wildfires. In Legazpi city, Albay province, the Philippines, on Nov. 11, 2020, families sheltered inside a school as Typhoon Vamco (known locally as Ulysses) bore down. yphoon Gona (Rolly) had devastated the area the week before. The island nation's location and geography make it prone to storms and floods. More than half of all child displacements from 2016 to 2022 happened in the Philippines, India and China. UNICEF report includes the first data set to focus on children Up until now, with previous data on displacement rarely distinguishing by age, these children have been statistically invisible. In places where there are other issues, like rapid urbanization, conflict and insecurity, the report notes, children on the move are even more likely to slip through the cracks. Researchers used data modeling to quantify past displacements and to project where children are likely to be displaced next. The risks of climate-related displacement are highest for children and families in countries like Mozambique, where there are limited capacities for coping with the fallout of storms and floods. Above, Francelina Antonio holding one of her two small children, took shelter at a school after the family's home was destroyed by strong winds and flooding caused by Cyclone Freddy. The report also identifies countries where a high risk of weather-related child displacement is compounded by factors such ashigh rates of poverty, conflict and other hazards — and where efforts toward risk mitigation and disaster preparedness work will be most critical. Children and communities are especially vulnerable in countries like Haiti and Mozambique, where the risk of weather disasters is high but capacities for coping with them are limited. Pakistan continues to suffer the effects of catastrophic flooding caused by record rainfall during the 2022 monsoons. Many families remain in temporary settlements, and many damaged schools remain closed. Above, a UNICEF-supported temporary learning center next to the floodwater in village Allah Dina Channa, Lasbela district, Baluchistan province. The many ways children who are displaced can suffer Displacement – whether short-lived or protracted, reactive or preemptive – can multiply climate-related risks for children and their families. In the aftermath of a disaster, children may become separated from their parents or caregivers, amplifying risks of exploitation, child trafficking and abuse. Displacement can also disrupt access to safe water, sanitation and health care, including essential vaccines, magnifying children's risk of disease. Schooling is often disrupted as well, jeopardizing children's futures. And displaced children and families don't necessarily end up in areas that are any less vulnerable to climate shocks. A young boy pulls a load of timber through a flooded field in Bentiu, Unity State, South Sudan, on Feb. 27, 2023. South Sudan and Somalia were the two countries with the greatest number of children displaced by flooding. Where in the world is this happening the most? In relative terms, Small Island Developing States and countries in the Horn of Africa are the most affected. Dominica, Saint Maarten, Northern Mariana Islands, Saint Martin, Cuba and Vanuatu recorded the most child displacements from storms, according to the report. South Sudan and Somalia experienced the greatest number of child displacements from floods — and both implement and record far fewer preemptive evacuations, suggesting children living in these hotspot locations are even more vulnerable. Hamza, 5, lives with his family in Lusharbak village, in Gulran district, western Afghanistan, an area affected by severe drought since 2020. Drought triggered more than 1.3 million internal displacements of children across 15 countries between 2016 and 2021. More than half — 730,000 — were recorded in Somalia, another 340,000 in Ethiopia and 190,000 in Afghanistan. Researchers caution that these numbers are likely to be radically underreported, due to the slow onset nature of the situation and poor reporting and monitoring mechanisms. Over the next 30 years, they project, tens of millions more children will be displaced by river flooding than cyclone winds or storm surges. Regions at highest risk are South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Read the full report. UNICEF’s call to climate action: protect, prepare and prioritize children Climate change factors into everything UNICEF does for children. The urgent need for communities and countries to adapt to and mitigate climate impacts and build resilience touches virtually every UNICEF program, from water and sanitation to health, nutrition, education and protection. Climate considerations are an integral part of UNICEF's emergency response and recovery work. With the release of the ""Children Displaced"" report, UNICEF repeated its call for global community to take action to better protect children and young people, and to better prepare them to live in a climate-changed world. Khadijo Mohamed Aden, a mother of four and farmer from Dinsoor, a town in the Bay region of Somalia, sits with her daughter Sabirin, 2, outside their makeshift home at the Gurman camp for internally displaced persons outside Mogadishu. Drought forced the family to leave home in search of food and water. Sabirin was treated for severe acute malnutrition at a UNICEF-supported health center. To improve outcomes for children and young people at risk of future displacement, UNICEF urges governments, donors, development partners and the private sector to ensure that child-critical services — education, health, social protection, child protection — are shock-responsive, portable and inclusive. Policies and solutions must prioritize their needs. And children and young people must be given opportunities to participate in climate action. UNICEF works with governments in regions and countries that are most at risk of climate-related displacements and other impacts to better prepare for and minimize those risks, develop and implement child-sensitive climate adaptation strategies, and design resilient and portable services to reach the most vulnerable children before, during and after disaster strikes. A young student inside a UNICEF-supported temporary learning center set up in Saleh Shah, Sindh province, Pakistan, for children impacted by the 2022 floods. Climate-induced flooding also hit Bangladesh, northern India and Afghanistan that year. Children suffer the most in climate-related crises — with those in the poorest communities bearing the biggest burden. UNICEF works with partners to keep children's needs at the forefront of climate action. Support UNICEF. Donate today."

A tropical storm that's churning in the North Atlantic ocean is expected to begin moving West, strengthening as it makes landfall across a string of Caribbean islands in the coming days. Forecasters say the storm system, which is being called Tammy, could gradually strengthen into a hurricane in the next 48 hours, bringing heavy rain and storm surge to the region. Here's a look at what we know. The storm currently has sustained winds of 60 mph and is moving quickly to the west towards the Lesser Antilles, according to a Thursday morning advisory fromthe National Hurricane Center(NHC). Tammy is forecast to rake across many of the smaller island countries in the eastern Caribbean, with the center of the storm passing over the Leeward Islands on Friday and Saturday. Rainfall of up to 10 inches could produce flash flooding and mudslides. Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 feet. Tropical storm watches are in effect for Barbados, Dominica, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla, St. Barthelemy, St. Martin, Saba and St. Eustatius. Meteorologists say additional watches or warnings will likely be required on Thursday and Friday. Heavy rainfall of up to 4 inches is also expected to spread across the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this weekend. By Monday, the storm is expected to swing out to sea and no longer be a threat. So far this year, the NHC has tracked18 hurricanes and tropical storms, according to the last updated count, released Oct. 1. Only about a third of those made landfall, including Idalia, which left homes and businessesunderwater as it battered the Florida coast. This year's early storm activity prompted forecasters to update their2023 season outlook, changing their ""near-normal"" projection made in May to ""above-normal"" in August. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted 14 to 21 storms, with about half of those being full-blown hurricanes. The main reason scientists expected higher levels of hurricane activity is that ocean water in areas of the Atlantic Ocean is abnormally warm this year, part of a global trend of rising ocean temperatures. Federal officials have warned peoplewho live in hurricane-prone regions not to focus on the overall number of storms, as just one storm can cause significant damage. Some of the island nations in Tammy's paths arestill recovering from Hurricane Maria, a category 5 storm that nearly wiped out places like Dominica when it made landfall six years ago. Forecasters are tracking a second storm system,Hurricane Norma, as it travels towards Baja California, Mexico. A hurricane watch is in effect for the peninsula, stretching from Todos Santos to Los Barriles. The category 3 storm is expected to weaken as it approaches land on Saturday, but could still bring rainfall totaling 15 inches over the weekend. NPR's Russell Lewiscontributed reporting."

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that Norma had 120 mph (195 kph) maximum sustained winds and was located about 345 miles (555 kilometers) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas. The Category 3 storm was moving north at 7 mph (11 kph). Ahurricanewarning was issued for the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula, but even a minor deviation from the forecast track would take a weakened Norma toward the mainland of Mexico's western Pacific coast. The Pacific coast port of Manzanillo was closed to small craft as a precaution, and the government of Baja California Sur state cancelled some classes. Norma was expected to begin weakening Friday and into the weekend as it neared land. It remained unclear if it would make landfall near Los Cabos, made up of the twin resorts of San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas, or veer off beforehand and hit Mexico’s Sinaloa state to the east. Hurricane specialist John Cangialosi, with the U.S. National Hurricane Center, said that Norma’s forecast was challenging. The storm was expected to continue moving north into Saturday, but then slow to a crawl “and should be just kind of hanging out near the southern portion of the Baja California Peninsula.” The concerns, especially if the storm slowed rather than passing quickly, were significant winds and heavy rain, he said. In the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Tammy was 165 miles (305 kilometers) east-northeast of the Caribbean island of Barbados and moving west-northwest at 10 mph (16 kph). Tammy had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph). A hurricane watch was in effect for Guadeloupe, a French overseas department, where the storm is expected around Saturday. Tammy was forecast to strengthen gradually as it moved toward the Leeward Islands this weekend and could reach hurricane strength by Saturday as it passes Guadeloupe, Antigua and Barbuda. Hurricane watches were also in effect for the islands of Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis, St. Maarten, St. Martin and St. Barthelemy. ____ Follow AP’s climate coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment"

The defence secretary defended his colleague's claim that a ""hurricane"" of mass migration is coming to the UK, saying her point was ""correct"". Her Conservative conference speech has been compared by some to Mr Powell's infamous anti-immigrant 1968 ""Rivers of Blood"" speech. Enoch Powell, a Tory MP, was ejected from the shadow cabinet as a result. In her speech, Ms Braverman said politicians have been ""too squeamish"" to take action on immigration. ""The wind of change that carried my own parents across the globe in the 20th Century was a mere gust compared to the hurricane that is coming,"" she said. The speech has been criticised by some. Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused Ms Braverman of sounding ""like Enoch Powell"", while Andrew Boff, a Conservative member of the London Assembly, was escorted from the conference hall after protesting that she was ""transphobic and homophobic"". Green Party MP Caroline Lucas called it an ""utterly repulsive speech"". UN Human Rights Commissioner Volker Türk said ""stoking fears, devaluing others, and dividing society"" are the ""politics of distraction"". Following the speech, Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch told a Spectator conference event that politicians should be careful about how immigration policies are discussed ""so that people aren't getting echoes of things that were less palatable"". Fellow cabinet minister Michelle Donelan later declined to repeat the rhetoric used by the home secretary, telling BBC Newsnight: ""I would say it's a problem, my language is different to her language."" But Mr Shapps said Ms Braverman's speech was ""certainly no Enoch Powell situation"". He pointed out that the home secretary's parents moved to the UK in the 1960s from Kenya and Mauritius. ""She makes the absolutely correct point we've already seen a lot of movement,"" he told Times Radio. ""We could see a lot more, a hurricane, as she describes it, of people moving."" Delivered to local Conservative Party members in Birmingham, days before the second reading of the 1968 Race Relations Bill, then-MP Enoch Powell referenced observations made by his Wolverhampton constituents, including ""in 15 or 20 years' time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man"". Mr Powell, who died in 1998, ended with a quote from Virgil's Aeneid, when civil war in Italy is predicted with ""the River Tiber foaming with much blood"". The anti-immigration speech ended his career in Edward Heath's shadow cabinet. The Race Relations Act made it illegal to refuse housing, employment or public services to people because of their ethnic background."

Braverm… [+3886 chars]",Mauritius,"Interior minister Suella Braverman warned Tuesday that Britain faces a ""hurricane"" of immigration, as she doubled down on her hardline rhetoric at the Conservative party's annual conference. Braverman, already a darling of the ruling party's right for her attacks on ""woke"" politics, used the keynote speech to launch a fresh attack on opponents of her uncompromising approach to migration and other so-called ""culture war"" issues. In an address heavy with sentiment but short on new policy, she singled out the main Labour opposition party as part of a ""luxury beliefs brigade"", characterising them as an out-of-touch elite to draw clear dividing lines before next year's expected election. She also blamed past politicians from all parties for being ""too squeamish about being smeared as racist"" to control immigration. Braverman, whose own parents of Indian origin emigrated to Britain in the 1960s from Kenya and Mauritius, has adopted a severe approach to the policy area since Sunak appointed her a year ago. It comes as more than 25,000 people have been detected crossing the Channel aboard small boats from northern France so far this year, and regular immigration grows to its highest level in decades. ""One of the most powerful forces reshaping our world is unprecedented mass migration,"" Braverman told the Tory grassroots. ""The wind of change that carried my own parents across the globe, in the 20th century, was a mere gust compared to the hurricane that is coming."" British voters understood that ""the future could bring millions more migrants to the shores, uncontrolled and unmanageable, unless the government they elect next year acts decisively to stop that happening"", she warned. Braverman's Conservatives, trailing Labour badly in the polls, are seen as desperate to fight the next election on ""culture war"" issues, even as Britons grapple with economic woes many blame the Tories for. She has been one of the leading right-wing voices on such matters, targeting everything from police officers taking the knee in support of racial justice to transgender rights. She has previously described critics of her stance as the ""Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati"". Elsewhere at the conference, the Conservatives said they would be ""kicking woke ideology out of science"", while one minister falsely claimed Labour wanted to ban people eating meat. In her new attacks Tuesday, Braverman said the Conservatives stand with ""the law-abiding, hard-working, common sense majority against the few, the privileged woke minority with their luxury beliefs who wield influence out of proportion to their numbers"". ""Our politically-correct critics have money, they have status, they have loud voices,"" Braverman added. ""The luxury beliefs brigade sit in their ivory towers, telling ordinary people that they are morally deficient because they dare to get upset about the impact of illegal migration, net zero or habitual criminals."" Predicting these critics would ""flock"" to Labour at the next election, Braverman said voters would decide ""if they want to curb woke with Rishi Sunak or let it run riot with Kier 'take-the-knee' Starmer"". Although attendees rewarded her with a standing ovation, not all of the party is on board with her rhetoric. Andrew Boff, a Conservative member of the London Assembly, was escorted from the hall after protesting that she was ""transphobic and homophobic"". Meanwhile, former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused Braverman of sounding ""like Enoch Powell"", the 1960s-era firebrand Tory lawmaker who warned of racial civil war if mass immigration from Britain's old Empire was unchecked. Far-right groups still hold him up as a figurehead. The Guardian said Braverman's speech strayed ""into far-right territory"" because of her ""contempt for liberal and legal norms"", and suggested the Tories could soon be classed as a far-right party. Former minister Rory Stewart, who stood for the party leadership, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: ""I sometimes think this conference is simply designed to drive the last moderate Tories out."""

A Delhi-based Catholic priest uncle of UK Home Secretary Suella Braverman has cautioned his niece about some of her language around immigration and urged her not to forget that she herself is a child of migrants. According to a report in 'The Times' on Saturday, Father Ayres Fernandes told the newspaper from India that he sees the need to clamp down on illegal immigration. However, the director of a retreat centre in Okhla said there was a need for more compassion towards refugees and asylum seekers. ""I only pray that she remembers that she herself was born to migrant parents, and therefore, she needs to be a little cautious when making such comments,"" said Fernandes. The priest, who grew up in Kenya with his four siblings, including Braverman's father, Christie Fernandes , is believed to be estranged from his brother. Formerly a director at the Conference of Catholic Bishops of India , the 73-year-old told the British newspaper that he and another family member had discussed Braverman's political posturing with a relative and speculated her hardline approach may be due to being backed by Conservative Party right-wingers. ""She's quite strong by herself, that much I know, she has her own thinking. But I believe that there is somebody backing her up to make such comments. But being a minister, holding such a position, maybe she should be a little cautious,"" he said. It comes after Braverman's Tory conference speech in Manchester earlier this week attracted criticism from within her own party ranks, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also refusing to back her statement about a ""hurricane"" of migrants. ""The wind of change that carried my own parents across the globe in the 20th century was a mere gust compared to the hurricane that is coming. Because today, the option of moving from a poorer country to a richer one is not just a dream for billions of people, it is an entirely realistic prospect,"" said Braverman. The minister of Goan heritage on her father's side and Tamil heritage on her mother's, families that migrated to Britain from Kenya and Mauritius , had also called into question the country's multiculturalism in a speech in the US last week. ""Uncontrolled immigration, inadequate integration, and a misguided dogma of multiculturalism have proven a toxic combination for Europe over the last few decades... Multiculturalism has failed,"" she declared. Her uncle said that while he is not in regular contact with his niece, he had congratulated her when she became Home Secretary last year. The priest told 'The Times' that they happen to share a birthday and feels she is similar to a younger him as ""very strong people in our thinking and attitude"". ""But with my experiences, I learned you need to change, you need to adjust, you need to give space to people and their way of life and opinions. And in politics that is very important - to be able to be open to others and others' views and opinions. I pray for her every day that she may be able to calm down and relate with people in a better manner,"" he said. "

Countries' climate action plans are still far behind what's needed to curb human-caused warming and limit the devastating effects of extreme heat, storms and droughts, but some nations have taken marginal steps toward slashing emissions, a United Nations analysis of national plans found Tuesday. The report looked into the climate plans of 195 countries and found that emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas will go up 9% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels, but will be 2% lower than 2019 levels because of some climate action from countries switching to cleaner energy. But climate scientists warn that the world needs to spew around 45% less by then. ""The world is failing to get a grip on the climate crisis,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. ""Inch by inch progress will not do. It is time for a climate ambition supernova in every country, city, and sector."" He called for ""net-zero"" — when countries only spew as much carbon into the atmosphere as they can take back out — in developed countries to happen by ""as close as possible"" to 2040, and 2050 for developing nations. The U.N. climate chief, Simon Stiell, urged that upcoming international climate talks in Dubai become a ""turning point"" where governments can get on track with plans to cut emissions in line with capping warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), as agreed by nations in Paris in 2015. ""Governments must not only agree what stronger climate actions will be taken but also start showing exactly how to deliver them,"" Stiell said in a press statement. He said that billions around the world expect governments to act on climate change. Sultan al-Jaber, president of the COP28 climate talks in Dubai and chief of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, said the report shows ""there is simply no time left for delays."" Extreme weather events charged by the warming atmosphere are increasing in magnitude and frequency around the world. The last 12 months were the hottest yearlong period ever recorded, according to a recent analysis. Many recent droughts, floods and storms were found to have fingerprints of human-cause climate change, according to attribution scientists. When countries meet in Dubai, they'll review their climate action for the last three years as part of what's been called a ""global stocktake."" Negotiators plan to use this report and discussions later this year to figure out what nations need to do next to fight climate change. Climate activists said the report is just one more reason why global leaders should be held accountable for their inaction at the talks. ""It's already hell for a lot of people,"" said Disha Ravi, an Indian activist with the youth climate group Fridays for Future, of current extreme weather. ""I sometimes wonder if they (leaders) care about lives at all."" ""Leaders have continued prioritizing profits over the health and safety of our planet and its inhabitants,"" she said. ""We cannot continue this way."""

A new AI tool from Google DeepMind predicted where September's hurricane Lee would make landfall in Canada three days ahead of existing methods. Weather forecasts have become much more accurate over the decades. But AI's speed and ability to analyse past events to make predictions make it a game-changer, say scientists. An accurate weather forecast is useful to tell you what to wear when you go out in the morning but - much more importantly - can forewarn us of extreme weather like storms, floods and heatwaves, giving communities crucial time to prepare. However, traditional weather forecasts take vast amounts of computing power. They involve creating estimates of hundreds of factors including air pressure, temperature, wind speeds and humidity at different levels of the atmosphere around the globe. A new AI tool called GraphCast created by Google DeepMind outperforms the European Medium Range Weather Forecasting model - one the best in the world - on more than 90% of those factors, according to a peer-reviewed paper published by DeepMind in the journal Science. GraphCast produces its forecasts in less than a minute, using a fraction of the computing power of traditional forecasting methods because it takes a very different approach. Traditional weather forecasting involves taking measurements of what is happening in the atmosphere right now. The best models take in hundreds of millions of readings from around the world every day. These come from a huge range of sources including weather stations, satellites, balloons sent up in the atmosphere, buoys in the ocean - even readings taken by sensors on the noses of commercial jet planes. ""We then use our model to select which are going to be the most important,"" explains Matthew Chantry, of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMRWF) who says about 10 million of the measurements will be used for one of its forecasts. This ocean of data is fed into a supercomputer to be processed by programmes which can do quadrillions (a thousand trillion) of calculations every second. These use complex equations to simulate what happens in the Earth's atmosphere to predict how the weather will change and evolve over time. This method has been extraordinarily successful. As the models have improved and the computers have got more powerful over the decades, weather forecasts have got significantly more accurate. But these numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, as they are known, take vast amounts of computer resources, using some of the biggest supercomputers in the world and typically take hours to produce their forecasts. AI shortcuts much of this effort. It does not try to model how the world works. Instead, GraphCast uses machine learning to digest vast quantities of historical data - including the output of the ECMRWF model - to learn how weather patterns evolve. It uses this knowledge to predict how the weather now is likely to change in the future. And it is proving very effective. ""The main advantage of this AI approach is that it's extremely accurate,"" said Remy Lam of Google DeepMind, who helped create the weather tool. ""It learns from decades of data and is able to be more accurate than the industry gold standard,"" he says. And, because it does not try to solve complex equations, it can make its forecasts very quickly and using much less computing power. GraphCast's forecasts are not as detailed as those produced by the ECMRWF but it is better at predicting severe events like extreme temperatures and at tracking the path of big storms. It accurately predicted where Hurricane Lee, a storm that hit the Atlantic coast of the US and Canada in September, would make landfall, for example. Deep Mind's AI tool predicted its path nine days ahead, the ECMRWF only managed six days ahead. But the success of GraphCast does not mean we can shut down the supercomputers and rely on AI instead. Even Remy Lam from Google DeepMind says that will not happen. ""We are standing on the shoulders of giants to build those models"", he says. Rather than replacing traditional weather forecasts AI models will complement them, he believes. ""AI models are trained from data and that data is generated by traditional approaches, so we still need the traditional approach to gather data to train the model,"" says Mr Lam. GraphCast is open source which means Google DeepMind is sharing the details of the design so anyone can use the technology. Many technology companies and weather and climate organisations around the world are designing their own AI weather prediction tools. The Met Office, the UK's national weather service, is working with the Turing Institute, the country's data science centre to explore the potential for AI to improve weather forecasting, for example. ""Weather forecasts derived from artificial intelligence and machine learning are taking huge leaps forward,"" acknowledges Prof Simon Vosper, the Met Office's Director of Science. But he warns climate change will limit the predictive power of AI based tools. ""We are seeing new climate-related weather extremes, such as last year's 40C temperatures in the UK that would haven't been realised in former times"", says Prof Vosper. The way extreme weather systems evolve may also be changing. Hurricane Otis rapidly intensified from a tropical storm into the strongest category 5 hurricane over just 24 hours in October before making devastating landfall on the coast of southern Mexico. Climate scientists warn rising ocean temperatures are likely to make this process of rapid intensification of storms more common. ""So it is fair to question whether AI-based systems are able to pick up new extremes if these systems have only been 'trained' on previous weather conditions,"" suggests Prof Vosper."

Here, a Louisiana home damaged by a hurricane sits waiting for unaffordable repairs.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption Climate change is expensive, deadly and preventable, according to the new National Climate Assessment, the most sweeping, sophisticated federal analysis of climate change compiled to date. Released every five years, the National Climate Assessment is a congressionally mandated evaluation of the effects of climate change on American life. This new fifth edition paints a picture of a nation simultaneously beset by climate-driven disasters and capable of dramatically reducing emissions of planet-warming gasses in the near future. This is the first time the assessment includes standalone chapters about climate change's toll on the American economy, as well as the complex social factors driving climate change and the nation's responses. And, unlike past installments, the new assessment draws heavily from social science, including history, sociology, philosophy and Indigenous studies. The new approach adds context and relevance to the assessment's robust scientific findings, and underscores the disproportionate danger that climate change poses to poor people, marginalized communities, older Americans and those who work outdoors. ""Climate change affects us all, but it doesn't affect us all equally,"" says climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, one of the authors of the assessment. But threaded throughout the report are case studies and research summaries highlighting ways ""climate action can create a more resilient and just country,"" she says. This is also the first time the National Climate Assessment will be translated into Spanish, although the Spanish-language version won't be available until the spring, according to the White House. The National Climate Assessment is extremely influential in legal and policy circles, and affects everything from court cases about who should foot the bill for wildfire damage, to local decisions about how tall to build coastal flood barriers. ""It really shapes the way that people understand, and therefore act, in relation to climate change,"" says Michael Burger, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. Hundreds of scientists from universities, industry, and federal agencies contributed to the report. They reviewed cutting-edge research published since the last report and contextualized it in decades of foundational climate research. The fifth edition of the assessment arrives as millions of Americans are struggling with the effects of a hotter Earth. Dramatic and deadly wildfires, floods and heat waves killed hundreds of people in the United States in 2023. And, while federal spending on renewable energy and disaster preparedness has increased, the U.S. is alsoinvesting in new fossil fuel infrastructurethat is not compatible with avoiding catastrophic warming later this century. Here are the three big takeaways from theFifth National Climate Assessment. More information about the specific effects of climate change in your area can be found in the assessment'sregional chapters. Windmills near Whitewater, Calif., in 2020.

Chiu/APhide caption Windmills near Whitewater, Calif., in 2020. avoid billions of dollars of economic costs and help Americans live longer, healthier lives according to the Fifth National Climate Assessment. Food, housing, labor – it all gets pricier as the Earth heats up, according to the National Climate Assessment. Climate-driven weather disasters, like heat waves, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, are particularly expensive. They destroy homes and businesses, wreck crops and create supply shortages by delaying trucks, ships and trains. Such disasters make it more likely that families will go bankrupt, and that municipal governments will run deficits, the authors note. Weather-related disasters in the U.S. cause about $150 billion each year in direct losses, according to the report. That's a lot of money – roughly equal to the annual budget for the Energy Department – and it's only expected to go up as the Earth gets hotter. Loading... And that's all before factoring in the less obvious or tangible costs of climate change. For example, healthcare bills for people who are sicker because of extreme heat, or have respiratory illness brought on by breathing in mold after a flood. Exposure to wildfire smoke alone costs billions of dollars a year in lost earnings, the assessment notes – a burden that falls disproportionately on poor people who work outdoors. ""The research indicates that people who are lower income have more trouble adapting [to climate change], because adaptation comes at a cost,"" says Solomon Hsiang, a climate economist at the University of California, Berkeley and a lead author of the assessment. For example, one of the simplest ways to adapt to severe heat waves is to run your air conditioner more. But ""if people can't pay for it, then [they] can't protect themselves,"" explains Hsiang. And the hotter it gets, the more profound the economic harm, assessment warns. Twice as much planetary warming leads to more than twice as much economic harm, the assessment warns.

The latest National Climate Assessment underscores the many ways that climate change is already making Americans sick, and even killing them.Claire Harbage/NPRhide caption A roadside memorial to those who died in the wildfire that swept through the town of Lahaina, Hawaii in August. The latest National Climate Assessment underscores the many ways that climate change is already making Americans sick, and even killing them. Since the previous NCA was released five years ago, the health costs of climate change have gone from theoretical to personal for many Americans. The most obvious risk? Extreme weather, particularly heat, says Mary Hayden, the lead author of the chapter examining human health. Heat waves have become hotter, longer, and more dangerous, and they're hitting areas that aren't ready for them–like the ""record-shattering"" heat dome that descended on the Pacific Northwest in 2021 and caused hundreds of deaths. But it's not just heat. Wildfire smoke can send people thousands of miles from the fires to hospitals with respiratory problems and heart disease complications. Hurricanes can disrupt people's access to healthcare: when a clinic is flooded or people are displaced, for example,kidney patients can't get dialysis treatment. In most cases, the people who bear the brunt of the disasters are those already at risk: poor communities, communities of color, women, people with disabilities, and other marginalized groups. Temperatures in formerly redlined neighborhoods in cities across the country cansoar nearly 15 degrees Fahrenheit hotterthan wealthier areas just blocks away, putting residents at much higher risk of heat exposure. The assessment also homes in on research tracking less-obvious health impacts. Living through climate disasters, for example, can leave lasting emotional scars. ""We're not just talking about [people's] physical health–we're talking about their mental health. We're talking about their spiritual health. We're talking about the health and well-being of communities which are being affected by this,"" Hayden says. That means recognizing the long-term effects on communities like Paradise, California, where people still deal withdeep emotional traumafive years after their town burned in the 2018 Camp Fire. The report also flags the growing emotional toll on children and young people, for whom anxiety about the future of the planet is bleeding into all parts of their lives. A lobsterman paddles out to his boat in a harbor in Maine. Climate change is disrupting ways of living with, and from, the ocean.Ryan Kellmanhide caption The places, cultural practices, and traditions that anchor many communities are also in flux because of climate change. Fishing communities are seeing their livelihoods shift or collapse. The Northeast's iconic lobster fishery, the single most economically valuable in the country, haswithered as marine heatwaves sweep through the regional seas. Shrinking snowpack and too-warm temperatures are interrupting opportunities for beloved recreational activities,like skiing or ice fishing. Indigenous communities are being forced to adjust to new climate realities, which are disrupting traditional food-gathering traditions. In Palau, a monthly tradition of catching fish at a particularly low tide has been upset by sea level rise, which keeps water levels too high to trap fish in thehistorically-used places. Sea level rise is also forcing coastal communities tore-think their very existence,pulling apart the social fabric that has developed over generations. But many communities – Indigenous people, farmers and fishers, groups that have lived tightly connected to their environments for a long time – have deep stores of resilience from which to draw, says Elizabeth Marino, a sociologist and the lead author of the chapter on social transformations. ""There is quite a lot of wisdom in place to adapt to and even mitigate climate change,"" she says. ""It allows people to come up with solutions that fit the lives that they lead, and that's also a place of hope."" The fifth assessment lays out a stark picture of the climate challenges the U.S. faces. Keeping planetary warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the goal of the international Paris Agreement, will require immediate, enormous cuts to fossil fuel emissions in the U.S and beyond. Keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), an ambitious target written into the Agreement, will be even harder, the report says. But it also points out many successful efforts underway to adapt to the new reality and to prevent worse outcomes. ""It's not the message that if we don't hit 1.5 degrees, we're all going to die,"" says Hayhoe. ""It's the message that everything we do matters. Every 10th of a degree of warming we avoid, there's a benefit to that."" Addressing fossil fuel-driven climate change can also help people live healthier lives, stresses J. Jason West, the lead author on a chapter on air quality. Dialing back fossil fuel emissions would help prevent further climate change and also lessen the kinds of air pollution most harmful to human health."" There really is a lot of opportunity to take action that would resolve both of those problems at the same time,"" West says. There's been a subtle shift in the report's perspective since the last one, says Candis Callison, a sociologist and author of the report. There's now a clear acknowledgement, developed through years of rigorous research, that the fossil fuel-powered society the U.S. built over generations was profoundly unjust. Many pollution-producing coal or gas power plants weresited in communities of colorrather than white communities, affecting people's health outcomes for generations. And decisions about land and water use for energy extractionoften excluded tribal communities, with consequences still playing out today. The transition forward can look different, she says. ""Climate change actually provides us with an opportunity to address some of those inequities and injustices–and to respond to these impacts,"" Callison says. ""That's really a powerful thing."""

The report issues a stark warning that extreme events and harmful impacts of climate change that Americans are already experiencing, such as heat waves, wildfires, and extreme rainfall, will worsen as temperatures continue to rise. The Fifth National Climate Assessment, issued every five years, is a definitive breakdown of the latest in climate science coming from 14 different federal agencies, including NOAA, NASA, the EPA, and the National Science Foundation. This year's report is more comprehensive than in previous because climate modeling has improved, and the authors took a more holistic look at physical and social impacts of climate change. ""We also have a much more comprehensive understanding of how climate change disproportionately affects those who've done the least to cause the problem,"" Katherine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and co-author of the report, said in a briefing with reporters. Some communities are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, the report says, warning that Black, Hispanic, and indigenous communities are more likely to face challenges accessing water as droughts become more intense. Climate change also creates more health risks for marginalized communities, according to the report, which says that “systemic racism and discrimination exacerbate” the impacts. The report lays out how every part of the US is being impacted by climate change and that some areas are facing multiple worsening impacts at the same time. For example, western states saw heat waves and wildfires during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which strained resources and added to the risk of severe illness. In the same year, back-to-back storms during the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season are some examples of climate-driven compounding events that caused unprecedented demand on federal emergency response resources. The report detailed some impacts of climate change that are being felt across the U.S., including increased risk of extreme heat and rainfall, among other weather-related events. Other impacts cited werecoastal erosionand threats to coastal communities from flooding; damage to land including wildfires anddamage to forests;warming oceans and damage to ecosystems likecoral reefs;risks from extreme events like fires; heatwaves and flooding, and increased inequality for minority orlow-income communities. Some areas of the U.S. are also seeing more specific impacts, such as more intense droughts in the Southwest. The assessment also notes changes in storm trends as a result of climate change. Heavy snowfall is becoming more common in the Northeast and hurricane trends are changing, with increases in North Atlantic hurricane activity and the intensification of tropical cyclones. 2023 was a record setting year forbillion-dollar climate disastersin the United States, officials noted in a White House briefing last week. The report also highlights some areas of success, saying more action has been taken across the board to reduce emissions and address climate change since the last report in 2018. Greenhouse gas emissions generated by the U.S. have been steadily decreasing since their peak in 2007, even as the energy demand goes up -- mainly due to a vast reduction in the use of coal, according to the report. Efforts to adapt to and respond to climate change need to be more ""transformative,"" the report found. This includes reducing the use of coal, building more wind turbines and electrifying buildings and making more efforts to protect people from the impacts of climate change. Individuals and government leaders should look at the report as a way to help communities across the country mitigate, adapt and become more resilient to the effects of climate change, White House Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi said. The assessment demonstrates ""both a real and profound environmental risk, but also a real and profound economic opportunity,"" Zaidi said. The administration has also noted that adding clean energy jobs is a top priority. The last time the National Climate Assessment was released, then-President Donald Trump said hedid not believe the findings. The 2018 report found that climate change could lead to massive economic loss, especially by vulnerable communities. In addition to theFifth National Climate Assessment, which is U.S.-focused, two global climate reports were also released on Tuesday, analyzing the current state of climate change policy action around the world. UN Climate Changereleased a progress report on climate action ahead of the COP28 conference set to kick off in Dubai on November 30th. The report highlights that progress on global climate action is moving too slow to keep up with the effects of global warming. ""The Global Stocktake report released by UN Climate Change this year clearly shows where progress is too slow. But it also lays out the vast array of tools and solutions put forward by countries. Billions of people expect to see their governments pick up this toolbox and put it to work,"" Simon Stiell, Executive-Secretary of UN Climate Change said. The 2023 State of Climate Actionreportwas also released on Tuesday, highlighting similar concerns that global climate action is not moving fast enough. ""In a year where climate change has been wreaking havoc across the world, it’s clear global efforts to curb emissions are falling short."" Louise Jeffery of NewClimate Institute and one of the report’s lead authors said."

Hundreds of properties lie on old colliery spoil sites, with Welsh ministers drawing a list of 350 tips at highest risk and needing regular checks. It follows a landslide in Tylorstown, Rhondda Cynon Taf, after 2020 storms. The Coal Tip Safety Taskforce has now identified 2,566 disused coal tips in Wales, mostly in the southern valleys. The taskforce, set up by the Welsh government, includes the Coal Authority, local councils and Natural Resources Wales (NRW). Old tips are graded according to risk, with 267 in category C needing an annual inspection and 83 in category D needing twice-yearly inspections. The remaining 2,200 tips in categories A and B will need fewer checks, but inspections have also already started on tips in category B too. The tips are a legacy of decades of coal mining in Wales, which at its peak in the early 20th Century saw 620 collieries operating. When coal was dug out, the ""spoil"" or waste material removed at the same time was piled into tips and became part of the landscape in mining communities. But bad weather brings the risk that some may become unstable, and this led to a major exercise over the last three years to collect comprehensive data on each tip. The C and D priority tips involve around 1,500 different landowners and 600 people who have properties on them. The exercise has shown the complexity of land ownership around tips - some can have multiple owners. Just over a third of tips in the most at-risk categories are in public ownership, but most are privately or commercially owned. All land and property owners have been written to, while people living in communities close to C and D tips are being invited to online briefings and five public meetings over the next few weeks. More than half the priority tips are in neighbouring local council areas - Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT), Merthyr Tydfil and Caerphilly. RCT has more than a third of the category D tips but the inspection programme covers 14 council areas, as far afield as Wrexham and Pembrokeshire. It does not include extra monitoring work carried out by councils and NRW, especially in the wake of storm or flooding events. Meanwhile, technology such as drones, tilt meters and sensors is being deployed at 70 of the 83 category D tips, with hopes that new techniques will be developed with the help of university research. NRW also has weather stations, including rain gauges, at 10 of the highest risk tips. The taskforce is also in contact with the mortgage and insurance industry about the inspection programme, hoping it will offer assurance over property prices and premiums. Minister for Climate Change Julie James made the announcement in the Senedd, saying it had been a ""mammoth undertaking"" to record and categorise all disused coal tips in Wales into a single central database for the first time. ""We have focused on category C and D tips as they are more likely to need frequent inspections so we can identify and carry out any maintenance when needed,"" she said. ""It does not mean they are unsafe, but they may be larger and are more likely to be closer to communities or major infrastructure."" So far, £44.4m has been provided until the end of 2024-25 to cover maintenance of old tips. Tylorstown is one of the category D tip sites and has been subject to remediation works, which are expected to cost more than £12.5m. Former miner Jeff Coombes, 76, lives close to the foot of the Tylorstown tip and recalls the events of February 2020. ""It was a roaring noise - I didn't know what it was - it wasn't until someone said 'have you seen the tip?' and as I looked over there, I saw it was coming down,"" he said. ""It was mounting and mounting, until at the end it filled the river up and you were looking at it with amazement."" Was he reassured by the monitoring? ""It's got to be done. But when will it be done? It's money isn't it. Probably that's how coal was so cheap, they dumped the rubbish anywhere. It's got to be done - we don't want another Aberfan do we?"" The tragedy in the village of Aberfan saw a total of 116 children and 28 adults killed when a colliery spoil tip collapsed, engulfing a primary school and surrounding houses on 21 October 1966. ""Tip slides are the main problem of course - the most infamous and horrific example of that was the Aberfan disaster,"" said coalfield historian Dr Ben Curtis. He said a lot had been done in the wake of Aberfan but ""the nature of the coal industry is that these tips were produced, the industry has gone but the tips in many cases are still with us and still remain the potential to cause problems in the future"". This is the first time a comprehensive list of tips and site owners has been produced and made available. The maps have been published online, bringing together data from satellite images, old World War Two aerial photography, OS mapping, old mine records and site surveys. New legislation is also currently being drawn up which aims to enshrine the safety of old tips in law to cover management, monitoring and maintenance. ""Our priority is to ensure that people living and working near coal tips feel safe and secure now and in the future,"" said Ms James. ""Our proposals will achieve that by setting in place a long-term, fit for purpose regime which will be led by a newly-created public body."" Do you live close to a coal tip?

But the effects of a warming climate are being felt throughout the year, and recent autumn months have been further off the charts than ever.In fact,climate changeand an El Niño have both contributed to the world in 2023 having itshottest autumnsince records began in 1850.Septemberwas 0.93°C above the 1991-2020 average, and a whole 1.75°C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial reference period. October was also the hottest on record, at0.85°Cabove the recent average.This hotautumnhas already meant stronger storms and more intense rainfall and droughts. And this in turn affects farming, energy, tourism and other sectors that depend on reliable seasons.A global system but local effectsWarmer oceans have been linked tointensification of stormsin the Atlantic. One of these, Storm Babet, recently broke UK rainfall recordsdating back to 1881. Babet was soon followed byStorm Ciarán, bringing more extreme winds and heavy rainfall to still-saturated lands.The UK is no stranger to Atlantic storm systems, but they primarily occur during the winter months. The fact that thesesevere stormsare occurring in autumn is unusual.Partly this is because anabnormally warm Atlantic Oceanis generating stronger storms (in174 years of data, August and September 2023 were the two months wheresea surface temperatureswere furthest above the long-term average). Warmer oceans release more moisture into the atmosphere and carry more energy which effectively acts as fuel for storms.When the tropical Atlantic is warm, storms generated there also change direction, tending totrack northward across the ocean before bending to the east. In future, warmer autumns are likely to mean more of these storms sustaining themselves across the Atlantic to hit Western Europe.Storms are getting stronger elsewhere too.Hurricane Otisrecently devastated the Mexican city of Acapulco, for instance. Otis developed from a regular storm into a huge hurricane in record time, and was the first time in history that a hurricane in the Eastern Pacific made landfall and sustained itself as a the strongest ""Category 5""storm.Tropical Cyclone Tejhit the Arabian Peninsula the week before with 480mm of rainfall in the Al–Ghaydah region in Yemen—eight times the annual average.Problems for farms and energy generationIn unusually warm autumns, extended periods ofheat and low rainfallcan impact late-season crops such as apples, pears, berries and brassicas. In November 2022, warm and dry weather resulted in theearly emergence of some winter cropsacross many European regions. In 2022, China experienced a shock to its autumn yields ofwheat and some vegetablesfollowing an extended period of drought and elevated temperatures into the Autumn harvesting season.Energy generation is also increasingly vulnerable to autumn heat. In 2022, a warm autumn meant Europeans used less natural gas for heating, and instead used electricityfor cooling. Drought adds acompoundingchallenge, as less power can be generated through hydroelectric dams, while less reliable reservoir levels make it harder to schedule generation in advance tocoincide with periods of peak demand. In late summer and autumn last year in France, rivers became so warm they were less able tocool down nuclear reactors.Autumn as the new summer?Tourism is just as vulnerable to unseasonal temperatures. While numbers are often dictated by external factors such as school holidays, extreme summer temperatures will increasingly see people going awayin spring and autumn instead.Yet even autumn destinations are finding things are changing. New England in the US is known for its spectacular colorful trees at this time of year, yet warming conditions are changing thetiming and vibrancyof its leaf fall. Autumn heatvariationcould impact the volume of visitors, threatening abillion dollartourism industry.Something similar is being observed inJapan, where leaves are staying on trees until later in the year. This can create further hazards, as when trees havemore leaf surface areathey're more exposed to destructive wind storms.These are just some of the effects of an unusually warm autumn, even by current standards.

Nadda made the remark while addressing a public meeting in Alot assembly constituency in the district on Tuesday in view of the forthcoming state assembly polls scheduled to be held this week . ""There is a model of the Congress party, which is a 'laapata model' (missing model). During their (Congress) tenure, water supply, development, electricity, roads and everything was missing,"" Nadda said. Meanwhile, taking a dig at the Kamal Nath-led Congress government on the occasion, Nadda asked the public whether the Kamal Nath government of 15 months in the state stop CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan's Sambal Yojana or not? #Elections With Assembly Election News All Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan Telangana Chhattisgarh Mizoram Congress has become burden for country: Adityanath A storm is blowing in Madhya Pradesh that will uproot Congress's 'tambu': PM Narendra Modi Rahul targets BJP, claims people didn't even get Re 1 from Bundelkhand package approved by UPA govt AIMIM Chief slams Telangana Congress chief alleges, ""He won't leave RSS"" On the other hand, addressing a public gathering in the district on Tuesday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said that the perception of India changed in the last nine and half years, now it is not considered a weak country. ""Earlier, the perception about India was that it is a weak country, a country of poor but this has changed in the last nine and a half years. Today India is not considered a weak country. Earlier, when India used to speak something on international platforms, people did not listen to it seriously, but today when India speaks on international platforms, the other countries listen carefully,"" Singh said. India's stature increased in the entire world. Not only this, in terms of economy, earlier India stood at 11th place in the world and today India has taken a jump and stands at fifth place, the union minister added. Apart from this, while addressing a rally in Shajapur district on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that the storm of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would uproot Congress in Madhya Pradesh. ""I have met people in various parts of MP in the past few days and sought their blessings. The trust being shown in the BJP is amazing. Those making electoral calculations while sitting in Delhi could not make their assessment. Because of people's tremendous support, the BJP storm in Madhya Pradesh will uproot Congress,"" the PM said. The state is set to undergo polls on November 17 and the counting of votes will take place on December 3. Voters will choose legislators from 230 Assembly constituencies. Notably, the last state assembly polls in 2018 saw the Congress coming to power, with veteran leader Kamal Nath taking oath as the chief minister. Nonetheless, a political upheaval rocked the state in 2020 after then-Congressman Jyotiraditya Scindia, along with 22 loyalist MLAs, switched over to the saffron camp. The Congress government fell after being reduced to a minority and the BJP formed the government, with Shivraj Singh Chouhan returning as chief minister. "

This remarkable achievement, as reported by the Israel Innovation Authority, a government agency, not only shattered previous records but also defied the prevailing trends in venture capital funding. While the last two years witnessed a dip in VC funding for Israeli startups, echoing global patterns, the nation has demonstrated an unparalleled resilience and remains an unequivocal choice for technology investment. Amidst the challenges and uncertainties, Israeli companies stand as exemplars of operational resilience, showcasing an ability to not only weather storms but to thrive and redefine success in the dynamic landscape of the tech sector. Gal Biran, founder of Base.ai shares that the unwavering priority to ensure safety and wellbeing of his team is critical. Collaboratively, with the entire team, steps were taken to ensure minimal impact on customers and the business, epitomizing a dedication to operational resilience. This narrative echoes the deeper ethos that transcends business metrics—a testament to the resilience, humanity, and adaptability inherent in the Israeli tech sector. Navigating Through Adversity Israel's thriving tech sector, resilient through past crises like financial downturns and the Covid-19 pandemic, faces a unique challenge due to the recent war triggered by the Hamas assault. The conflict, resulting in over 1,300 casualties in Israel, has disrupted daily life, leading to the closure of schools, deserted streets in Tel Aviv, and numerous businesses shutting down. This time, the impact on the country's pivotal industry is distinctive, with closures attributed not only to security concerns but also to employees being called up for military service. The most immediate repercussion of the war on tech companies is evident in the workforce. Israel has mobilized over 300,000 military reservists to participate in the conflict, primarily individuals who were working and studying within the country, with a few returning from overseas. According to SNC's estimates, approximately 10% of tech personnel in Israel have been conscripted, and in certain companies, this figure has surged to as high as 30%. Despite the challenges of conflict, the industry remains a crucial lifeline, drawing unwavering support from seasoned investors dedicated to helping the nation rebuild. This solidarity is evident in the global tech community's response, with over 500 VC funds signing a ""Statement of Support"" for Israeli startups, entrepreneurs, and investors. Recognizing Israel's role in the global innovation ecosystem, the statement reflects a collective commitment to stand by the country and its people. Tech companies themselves have exemplified unity, setting aside differences with the government to contribute to the war effort. From procuring vital equipment for soldiers to leveraging expertise in AI and cybersecurity, the industry demonstrates a cohesive response in coming together. The Impact On Business—Becoming Resilient Through Change In the midst of navigating war, tech founders are exemplifying resilience in unprecedented ways. A poignant reflection comes from one CEO who encapsulates the essence of operational resilience while nurturing a thriving company. ""At the end of the day, we’re here to build a thriving company. And it becomes extremely harder in a time when every employee is affected by the atrocities we all experienced,"" says, Ittay Hayut, Co-founder & CEO of hoopo. In the face of adversity, these leaders recognize the paramount role they play in supporting their employees emotionally and caring for their wellbeing. Their unwavering commitment is clear: to maintain success, they must prioritize the people who make it all possible—their workforce. This commitment manifests in tangible ways, with CEO at hoopo, noting the humbling instances of employees rallying together. Whether it's witnessing acts of mutual assistance or the proactive stance of the US team, demanding more tasks to support their Israeli colleagues, the collective strength of the workforce stands out. ""I know we will keep innovating and creating value and change in the world while we stand strong – as a nation, in startups, and as individuals,” said Gal Biran, the CEO and Co-Founder of Base.ai, a MarTech company designed to deliver a designated customer marketing platform helping B2B organizations create personalized lifecycle engagement with their customer base at scale. Israeli startup raises $15 million for marketing customer-led growth vision Surprisingly, amidst the challenges, these tech companies are experiencing a surge in output that surpasses expectations. Both Gal Biran CEO and Co-Founder of Base.ai and Ittay Hayut, the Co-founder & CEO at hoopo attributes this to the team's resilience and determination to push forward, viewing it not just as a response to adversity but as a real triumph against terror. This narrative showcases a broader theme in the tech industry, where the spirit of unity and perseverance emerges as a powerful force against the backdrop of global challenges. Building Community And Driving Toward Organizational Change Many founders are standing at the forefront, navigating the intersection of innovation and operational resilience. Israeli founders are prioritizing the safety and wellbeing of their teams. In an interview, with a few Israeli tech founders, many highlighted the second level of action—creating operational resilience and business continuity—is integral to their strategic approach. With a global team, half of whom are based outside of Israel, Gal and his team have successfully minimized the impact on both customers and business operations. Talia Soen, the Co-Founder and CEO of Happy Things, took decisive action, embodying the transformative power of Israeli founders. When the devastating events of October 7th unfolded, Soen swiftly shifted her focus from startup operations to hands-on involvement in civil volunteering initiatives. The mission was clear: to actively contribute to the community's immediate needs, from purchasing food to assisting in shipping and aiding survivors' camps. Harnessing the unique capabilities of Happy Things—a mental health app—Soen and her team provided their product free of charge to all those in Israel, recognizing the profound impact of mental well-being during trying times. This proactive response reflected not only a commitment to their product but also a dedication to the broader societal fabric. In the face of frozen company processes—halted hiring, slowed recruitment, and paused development projects due to widespread military engagement—Soen acknowledged the mental toll reminiscent of the early pandemic days. Yet, undeterred, Happy Things pressed on, navigating the challenges with resilience reminiscent of Israel's national spirit. Fundraising, an inherently complex task for startups, assumed a unique dimension for Happy Things. Soen, unapologetically prefacing meetings with the stark reality of potential bomb alarms, showcased the grit and determination necessary for startups navigating uncharted territories. In this moment of adversity, the global tech community's outpouring of support provided a heartening backdrop, exemplifying the strength derived from a united network. The story of Happy Things underlines not only the challenges but also the unyielding spirit and collective resilience that define Israeli founders, showcasing that, even amid turmoil, their commitment to innovation and community remains unwavering. 5 Lessons To Embody From Israeli Tech Founders Operational Resilience: Israeli founders showcase the importance of operational resilience in the face of adversity. Being prepared for unforeseen challenges and having a flexible strategy allows a startup to navigate turbulent times with resilience. Community Engagement: Actively engaging with and supporting the community during times of crisis is a lesson from Israeli founders. Whether it's contributing to civil volunteering efforts or providing essential services, fostering a strong connection with the community enhances both social impact and company reputation. Prioritizing Mental Health: Talia Soen's example highlights the significance of prioritizing mental health. In the tech sector, where work can be demanding, acknowledging and addressing the mental well-being of employees is crucial for sustaining productivity and fostering a positive work culture. Adaptability and Innovation: The Israeli tech industry's ability to adapt and innovate, even amid challenging circumstances, provides a valuable lesson. Founders should cultivate a culture of adaptability, encouraging their teams to think creatively and pivot when necessary. Global Network and Solidarity: Building a global network and fostering a sense of solidarity within the tech community is essential. The support garnered by Israeli startups from international colleagues during times of crisis demonstrates the strength derived from a connected and supportive global network. Founders should actively cultivate relationships beyond borders to navigate challenges collectively. In conclusion, In the midst of adversity, these insights from Israeli founders illuminate the roadmap for tech entrepreneurs worldwide, demonstrating that in the relentless pursuit of innovation, operational resilience becomes not just a necessity but a transformative force, capable of steering companies through the storms of uncertainty with unwavering strength and purpose."

Built by Google DeepMind — the web giant’s AI-focused lab — GraphCast looks set to revolutionize the process of predicting weather. GraphCast can forecast weather up to 10 days in advance “more accurately and much faster than the industry gold-standard weather simulation system — the High Resolution Forecast (HRES), produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),” Google DeepMindsaid in a poston Tuesday. Notably, the model can also offer earlier warnings ofextreme weather eventsand predict the movement of cyclones more accurately, giving the authorities and residents more time to prepare for damaging storms, potentially saving lives in the process. When Hurricane Lee struck eastern Canada in September, GraphCast accurately forecasted that it would make landfall in Nova Scotia nine days before it did so, while traditional forecasts only made the same prediction about six days in advance. GraphCast has been trained on four decades of weather data, enabling it to learn the cause-and-effect relationships behind Earth’s weather systems, the DeepMind team said. Remarkably, GraphCast takes less than 60 seconds to create a 10-day forecast, making it way faster than the conventional approach used by HRES, which, according to the team, “can take hours of computation in a supercomputer with hundreds of machines.” In a comparison of the two systems, GraphCast gave more accurate forecasts on more than 90% of 1,380 test variables and forecast lead times compared to HRES. “When we limited the evaluation to the troposphere, the 6- to 20-kilometer high region of the atmosphere nearest to Earth’s surface where accurate forecasting is most important, our model outperformed HRES on 99.7% of the test variables for future weather,” the team said. As the weather patterns evolve in Earth’s ever-changing climate, GraphCast will only improve as it’s fed higher-quality data. The team is open-sourcing GraphCast’s model code to give scientists and forecasters access to the technology. This will allow them to tailor it for specific weather phenomena and optimize it for different parts of the world. The ECMWF is already trying out the model. A study published by Science on Tuesdayoffers a more detailed lookat GraphCast. In it, the team says the model “should not be regarded as a replacement for traditional weather forecasting methods, which have been developed for decades, rigorously tested in many real-world contexts, and offer many features we have not yet explored,” adding that GraphCast “has potential to complement and improve the current best methods.” Still, it believes that deploying AI for weather forecasting “will benefit billions of people in their everyday lives,” explaining that alongside weather prediction, it also wants to use the technology to gain a greater understanding of the broader patterns of our climate. “By developing new tools and accelerating research, we hope AI can empower the global community to tackle our greatest environmental challenges,” it said."

Since 2018, cities in every region have ramped up their efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change.Still, the effects of climate change that are being experienced already today—more damaging storms, deadly heat waves and floods—are ""likely unprecedented over thousands of years."" They are touching everything, fromeconomic securitytohuman health, with underserved communities often harmed the most. And while no part of the country has been unscathed, few are as vulnerable to the worsening effects as the Southeast.Those are among the main findings from the Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5), a sweeping federalreportthat provides a comprehensive look at how the country is being affected by climate change and what it is doing to respond.Katherine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and one of the authors of the assessment, said ""too many people still think of climate change as an issue that's distant from us in space or time or relevance.""""[The report] shows us how—if we live in the U.S.—the risks matter, and so to do our choices,"" Hayhoe added.More than 500 authors and 260 contributors worked on this edition, including several from Georgia. The last report was released in 2018 during the Trump administration, but much has changed since then.In 2021, under President Joe Biden's administration, the U.S. re-entered the Paris Climate Agreement, the international pact that seeks to limit global warming. With the votes of Democrats in Congress, Biden also passed his signature climate and health care law—the Inflation Reduction Act—which offers billions in tax credits and incentives to help the U.S. transition toclean energy, plus funding to help communities adapt.Here's what the report says about how Georgia is faring as the planet heats up.Dangerous heat on the riseAtlanta now sees around eight more extreme heat days that it did 1961, according to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which oversaw the assessment. The city's ""heat wave season"" has also lengthened by more than 80 days.And while scientists have long known that emissions of greenhouse gases are increasing the intensity and frequency of heat waves, the report finds the Southeast is among the most vulnerable regions to these events.Underlying health issues like diabetes and heart disease are known to increase vulnerability to heat illness, and the assessment notes Southerners consistently rank among the most unhealthy in the country, with shorter-than-average life expectancies. The Southeast is also home to more Black residents than any other region of the country who ""shoulder a disproportionate level of health risk associated with climate change.""While the region has not seen a jump in days over 95 degrees like other parts of the country, it has seen an increase in nighttime temperatures. On average, the Southeast now sees almost eight more days with overnight temperatures above 70 degrees than it did between 1901 and 1960, the report found.High overnight temperatures rob the body of the cooling-off period it needs to stay safe during the day, with those living in poorly insulated homes or unhoused facing the greatest risk. Adding to the problem in heavily paved cities like Atlanta areurban heat islands, which can be as much as 12 degrees warmer than surrounding areas in a heat wave, the authors write.Evan Mallen, a senior analyst at Georgia Tech's Urban Climate Lab and a technical contributor to the assessment, said the report makes clear that heat does not affect everyone equally.""I think that when it comes to both the city and the state, we should be thinking about how we address these challenges in a way that is equitable,"" he said.More flooding on the coast—and inlandAs Earth's glaciers and ice sheets melt, the report findssea level riseis accelerating on Georgia's 100-mile-long coast and elsewhere in the Southeast.Though exact amounts vary by location, tide gauges along the Southeast coast show sea levels rose by roughly six inches between 1970 and 2020, the report finds, with a significant uptick in just the last three decades. Parts of the Southeast could face sea levels that are 16 to 23 inches higher than they were in 2000 by 2050, less than 30 years from now.As a result, the report says high-tide flooding events could become five to 10 times more common than they are today, threatening to coastal communities.Areas farther inland face a growing flood risk, too.Heavy deluges are occurring more frequently and becoming more intense, the assessment found. In the Southeast, the heaviest 1% of precipitation events now dump 37% more rain than they did in the middle of the 20th century. Only the Northeast and Midwest have seen larger increases.Those events can quickly overwhelm urban stormwater systems, just as one did in Atlanta in September, causing damaging flooding in parts of downtown.Warmer winters, failing cropsFarming is the lifeblood of many rural communities and an economic driver in Georgia, worth an estimated $74 billion of total economic impact each year.But farmers in Georgia are already having trouble bringing their crops to harvest. An exceptionally warm winter followed by a March freeze wiped out nearly all of the state's peach crop this year, and blueberry farmers have endured similar losses. Then, just over two months ago, Hurricane Idalia downed tens of thousands of pecan trees in South Georgia.Those problems—and others—are likely to grow as the planet warms, the assessment found.The report says higher temperatures, especially overnight, are already reducing farmers' yields, with impacts set to worsen as the heat increases. Long-term droughts are expected to grow more intense, and warmer conditions will allow pests to invade new areas.Pam Knox, an agricultural climatologist at UGA and one of the authors of the Southeast chapter of the report, said there is reason for hope that farmers can adjust to the changes. Modern techniques like precision farming—data-driven technologies that help farmers to use resources, like water and fertilizer, as efficiently as possible—are catching on and growing cheaper.""The more we know, the more we can figure out ways to adapt and change our management style to deal with a challenge,"" Knox said.'Hope and possibilities' existThe report does not mince words: There is not a pocket of the U.S. that has been left untouched by climate change, and the effects are likely to get worse. But how much worse depends on the actions we take today, the authors write.There are promising signs that the country and the rest of the world are making progress in the fight to reduce emissions.The price of solar panels has dropped 90% since 2010, while other clean energy technologies—from batteries to wind turbines—have gotten cheaper, too. Local efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt toclimate changeare taking place in every part of the country and have increased substantially since the last national assessment in 2018.Plus, the technologies needed to decarbonize the economy—fromelectric vehiclesandsolar powerto energy-efficient appliances and techniques to reduce food waste—already exist. With EV, battery and solar plants coming online in Georgia, the state is set to play a major role in providing those technologies to the U.S. and global markets.""The takeaway from this assessment—the takeaway from all of our collective work onclimate—should not be doom and despair,"" said Ali Zaidi, the White House's National Climate Advisor. ""The takeaway should be a sense of hope and possibilities.""2023 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Lethal heat was just one of the many ways the world's still-increasing use of fossil fuels threatens human health, according to The Lancet Countdown, a major annual assessment carried out by leading researchers and institutions. More common droughts will put millions at risk of starving, mosquitoes spreading farther than ever before will take infectious diseases with them, and health systems will struggle to cope with the burden, the researchers warned. The dire assessment comes during what is expected to be the hottest year in human history -- just last week, Europe's climate monitor declared that last month was the warmest October on record. It also comes ahead of the COP28 climate talks in Dubai later this month, which will for the first time host a ""health day"" on December 3 as experts try to shine a light on global warming's impact on health. Despite growing calls for global action, energy-related carbon emissions hit new highs last year, the Lancet Countdown report said, singling out still-massive government subsidies and private bank investments into planet-heating fossil fuels. Last year people worldwide were exposed to an average of 86 days of life-threatening temperatures, according to the Lancet Countdown study. Around 60 percent of those days were made more than twice as likely due to climate change, it said. The number of people over 65 who died from heat rose by 85 percent from 1991-2000 to 2013-2022, it added. ""However these impacts that we are seeing today could be just an early symptom of a very dangerous future,"" Lancet Countdown's executive director Marina Romanello told journalists. Under a scenario in which the world warms by two degrees Celsius by the end of the century -- it is currently on track for 2.7C -- annual heat-related deaths were projected to increase 370 percent by 2050. That marks a 4.7-fold increase. Around 520 million more people will experience moderate or severe food insecurity by mid-century, according to the projections. And mosquito-borne infectious diseases will continue to spread into new areas. The transmission of dengue would increase by 36 percent under a 2C warming scenario, according to the study. Meanwhile, more than a quarter of cities surveyed by the researchers said they were worried that climate change would overwhelm their capacity to cope. ""We're facing a crisis on top of a crisis,"" said Lancet Countdown's Georgiana Gordon-Strachan, whose homeland Jamaica is currently in the middle of a dengue outbreak. ""People living in poorer countries, who are often least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, are bearing the brunt of the health impacts, but are least able to access funding and technical capacity to adapt to the deadly storms, rising seas and crop-withering droughts worsened by global heating,"" she said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres responded to the report by saying that ""humanity is staring down the barrel of an intolerable future"". ""We are already seeing a human catastrophe unfolding with the health and livelihoods of billions across the world endangered by record-breaking heat, crop-failing droughts, rising levels of hunger, growing infectious disease outbreaks, and deadly storms and floods,"" he said in a statement. Dann Mitchell, climate hazards chair at the UK's Bristol University, lamented that ""already catastrophic"" health warnings about climate change had ""not managed to convince the world's governments to cut carbon emissions enough to avoid the first Paris Agreement goal of 1.5C"". The UN warned on Tuesday that countries' current pledges will cut global carbon emissions by just two percent by 2030 from 2019 levels -- far short of the 43 percent drop needed to limit warming to 1.5C. Romanello warned that if more progress is not made on emissions, then ""the growing emphasis on health within climate change negotiations risks being just empty words""."

But … [+3489 chars]",Food,"The number of extra homes to be protected from flooding in England has been cut by almost half. The government had committed to better protecting 336,000 more properties between 2021 and 2027. But a report by the National Audit Office (NAO) says this was reduced to 200,000, a cut of 40%, with inflation cited as the major reason. The government says it is delivering record investment in flood protection. The reduction of the pledge, made in 2020, comes despite inflation falling to its lowest rate in two years, and recent storms that have caused widespread damage and flooding across the UK. Storm Debi brought heavy rain and strong winds to several regions this week, and earlier this month Storm Ciarán lashed the UK and parts of the British Isles, causing flooding, severe damage to properties, and travel disruption. Storm Ciarán came hot on the heels of Storm Babet in October, which killed three people in the UK amid widespread flooding and disruption. The UK's public spending watchdog also said the Environment Agency had removed 500 of the 2,000 new flood defence projects originally included in the government's six-year flood and coastal erosion programme - despite the government doubling capital funding for the programme to £5.2bn. Meanwhile 203,000 properties that already have flood protection face an increased risk because of a £34m shortfall in the Environment Agency's maintenance funding for 2022-23, the report said. There was also an underspend of £310m when it came to investing in new projects during the first two years of the capital programme. The NAO warned that due to underspending in the first two years, an average of almost £1bn will need to be spent each year over the remaining four years to spend the full £5.2bn. It said this creates a risk for projects to be accelerated or new projects to be introduced too quickly, leading to delays or cost overruns, as the agency strives to meet this level of investment. The NAO recommended The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), the Environment Agency and the Treasury work together to ensure that decisions on the capital programme are focused on maximising value for money. The government has not set a target for the level of flood resilience it expects to achieve and has not mapped out any solid plans beyond 2026 to bridge the gap between its shorter-term actions and long-term objectives, the report noted. Tom Lancaster, land analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said recent storms have brought flooding to the top of the political agenda, and that the NAO's report revealed England is ""well off the pace in using the power of nature to protect homes and communities"". ""Restoring sponge-like peatlands can keep water in the hills and out of living rooms, and new woodlands and wetlands will slow the flow and absorb carbon, mitigating as well as adapting to climate change,"" he said. A Defra spokesperson said the government's priority is to make the difficult but necessary long-term decisions for the country.

The projection comes as heat-related deaths of adults over 65 have increased by 85% since the 1990s, according to the annualLancet Countdown on Health and Climate Changereport. The hottest global temperatures in over 100,000 years were recorded in 2023 with the planet currently at 1.14°C of global heating, the report says. Increasing global temperatures are linked to environmental changes like melting Arctic ice caps, drought and heat waves, and more intense hurricanes and wildfires. These stark changes are more than just ecological concerns; they also significantly impact human health, the report stressed. This new Lancet report comes the same day asthe new White House climate report, which flagged that climate-related hazards such as extreme heat, drought, and wildfires will continue to grow and directly impact human health. There were on average 86 days of health-threatening high temperatures in 2018-2022, according to the Lancet report. Human-caused climate change made more than 60% of those days more likely to have happened, the analysis showed. ""We're already seeing climate change claiming lives or livelihoods in every part of the world. The impacts are happening here and now,"" said Marina Romanello, the executive director of the Lancet Countdown and a climate change and health researcher at University College London, during a press briefing. Droughts and heatwaves are increasing globally, leading to food insecurity and water scarcity, according to the researchers. There has been a 29% increase in areas of extreme drought since the 1950s. Around 127 million more people said that they experienced significant food insecurity in 2021 than annually between 1981 and 2010. The report also warned that warming ocean temperatures are enabling the spread of the Vibrio bacteria, which can cause serious illness and death if people swim in water with open wounds or eat raw or contaminated seafood. The coastline area suitable for Vibrio bacteria around the world has increased every year by 329 square kilometers since 1982, putting around 1.4 billion more people at risk of diarrheal disease, severe wound infections and sepsis by 2022. ""Climate breakdown has begun, and humanity is staring down the barrel of an intolerable future. We are already seeing a human catastrophe unfolding with the health and livelihoods of billions across the world endangered by record-breaking heat, crop-failing droughts, rising levels of hunger, growing infectious disease outbreaks, and deadly storms and floods,"" said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres in response to the Lancet report. The Paris Agreement, the international treaty on climate change, calls for the world to keep global warming to well below 2-degrees Celsius, with the aim of limiting the increase to 1.5-degrees Celsius. The new report found that under the 2-degree warming scenario, there would be 525 million additional people experiencing significant food insecurity by 2031-2060. There would be 23–39% more cases of infection with Vibrio bacteria under the 2-degree warming scenario. There would also be a 37% increase in the spread of dengue, a mosquito-borne illness that can be life threatening, the report says. ""Continued warming could lead to those patterns spiraling out of control,"" Romanello said to the projections outlined in the report. The researchers behind the report say that there needs to be urgent action on climate change to mitigate the health impacts.

It should be a proud moment for the cricket-mad country, where informal matches sprout up in parks, lanes and fields at all hours of the day, and the sport’s stars are among the country’s biggest celebrities. Unfortunately, suffocating air pollution in several host cities, including Delhi, has caused practices to be canceled and some players to rely on inhalers.

Over the last two years, record heat has seared the regions — from Pakistan to Thailand — and the heat waves are projected to continue. Individuals and entities ranging from the former prime minister of Grenada (a cricket-loving nation) to the Royal Challengers Bangalore of the Indian Premier League (who donned green jerseys in 2022 to bring attention to scorching temperatures) have called attention to cricket’s climate crisis and called for action. Playing the game in the warming climate inhibits safety and productivity — similar to other jobs. One Day Internationals, or ODIs, the form of cricket played during the World Cup, can last up to eight hours. In India, temperatures during the latter part of the game’s season can exceed 100 degrees, and — over even short periods — heighten the risk of heat stroke and other ailments. Cricket batsmen encased in helmets and padding are at even greater risk. Meanwhile, greater levels of precipitation and other extreme weather events are wreaking other sorts of havoc. Unlike rugby and soccer, cricket isn’t played in the rain. So, as the rain increases, so do match disruptions. In England, for example, the rate of rain-affected matches has more than doubled since 2011. The effect on cricket facilities is also extreme. In South Africa, drought is affecting water available for irrigation of cricket grounds; in England, increased heat and precipitation encourages the growth of damaging fungus. In each case, costs go up and — equally important — the nature of the game changes as players adjust to wetter or drier conditions. Of course, no organized cricket league or team can slow or halt climate change. But they can make efforts to reduce safety issues related to heat by rescheduling matches and seasons for cooler parts of the year and allowing athletes to wear shorts instead of traditional trousers. Associations and leagues must continue to focus on embracing sustainability initiatives that aim at carbon-neutral facilities and operations and ensure that all partnerships, including advertising, equipment contracts and broadcasting, prioritize sustainability first. An IPL partnership with Saudi Arabia is incompatible with those goals. In recent years, the Middle East’s biggest oil producer has actively pushed back on efforts to reduce fossil fuel use, going so far as to block a call for the world to burn less oil at last year’s climate summit in Egypt.

As nomadic pastoralists, they keep domestic animals and move with them to seek fresh pastures—often selling some of their livestock for meat.Although nomadic pastoralism has sustained these populations for millennia, it faces mounting pressures from deteriorating environments, shrinking rangelands, and new generations who seek a less grueling and tenuous life. At the same time, pastoralism is modernizing, with groups leveraging new technology to better care for their animals.But the practice has survived for so long because it is designed to adapt to a changing environment—pastoralists move with their animals to find fresh pasture and water, leaving behind fallow land to heal and regrow. ""The broad view is that having mobile animals enables you to leave places that are overused or that have scarce water orfood resourcesand move to places where there are more resources,"" said Forrest Fleischman, who researches natural resource policy at the University of Minnesota. ""And that means you're not going to hammer the one place you're stuck in.""Experts say it is a lesson that could help those who raise livestock at much larger scales adapt and reduce the impact of animal agriculture on the environment.

It's a cultural identity that connects generations across time. And at its heart is the human connection to animals.Agvaantogtokh and his family sell animals for meat. They also sell dairy products such as yogurt and hard cheeses. While they consider the animals their property, they also see them as living beings working alongside them for a common purpose.Researchers say herders believe in ""animal agency.""

When Agvaantogtokh thinks about climate change, he worries about what it means for humans and livestock.One spring day, he felt the wind whip up and watched blue skies turn menacingly dark. In the distance, he spotted a wall of dirt rushing toward him.""Dust storm,"" he muttered. His father, Lkhaebum, left a bowl of soup half-eaten on the table. Both set off on motorbikes to make sure their animals were safe.""We need more rain,"" said Lkhaebum, who like other Mongolians uses only his given name. ""If the grass isn't growing, it is very challenging for us.""Chronic drought plagues Mongolia. So does warming. Since 1940, the country's government says,average temperatureshave risen 2.2 degrees Celsius (nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit)—a measure that may seem small, but for global averages, scientists say every tenth of a degree matters, and a warming world brings more weather extremes.A sandstorm covers a railway track in Sainshand, east of Gobi desert, in Mongolia, May 19, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/Manish SwarupAnd dzuds—natural disastersunique to Mongolia caused by droughts and severe, snowy winters—have grown harsher and more frequent and can keep livestock from accessing water or food.A dzud pushed Agvaantogtokh and his family to move out of a southwestern province after a disastrous winter killed 400 of their animals. They've been in the eastern province of Sukhbaatar since 2020.The family lives simply. They have a sink with a rubber pump to limit water use. They live in a tent called a ger, which has wooden circular frames insulated with sheepskin and felt, and doors facing east to let in the morning sun.Nurmaa, who married into this way of life, uses a boiler fired with horse dung to cook and stay warm.""Year by year,"" she said, ""I have learned a lot of things.""

""One of the main difficulties related to pastoralism is the lack of grazing,"" Ndiaye said. ""The livestock are hungry, and you sometimes have trouble selling one because it is so thin.""""Many varieties of tree have disappeared, and even our children are unaware of certain species,"" Ba said. ""The best varieties of grass no longer grow in certain areas, and the most widespread grass is more like rubber: It fills the belly but doesn't nourish the animals.""Lkhaebum holds his cap as a sudden dust storm swirls outside his ger in the Munkh-Khaan region of the Sukhbaatar district, in southeast Mongolia, Saturday, May 13, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/Manish SwarupMeals for Ndiaye's family rarely include meat and are carefully planned. Only when they pass through certain villages can they stock up on food—vegetables, rice and other essentials.Overall, per-person meat consumption in Senegal is among the lowest in the world; rates are more than six times higher in Mongolia.Ndiaye's family doesn't sell their animals regularly because meat is mostly for special occasions: weddings, or holidays such as Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr. When they do, a few head of cattle can provide enough money to get married, buy rice or even emigrate.The family has the same deep respect for their animals that Mongolian pastoralists do. Ba is especially drawn to the sheep. He's noticed that the rams cry when they move away from him, remember the names he gives them and come when they're called.""It's a real friendship,"" Ba said.Herder Agvaantogtokh saddles a horse for his wife, Nurmaa, in preparation for a 24-kilometer (15-mile) journey with their livestock to a new location in the Munkh-Khaan region of the Sukhbaatar district, in southeast Mongolia, Sunday, May 14, 2023.

In another, baby sheep too young to walk for long in the heat are bound together with netting.Ba said he can't imagine any other life: ""A village without cows has no soul.""ANCIENT PRACTICE, NEW TECHNIQUESTo keep their practice alive, pastoralists around the world are looking for ways to modernize.In Mongolia, Lkhaebum recently began using a motorbike to more easily search for horses, which are never kept fenced. One nippy morning, his calf-length tunic billowed around him as he began a search, stopping occasionally to peer through binoculars toward a herd grazing on a faraway hill.The family also has a solar-powered battery that runs a television and washing machine, a karaoke machine, and a cellphone to keep track of weather and access Facebook groups where herders exchange information.Goats and sheep run towards a water point before undertaking a 24-kilometer (15-mile) journey to a new location in the Munkh-Khaan region of the Sukhbaatar district, in southeast Mongolia, Sunday, May 14, 2023.

""It really helps us a lot with communicating with our children because they're far away.""Their 18-year-old daughter studies medicine in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar. Their twoyounger children, a 13-year-old son and a 9-year-old daughter, are in school. The son spoke about becoming a herder when he was in his early teens. But not anymore.""I won't regret anything if my child won't be a herder,"" Nurmaa said. ""I would like them to do what they aspire to do.""Her view is not unusual.""If you asked parents, very few of them want their children to grow up to be pastoralists,"" professor Wangui said. ""They want their children to be something else because they're seeing the life of pastoralists is a tough life.""Nurmaa, the wife of herder Agvaantogtokh, packs her belongings to move to a new location in the Munkh-Khaan region of the Sukhbaatar district, in southeast Mongolia, Monday, May 15, 2023. Every time the family moves its ger, each belonging is systematically placed in the same spot — something stable and predictable in a world of constant change. Credit: AP Photo/Manish SwarupKEEPING UP IN A CHANGING WORLDThough modern tools promise to make things easier, many pastoralists run into obstacles. Those in Senegal, for example, often struggle to find signals for their cell phones. They rely mostly on older technology and methods.One evening, Ndiaye's grown daughter, Houraye, peeled onions for the family's meal, stirring a pot of rice illuminated by the glowing embers of her fire. When it was ready, her seven relatives gathered under the stars with small flashlights and turned on the handheld radio they charge off their solar panel. The bleating of sheep nearly drowned out the traditional melodies.An important advancement in infrastructure has helped the family: water towers known as forages that have sprung up with government assistance. Previously, finding water could require a 35-kilometer (22-mile) trek. Now, the family plots trips along the path of these towers, where they can refill their jugs and replenish their animals in long troughs.Still, some leaders don't offer help to pastoralists. Conflicts between herders and settled farmers also can erupt surrounding land use and access to water.A family photograph of herder Agvaantogtokh, his wife, Nurmaa, and their children hangs in their ger along with a teddy bear and some books in the Munkh-Khaan region of the Sukhbaatar district, in southeast Mongolia, Saturday, May 13, 2023. “I won’t regret anything if my child won’t be a herder,” Nurmaa says. “I would like them to do what they aspire to do.” Credit: AP Photo/Manish SwarupA few advocacy groups advise pastoralists to choose settled lives for their own good. In Senegal's Sahel region—where the United Nations estimates 65% of meat and 70% of milk sold at local markets come from pastoralists—the head of the Association for Promoting Livestock Farming in the Sahel and Savannah suggests people put their children in school and diversify incomes.""Climate change has caused enormous damage, and people are not aware of the dangers that lie ahead,"" said Moussa Demba Assette Ba. ""If you invest all your income in livestock and disaster strikes, you lose everything, and that's what climate change can do.""The former pastoralist built a home in 2006 that has since turned into a sprawling compound that provides solar power to neighbors. He encourages others to settle down as he has and seek ways to increase the quality, not quantity, of their animals.But perhaps the biggest threat to pastoralism comes from within, as the next generation chooses other paths.Four of Ndiaye's seven living children don't travel with their parents. He relies on help from Ba and a paid family friend to direct the animals to their destination.Lkhaebum, left, with his daughter-in-law, Nurmaa, right, and others shelter inside their ger during a sudden dust storm in the Munkh-Khaan region of the Sukhbaatar district, in southeast Mongolia, Saturday, May 13, 2023.

Pascal is … [+2882 chars]",YouTube,"The Last of Us Across entertainment sites late yesterday, word spread that Pedro Pascal was reportedly about to sign a contract to play Reed Richards in Marvel’s Fantastic Four film. Pascal is not a name that’s really come up in a year or so of rumors, first it was John Krasinski, the Penn Badgely, then Adam Driver, then recently Jake Gyllenhaal who is reported to have been “too expensive.” So now we have Pedro Pascal, who may indeed be the final pick. I…don’t love it. Don’t get me wrong, I do love Pedro Pascal, but at this point, it feels like he’s a bit overexposed and maybe that he’s getting picked just because of how much he’s been surfing around high profile projects. He’s been the star of the most popular Disney Plus series, The Mandalorian, and he’s also the star of HBO’s most popular series, The Last of Us. Now, he maybe the star of the MCU’s most anticipated upcoming film. Reed Richards It feels too safe. And again, Pascal is great, both as an actor and a human, it seems, but there is something about this that just doesn’t feel right given how much we’ve seen him and that really, I don’t think he fits the part that well. There are rumors that this version of Fantastic Four will exist in a world where Reed and Sue already have kids, and there are jokes that Pascal will have to escort a special child somewhere in the film, as he’s done in TLOU and Mando. The other rumored, imminent picks for the other three members of the team feel more on point. I am 100% behind the idea of Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, both looks-wise and acting-wise. She feels perfect. The other, less verifiable rumors are Stranger Things’ Joeseph Quinn as Johnny Storm and The Bear’s Ebon-Moss Bacharach as Ben Grimm. I have no issue with either of those, though I did laugh at a Twitter comment I saw about Quinn’s face being “too British.” Vanessa Kirby at the AFI Fest screening of ""The Son"" held at TCL Chinese Theatre on November 5, 2022 ... [+] in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images) The Pedro Pascal discussion has brought up some nostalgia about just how well the original Reed Richards, Ioan Gruffudd, was cast in those old films. He really was, but I doubt he’d have the star power Marvel wants to see for the return of the character. My personal pick that I think would have been the best is You’s Penn Badgley, but that apparently was not in the cards. Besides Pascal, I don’t think I would have liked Krasinski, Drive or Gyllenhaal either. Maybe Driver, but after Star Wars, I wouldn’t blame him for not wanting to get back on the Disney train. So, this is not confirmed yet, but it may be shortly. Given that Mando requires more or less just voice acting and Pascal’s tenure on The Last of Us is…fairly short going forward, I think he’ll certainly have the time (he’s also starring in Ridley Scott’s Gladiator 2!), but yeah, I don’t know, while I love Pascal, I don’t love the pick. Follow me on Twitter, Threads, YouTube, and Instagram. Pick up my sci-fi novels the Herokiller series and The Earthborn Trilogy."

Shami, who won the Player of the Match award for derailing New Zealand's pursuit, said he had been waiting for this opportunity for a long time. Kohli's 'Virat' show at the Wankhede Stadium followed by Shami's lethal 7-wicket haul powered India to the final of ICC World Cup 2023, beating New Zealand by 70 runs in a mouth-watering semifinal clash on Wednesday. Daryl Mitchell's vigilant knock of 134 runs came up short against Shami's lethal spell as the India pacer led India's effort in the field to help the hosts seal a place in Sunday's final. ""I was waiting for my chances. I didn't play a lot of white-ball cricket. My return started against New Zealand [in Dharamsala]. We talk a lot of variations, but I still believe in pitching it up and getting wickets with the new ball,"" Shami said in a post-match presentation. Shami dropped in-form New Zealand captain Kane Williamson's catch, which could have been a major talking point, but he quickly returned and sent the Kiwi skipper packing. ""I dropped Williamson's catch, I shouldn't have. I felt terrible. But the focus was to try and take pace off, see if they're hitting it in the air. It was a chance we had to take [with the variations]. The wicket was very good, lots of runs were scored in the afternoon. There was some fear of dew, the grass had been shaved off from the wicket. If dew was there, it skids on and there's a chance runs could've been made. It feels amazing [this kind of performance]. Last two World Cups, we lost [in the semifinals]. Who knows when or if we'll get a chance, so we wanted to do everything for this, one chance we didn't want to let go,"" he added. Shami also made history as he registered the best wickets by an Indian bowler in World Cup history. Shami finished with supreme figures of 7/57, making him the tournament's highest wicket-taker, with 24 from six games at a breathtaking average of 9.13.

It's time to look beyond the status quo and considernature-based solutionsto protect the places we love.How we got hereIn many parts of the world, humans have long felt astrong connection to the coast. Wewrite stories, sing songs and build liveson the lands that touch the sea. We also build walls and other concrete, stone and metal structures toprotect those landsfrom the very seas we revere.From time immemorial, Indigenous Peoples made their homes along the coasts, becomingexperts in their knowledgeof coastal ecosystems and, on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, usedsalt marshes for food and transportation. Following European settlement, those salt marshes were drained,dykeswere built from earth and wood, and the land was cultivated for agriculture.Over time, other hard armor structuressuch asrevetmentsandbreakwaterswere constructed to block wave energy and provide additional protection for agriculture, transportation and growing cities.Where we are nowToday, Canada's coastal infrastructure includes extensive networks of seawalls, dykes, revetments and breakwaters, most of which are made ofhard materials. Hard coastal infrastructure is everywhere if you know where to look. TheCanso Causewayconnecting Cape Breton Island to mainland Nova Scotia and theVancouver seawallare just two examples.In some cases, usinghard infrastructureis unavoidable. Indeed,hard infrastructureis critical for maintaining transportation and energy infrastructure, including roads, railroads and ports.However, hard infrastructure almost alwaysincreases erosionin adjacent areas, is expensive to maintain and degrades over time. Engineers predict that repairs, includingraising the dykes along the Chignecto Isthmusbetween New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, will cost between $189 and $300 million.With such an astronomical price tag, even smaller projects are simply not an option for many municipalities or individual landowners.In the face of such challenges, there are opportunities to adapt engineering and protective infrastructure to be more sustainable by integratingnatural elementsand processes.Nature-based solutionsNature-based approachespreserve or reintroduce natural structures and materials into the environment, recognizing and respectingnatural systemsand their benefits for humans.Nature-based approaches range from those that are entirely natural to hybrid solutions, which incorporate traditional hard engineering with natural features.Examples of nature-based solutionsincludedyke realignment to restore natural water flow and allow saltmarsh reestablishment, wetland and dune restoration, and living shorelines which utilize plants, sand and rock to protect the coast.Nature-based approaches can involvereserving land for natural systems by protecting them from developmentand making room for the evolution of natural systems; they can alsoinvolve moving back from the coast, and releasing land back to nature.Hard infrastructure weakens over time while nature-based solutions grow stronger as plants establish roots, biodiversity increases and natural processes adjust.Nature-based solutions provide a wide array of benefits. In addition to protecting coastal places from flooding, storm surges and erosion. Nature-based solutionsprevent shoreline pollution,support biodiversity, canincrease property valueand contribute to overallhuman well-being.Incorporating nature-based solutions requires innovation and open-mindedness that may feel intimidating and it is ofteneasier to trust a stone or concrete wallover the energy absorbing power of plants and soil.As such,raising awarenessabout different nature-based options and being transparent aboutcosts and benefitscan help build confidence in nature-based solutions.Successful nature-based solutions also require place-basedcollaboration and knowledge sharingbetween impacted peoples, engineers, scientists and decision-makers that consider social and ecological interests.Nature-based solutions cannot be prescribed as top-down interventions. Every situation is unique, and many people with diverse knowledge and perspectives should come together to decide how specific nature-based approaches can meet various infrastructure, ecological and social needs as well as increase flood resilience.What now?Fornatural resourceand permitting agencies, as well as many property owners, the tradition of building hard armored shorelines remains deeply ingrained. Current guidance documents, policies and habits were built for hard infrastructure. In some cases,bureaucratic decision-making structuresmove slower than hazards from flooding.In other cases, including lack of or delayed implementation of legislation, such asthe Coastal Protection Actand regulations in Nova Scotia,political interestshinder planning actions that would limit hard infrastructure and development along the coast.An overview of the problems of erosion facing many communities across Canada, particularly in the North. Credit: CBCMany Canadiansare buying homes in areas with high flood risk. The infrastructure they rely upon isagingand requires adaptation. Infrastructure supportingbridges, roadsandrail linesneeds to be upgraded or removed, providing opportunities to incorporate nature-based solutions.Hope for the futureAs we look towards what can feel like an ominous future, there are many resources for individuals or organizations seeking additional information and guidance about nature-based solutions.TransCoastal Adaptations: Center for Nature-based Solutionsis a practitioner, academic and government partnership in Nova Scotia focused on restoration, managed realignment and climate change adaptation.Privately owned companies, also in Nova Scotia,Helping Heal NatureandCB Wetlands and Environmental Specialists, focus on ecological restoration, living shorelines and community stewardship and education. Nation-widecommunities of practiceexist to build capacity for natural and nature-based approaches.As more people learn about nature-based solutions, there will be more opportunities to incorporate natural process into coastal protection. We know the stakes, and we have nature-based solutions at hand. It's time to give dirt and plants a chance."

Notably, the limited theoretical understanding of tropical cyclogenesis makes scheme uncertainty a predominant factor in all future periods.The dual impact of global warming, creating both hostile dynamic environments and favorable thermodynamic conditions for tropical cyclone formation, adds complexity to projections based on different identification schemes.The research emphasizes the urgency of addressing these uncertainties and identifies the need to enhance tropical cyclone identification and simulation techniques in climate models. The findings stress that improved predictive capabilities will not only refine climate adaptation strategies but also fortify resilience incoastal regionsvulnerable to the devastating impacts of tropical storms.In the face of climate change, this study calls for collective efforts to unlock the mysteries of tropical cyclone behavior, paving the way for more accurate projections and proactive measures to safeguard communities and ecosystems."

Most peoplewill be driving for the holiday makingroads congested, especially on Nov. 22, according to data from AAA. But another4.7 million peopleare also expected to fly out of their local airports during the holiday travel period. To ensure that people are making the most of their holiday and getting to their destinations as planned, experts say people should plan proactively. “For many Americans, Thanksgiving and travel go hand in hand, and this holiday, we expect more people on the roads, skies, and seas compared to 2022,”saidPaula Twidale, senior vice president of AAA Travel. TIME spoke to experts about how to prepare for Thanksgiving travel. Here’s what they said. Some49 million Americansare driving to see family and loved ones for the holiday. With so many people behind the wheel, experts say it is important to schedule a quick car service before making the trip. “Make sure your tires are properly inflated, your fluid is topped off, and your battery is in good shape. Now is the time to do that because you don't want to have something that could have been fixed with routine maintenance go wrong while you're on the road,” says AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross. Data from AAAsuggeststhat people should hit the road before 11:00 a.m. if they are planning to travel the day before Thanksgiving. Families who live 100 miles or less from the Thanksgiving hosts can also opt to travel that same Thursday if it's before 10:00 a.m. to avoid traffic. When returning from the holiday weekend, AAA research shows that streets are busiest between 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. You can check the peak congestion times of major U.S. cities like New York and Seattle,here. Gross adds that people should pack snacks and an emergency kit in the car to avoid unnecessarily stopping. “If you don't have to pull over to grab something to eat, that will probably help,” he says. Travelers should make sure to check for possible weather hazards days in advance in case it would be better to leave earlier or later than expected. A newAccuweather reportforecasts a large storm across the central and eastern U.S. that is scheduled to hit on Tuesday and could pose a problem for travelers. ""A storm will develop along a slow-moving cold front and will produce moderate to heavy rain from the Ohio and Tennessee valleys to the East Coast…,"" saidAccuweather long-range expert Paul Pastelok. The storm is expected to last until Wednesday, and could cause flight cancellations or extend travel time in several metro areas—including Atlanta, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. Disruptive weather should subside by Black Friday,experts say, making the return home much easier. Jo Franco, a well-known travel influencer, suggests people flying figure out their “security strategy” before arriving at the airport. That can look like enrolling in programs such as TSA Precheck or Clear to help save time, although wait times for these services are still going to take longer than usual during the holiday. She also says others can ease the security process by abiding by guidelines that can befound here, to avoid an additional security check for your luggage. Gross says that people can also save time by reserving airport parking ahead of time if need be. He adds that those who are traveling for a shorter amount of time should avoid checking a bag, if possible. Downloading their airline’s app to be notified of any last-minute gate changes, delays or cancellations is also helpful. Since Thanksgiving is swiftly approaching, Franco notes flights will be limited and pricier. For those booking last-minute flights, the best option may be to mix and match different airlines. “Look at flying out with one airline and back with another or out of one airport and back into another. Comparing and contrasting dates, providers, departure airports and destinations will enable you to find the best deal available for your needs,” Laura Lindsay, Skyscanner travel editor,says. Priceline data shared with TIME shows that flights cost less on the actual day of Thanksgiving. Travelers who extend their weekend and return between Nov. 27-30 can save nearly 30% on domestic flights, when compared to traveling on Sunday, Nov. 26. If you are really on a tight budget, consider alternatives to flying like a bus or train. Tickets may appear more expensive, but Franco says people should remember that transportation to and from the airport is an additional cost. “It might look cheaper to fly somewhere,” she says, but things might change “when you factor in the stress of airport travel and the expensive ubers to the airports.” But ultimately, experts say that whatever mode of transportation you take, be aware that any trip will be longer than usual. “Thanksgiving, it's kind of viewed as an obligatory holiday. It's intensely family oriented,” says Gross. “It's probably the busiest holiday of the year.”"

[+] GO WITH ""Feature: Czechs cut back on Christmas as inflation bites"" (Photo by Deng Yaomin/Xinhua via Getty Images) Best Places To Travel In December There are several options that should be on your radar if you plan on traveling in December. Whether you want warmer weather or want to take in the cold, below you’ll find a few destinations that can suit your travel goals. Mexico can be one of the best places to visit, thanks to warmer weather and the dryer climate, especially in the southern and central regions (though you won’t need a heavy parka if you want to visit the north). Hurricane season is also usually over by the beginning of December, so a visit to the Mexican coasts is safe. Additionally, Mexico is not only close, but it is also cheaper than other warm-weather destinations. However, if you plan on visiting one of the more popular Mexican resorts, note that it will likely be crowded, and prices may be up as many people visit during the winter season. If you don’t mind a little cold, Mexico City is a good place to visit during the Christmas season, especially the downtown area, if you want to take in the decorations and see what Mexico’s largest city has to offer. There are plenty of indoor activities, such as museums and cheap restaurants, to explore. If you’re set on visiting the beach, a visit to Puerto Escondido is a good place to consider, as it can be a bit cheaper, has plenty of activities in the surrounding areas, and can be a great place to surf or even go whale watching in December. If you want to visit a place that looks like it came out of a fairy tale, don’t mind the cold, and want to see holiday decor, a visit to Prague might be the place you’re looking for. Prague will be cold during this time of year, with the possibility of snow, but it also adds to the coziness and charm of a warm meal in a local restaurant. Rain is not so common during the winter months. The city is walkable, on the cheaper side compared to other parts of Europe, and is safe. The architecture includes the largest castle in the world, Gothic cathedrals, baroque buildings, a walkable bridge lined with statues, and the infamous Astronomical Clock. There are also beautiful Christmas markets to stroll through where visitors can try various pastries and warm drinks like mulled wine and hot chocolate. You may also want to visit Karlovy Vary, a spa town with 13 main springs and about 300 smaller hot springs to enjoy. A bus ride from Prague to the town is the easiest way to visit. If Czechia sounds great but is a bit too far, Quebec City might be a better option that is closer to home. Quebec City is also going to be a (very) cold destination with several Christmas markets and plenty of decor to take in. It is generally not too touristy around December, so prices may be lower. The architecture in Quebec City is also something to marvel at, with unique buildings in the Old Quebec area. Old Quebec is also very walkable, which allows travelers to explore at their own pace. Quebec City also has winter activities that include skiing, skijoring, kaléidoscopes, and even a visit to an ice hotel. There is also the Quebec City Winter Carnival with food, snow sculptures, and rides. If you plan on staying until the New Year, be sure to partake in the New Year's Eve in Québec City (Toboggan) activities. You may also plan to visit Montmorency Falls (larger than Niagra Falls), which is less than 30 minutes away from Old Quebec City. Also near Old Quebec City is the Mont-Sainte-Anne ski resort, which has plenty to offer in the winter. If you want a warm city escape without traveling internationally, Florida may be your answer. With hurricane season usually ending on November 30, Florida is likely going to be safer from weather disruptions. Miami is one of the top destinations, thanks to a variety of activities to partake in. You may want to visit No Vacancy, Miami Beach, the public art exhibition that runs through mid-December. There are also plenty of light shows to enjoy during the holiday season. Football fans may want to get tickets to the Dallas Cowboys vs. Miami Dolphins game, which is set to take place on Christmas Eve. There is also the Capital One Orange Bowl football game on December 30. The Florida Keys, Fort Lauderdale, and Everglades National Park are all within reach of Miami. Additionally, if you want a more tropical location, you can visit Bimini, Bahamas, which is only two hours by boat. Why Are These The Best? The destinations above all have plenty to offer, are relatively safe, and have interesting activities within reach. They are also somewhat less crowded. What Are Notable Things To Do/Places To See Here? All of the destinations above have much to offer in regards to entertainment. They all have their own versions of winter activities that are unique to this time of year. Additionally, they are not far from other, less popular, and less expensive destinations. Why Is December A Good Month To Visit? December is a great time to visit because of the charm and unique perspective that these destinations offer to travelers. Aside from the cold and possibility of snow, they are also drier with less rainfall during these times of the year. Summary December can be a great time to travel if you want to enjoy winter activities and festive decorations. These destinations have plenty to explore and aren’t as expensive as some other popular destinations. They are also relatively safe to travel to. Related Articles:"

The couple showed ABC News' meteorologist Rob Marciano the spot where their home used to be, now an empty lot covered in sea lavender and some shards of their former life. ""If we would have got paid by insurance the right amount of money, it would have been a you would have been standing in a new house,"" Harry Appel said. ""Insurance was tough — that was worse than a storm."" In September 2017, Hurricane Irma barrelled across the Atlantic with winds reaching 185 miles per hour — the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, according to theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Category 4 storm ravaged the Appel's dream home, along with much of the region, leaving those hit hardest by the storm to contend with an insurance market already struggling to cover its claims. Since moving into their home in Big Pine Key in 2015, the Appels paid into premium homeowner insurance policies — theNational Flood Insurance Programprovided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""A week afterward, the guy came up from Texas — the underwriter for flood insurance for FEMA — and he came up and he looked at the house and for him to write a check on the spot for this entire policy, which was amazing. And at that point, I really felt better,"" Harry Appel said. Harry Appel told ABC News that FEMA paid out the $110,000 flood policy, but when the private insurance company responsible for the Appels' wind coverage came to assess the damage, they claimed the damage had only been done by flooding, so the company wasn't liable. ""We were entitled to this money,"" Jen Appel said. ""This was a contractual obligation that they did not live up to and it should have been paid."" Home insurance isn't mandatory by law, but banks often require homeowners to get insurance as a condition of a mortgage. ""The insurer's goal is to collect more in premiums than they pay out in claims,"" said Ben Keys, University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business professor of real estate and finance. ""We're seeing higher costs of materials, higher costs of labor, and those are growing faster than inflation."" In recent decades, the intensity of some hurricanes has exploded, fueled by the warming seas, according to experts. ""We're having more disasters, we're having more costly disasters, and importantly, more people live in harm's way,"" Keys said. ""So any individual disaster now leads to more payouts coming from the insurers — and they're recognizing that these costs are rising quickly, not just because of inflation, and they're reacting accordingly."" 2023 marked the most ""billion dollar disasters"" on record for the United States, with25 climate-related disasters, according to NOAA. As these events have gotten more costly, some of the largest private insurance companies, like Farmers, have left states like Florida entirely. Still, other companies have gone insolvent due to the increasing cost of claims, leaving a market with fewer options for residents to choose from. Three-fourths of Florida's 21.5 million residents live in coastal counties, according to theInsurance Information Institute, and it was Hurricane Andrew in 1992 that first exposed the vulnerabilities of the private insurance market in the state. In the aftermath of Andrew, Florida created a last-resort state-run program calledCitizens Property Insurance Corporationwith the mission of insuring homeowners who can't otherwise find coverage. ""We've seen a number of large insurers go belly up, and in response, we've seen a lot of homeowners who are now dependent on the state's public insurance plan. So Citizens Property Insurance is now the largest homeowner's insurer in the state,"" Keys said. ""And what that points to is a private insurance market that's simply not working."" Florida is just one of 32 states and the District of Columbia that offers a state-run FAIR (Fair Access to Insurance Requirements) plan. Another of the 32, Louisiana, is struggling with some of the same issues. Keys explained that sea level rise and more severe flooding after storms, ""have continued to drive up costs for homeowners in that state."" Tammy and Charles Guillory and their daughter Caylee lived inside the cramped quarters of an RV parked in their driveway for two years during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic after their home was hit byHurricanes Lauraand Delta in 2020. ""Some days I didn't know how we was gonna make it, but we made it,"" Tammy Guillory said. ""It was hard."" After the one-two punch of the hurricanes, just six weeks apart, the Guillorys turned to their insurance companies to pay out their policies. ""We did what we were supposed to do on our end of the bargain,"" Tammy Guillory said. ""Now it's time for them to do what they are supposed to do."" To have their policy paid, the Guillorys had to take their unmet claim to the courts. They won their case, but the insurer appealed, so the family had to wait even longer. ""I was a client of this company for over 20 years with no missed payments — nothing,"" Charles Guillory said. ""But when it's time for us to be able to receive, we have to go through this, and I don't think it's right."" Attorney Michael Cox represented the Guillorys, along with hundreds of similar cases in the area. ""When you have this massive catastrophe, I think the insurance companies came in and they know statistically that most people will just walk away with the mistreatment — and they did,"" Cox said. ""Most people won't fight like Charles and Tammy fought. They stood up for themselves and they were willing to go all the way to bat with this company."" While the Guillorys eventually won their case, the story across the state doesn't always have a happy ending. Louisiana still has the third highest insurance premiums in the country,according to III. The market has been deteriorating since the state was hit by record hurricane activity in 2020, causing upwards of $23 billion in damage. In the aftermath of the disasters, 12 insurers were declared insolvent because of their losses during that time and another 12 voluntarily withdrew from the state. Over the last two years, Louisiana's state-run insurance plan — Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corp. — more than tripled the number of policies it carries, from 35,000 to 128,000, according to theLouisiana Department of Insurance. ""The drama in Louisiana was that the state insurance regulator increased premiums by 65% earlier this year for the state-run plan,"" Keys said. ""And that was a recognition that they simply didn't have enough capital on hand to weather an even moderate storm."" The state government approved a $45 million fund in February of this year to help stabilize the market. Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon says it's a first step to court companies to come back to the state. ""That's a balance between the obligation we have to make insurance available, to attract companies and the obligation we have to make them responsive and fair with their policyholders,"" Donelon said. Reinsurance often creates another kink in the chain. ""Reinsurance is most easily thought of as insurance for insurance companies,"" Keys explained. ""So insurance companies are going to take on risky policies from homeowners all over the country, and they're going to have a portfolio of risk, and they'd like to protect themselves from the worst case scenarios."" As natural disasters become more costly around the country, the cost to stay for reinsurers is also increasing. ""They have a lot of influence in the decisions that insurers make,"" Keys said. ""They have invested heavily in climate modeling and they have some of the best data and the best models out there. And because this is the only business that they do, they have a lot of money at stake."" As insurance issues continue across the Gulf Coast, some have looked to fortifying their homes to withstand these powerful storms as a possible solution. At the University of Miami, researchers are testing how to fortify homes with their hurricane simulator, showing us that the way homes are built could be one key to reversing the insurance market retreat. ""Insurance companies, as well as reinsurance, rely heavily on numerical models,"" UMiami assistant scientist Milan Curcic said. ""How likely is it that certain areas will experience wind of this threshold, flooding of this level, and so on."" While some can afford to fortify their homes and choose to self-insure, Keys said those who can't should ""shop around"" for policies. As for the Appels, they settled for a fraction of their policy payout after two years of litigation and being forced into escrow with their bank. They now live in their bed and breakfast and have given up on rebuilding their home. ""When we don't have a mortgage here, there will be no insurance here,"" Jen Appel said. ""So I'm joining the ranks with self-insuring, really self-insuring — don't just say you're going to self-insure. You better have a bankroll."" While Harry is ready to move away, Jen says she doesn't want to go. ""The only reason we're still here is because I don't want to go,"" Jen Appel said. ""But I didn't go through all that to get to this point where I haven't enjoyed any of it."""

The streets of Aizawl wore a deserted look as people stayed indoors and only a few vehicles were seen on roads. District administrations and district disaster management authorities in notices asked people to be alert and take precautionary measures against any eventuality that can be caused due to the rain. The state is likely to experience heavy rainfall till Saturday. The IMD forecast 51 mm of rain between the mornings of November 17 and 18 in Aizawl district. There are forecasts of heavy rain also in districts such as Champhai (52 mm), Kolasib (58 mm), Lawngtlai (52 mm) and Mamit (56 mm). The cyclonic storm will be moving past the Sunderbans before making landfall on the Bangladesh coast with a maximum wind speed of 80 kmph during Friday night or early morning of Saturday morning, it said.

The cyclonic storm 'Midhili' will cross the Bangladesh coast on November 17 night or early hours of November 18, it said. The Met department on Friday warned fishermen not to venture into the sea in north Bay of Bengal and along and off West Bengal coasts till November 18. The deep depression existing over north Bay of Bengal intensified into cyclonic storm Midhili as it moved in a north-northeaster ward direction, lying 200 km south-southeast of the seaside resort town of Digha in West Bengal and 220 km southeast of Khepupara in Bangladesh on Friday morning, the Met said. ""It is likely to continue to move north-northeastwards and cross Bangladesh coast close to Khepupara with wind speed of 60-70 kmph gusting to 80 kmph during November 17 night or early hours of November 18,"" the IMD said. The name 'Midhili' was given by the Maldives. Countries affected by the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal cyclones rotationally give names of cyclones in a sequence. The Met department warned fishermen not to venture into the sea in north Bay of Bengal and along and off West Bengal coasts till Saturday. The IMD said the cyclone Midhili will have no major impact on Odisha as it passes above 150 kilometres from the state's coast. However, some districts like Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur likely to get heavy rainfall on Friday, IMD scientist Umashankar Das said. Meanwhile, Odisha's Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) has put all the District Collectors on alert in the wake of the cyclone in the Bay of Bengal. ""We do not want to take any chance and therefore put the state machinery on alert for any eventuality,"" SRC Satyabrata Sahoo said. The cyclonic storm is likely to bring heavy rainfall in the coastal districts of West Bengal and in the northeastern states, the Met said. It is likely to bring isolated heavy downpour in West Bengal's coastal districts of Purba Medinipur, South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas on Friday, the weather office said. It said that the system is likely to bring very heavy rainfall in the northeastern states of Mizoram and Tripura on Friday and in Nagaland, Manipur, south Assam and east Meghalaya till Saturday. This is the second deep depression during this season. The previous cyclone Hamoon also headed towards the Bangladesh coast."

Princeton researchers and colleagues from around the world documented the effects using trail cameras and animal-tracking devices that had been in use before the storm.Thanks to the extensive network of cameras, GPS collars and other instruments, park staff and wildlife ecologists had an ""unprecedented opportunity"" to assemble a minute-by-minute view of how the storm affected the park and how the animals responded, said Hallie Brown, a postdoctoral research associate in Princeton's Department of Ecology and Environmental Biology and the first author of anew paperinNatureabout the hurricane's impact.""This is the first study that has ever been able to track the real-time responses of a large-mammal community to a natural disaster,"" said Robert Pringle, an EEB professor who has worked with Gorongosa National Park since its inception.Brown, now a postdoctoral research associate in Pringle's lab, was a graduate student at the time with Ryan Long, an associate professor of wildlife sciences at the University of Idaho and a former Princeton postdoc. Long and Pringle shared senior author credits on the new Nature paper.""We watched the waters rise,"" Brown recalled. ""We watched the animals' reactions in the hours, days and weeks after the cyclone: how some of them escaped the floodwaters, and some of them didn't. We used the data we had from before, during and after the storm to create, not just a description of this one event, but a broader set of expectations, so managers can better anticipate the effects of increasingly severe weather events.""The research team found that the best predictor of survival was size. The tiny oribi, about the size of a greyhound, saw its population plummet by 50%. About half of the slightly larger reedbucks died as well. The bushbucks, which are the smallest species that can wear a GPS collar, saw three of its eight collared animals die—the smallest male and the two smallest females—but only lost 4% of their population overall.GPS data revealed that the bushbucks looked for hills to climb, including termite mound hillocks that reach up to 16 feet tall (5 meters) and 65 feet long (20 meters), which became islands in the flood. The researchers saw that one survivor hopscotched from mound to mound, passing quickly through the floodwaters in between, before finding safety in the woods athigher elevations. The four largest herbivores wearing GPS collars—nyala, kudu, sable and elephant—had no fatalities.Mammals in the park range in size from the tiny oribi, which lost half of its population in the wake of Cyclone Idai, to the massive elephants that saw no fatalities from the storm or its aftermath. Credit: Hallie Brown, Princeton UniversityBody size also offered a secondary protection, the researchers found.""Not only could the smaller-sized animals not outpace the waters, they were also not able to buffer the nutritional limitation afterwards,"" said Brown. ""Because the flood was so high for so long, it killed a lot of the grasses and low-lying vegetation. Smaller animals can't withstand those nutritionally limited periods like larger animals, who have more fat to rely on.""The only previous study of hurricane effects on island populations looked at lizards and spiders in the Bahamas and found very similar patterns. ""It's incredible how the patterns we found cross taxonomic and geographic lines,"" said Brown. ""They seem to play out the same ways in our terrestrial ecosystem, with the largest mammals on earth, and with these tiny little invertebrates and reptiles in the Bahamas.""The researchers have two primary recommendations for other wildlife managers: evacuate the smallest and most ecologically vulnerable creatures to safer areas before storms come, and provide supplementary feed after the storm. Once all of the grasses have drowned, animals will turn to foraging on less-nutritious shrubs and bark, and many small creatures can't survive that dietary shift.The few carnivores in the park weathered the storm just fine, Brown said. Thewild dogsand leopards benefited from having their prey animals concentrated in the upland areas, and the lions' primary food source—warthogs—stayed in the uplands for several months but were otherwise largely unaffected by the cyclone.The research team included institutions from five countries: Princeton University; the University of Idaho-Moscow; the University of California-Merced; Montana State University-Bozeman; Yale University; Archbold Biological Station in Venus, Florida; the University of British Columbia-Vancouver; Gorongosa National Park; the University of Kent; the University of the Witwatersrand-Johannesburg; Associação Azul Moçambique in Maputo, Mozambique.Other Princeton authors on the paper are then-graduate students Matt Hutchinson, Ph.D. 2021; Justine Atkins Becker, Ph.D. 2020; Arjun Potter, Ph.D. 2022; and then-NSF postdoctoral fellow Meredith Palmer.""For me, the most exciting thing about this paper is the incredible collaboration between so many groups of researchers, from hydrology to large animal ecology, to create this really integrated piece of science,"" Brown said. ""The best work happens in collaborative projects."""

On the northern end of Acapulco Bay, hairdressers and masseuses sweep branches from a beach. Across the Pacific resort of Acapulco, residents work with a singular purpose: restart the tourism engine of this city of 1 million people as soon as possible. “If there’s no tourism, nothing happens,” said Juan Carlos Díaz, a 59-year-old laborer waiting for food distributed by soldiers. “It’s like a little chain, it generates (money) for everyone.” Otis, a Category 5 hurricane that smacked Acapulco on Oct. 25, damaged 80% of its hotels and 95% of its business, as well as leaving at least 48 people dead, 26 missing and impacting about 250,000 families, according to government data. Residents are striving to ensure the devastation is not a knockout blow to the once-legendary resort. Since Acapulco's golden era during the latter half of the 20th century – when Jackie and John F. Kennedy honeymooned here and Elvis Presley and other stars visited – the rise of other destinations like Cancun combined with organized crime to drive away international visitors. But the city still had a devoted following of Mexican tourists who came for its beaches and nightlife. It had been hosting sporting events and major business gatherings, including an international mining conference that was in town when Otis hit. The resort boasted 20,000 hotel rooms, 377 hotels and a bevy of other vacation accommodations. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised that Acapulco will be ready to receive visitors this holiday season, if in reduced numbers , but not everyone believes it. Most think it will take the city a year or two to come back from Otis’ devastation. Yair Guevara, head waiter at the Dreams hotel, one of the tall towers hollowed out by Otis’ 165 mph winds, showed up for work the day after the storm and began coordinating cleaning shifts for 20 workers. During those early days they were paid in food and basic necessities, he said. On a recent morning, about 30 members of a collective of masseuses and hairdressers unearthed pieces of wrecked boats as they cleaned a beach on northern Acapulco Bay. “We want the tourists to come soon,” Linda Vidal said, explaining why they were sweeping the beach. The famous La Quebrada cliff divers who have left tourists breathless for decades have been cleaning the ocean floor of debris in the area where they end their more than 100-foot swan dives into the Pacific. “There was a lot of debris, glass and metal,” said Eligio Álvarez, who at 50 years old still launches himself into the roiling water. He and others are rushing to set up virtual shows like they did during the pandemic to earn money until the tourists can return. Getting steady internet restored is their current obstacle. Jesús Zamora, a member of the state tourism council in Guerrero, where Acapulco is located, rebuilt part of his restaurant with fallen limbs and in four days had a section of it reopened. Last weekend, he hosted dozens of diners, among them officials who were taking a census of the damage to the tourism sector. Zamora and others still don’t know how much aid that census will bring them or when it will come. “We’re just hoping” that it comes, he said. López Obrador has met multiple times with business leaders from Acapulco’s tourism sector. While they’ve kept their comments discreet, they believe the support offered so far – loans and tax extensions – are positive but insufficient. The president has prioritized direct aid to the poorest families, though much of that assistance too has not yet materialized. At the Flamingos Hotel – once host to Hollywood legends John Wayne, Errol Flynn and Cary Grant – a handful of the owners’ friends recently were picking up branches and debris around the place where the most famous Tarzan, Johnny Weissmuller, spent the last years of his life. The lush trees, including a century-old ceiba, are stripped of their branches. Diana Santiago, the owner’s daughter, thinks rebuilding the pink hotel’s spartan 40 rooms will be slow because they don’t yet know where the money will come from. “We are going to open an account (for donations) to survive these months,” Santiago said. They also plan to fall back on a survival strategy from the pandemic: selling take-out food until they can reopen the restaurant with its spectacular views. The hotel rooms will come last. The big hotel chains also doubt they will be able to open as soon as López Obrador would like even though they swarm with workers, many who have arrived from out of state. And even though the president has assured people that the Mexican Open tennis tournament – Acapulco’s most emblematic sporting event -- will continue its uninterrupted run since 2001 in February with champions like Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, the organizers have yet to confirm that. The Princess hotel, the enormous glass and balconied pyramid where the tennis players stay, has not said when it will reopen. Otis left it in skeletal form. The government declared an end to the emergency in Acapulco last week, but many in the city still lack the basic necessities and mountains of garbage and debris continue to clog streets. Gregorio García, a cab driver who was back to work after the storm as soon as he could patch a tire and find gasoline, conceded there are residents who complain that the tourism sector is prioritized in recovery efforts. He still doesn’t have electricity or water at home, but he doesn’t agree with the complaints. “If there aren’t tourists there’s nothing,” he said. __ AP writers Mark Stevenson and Carlos Rodríguez in Mexico City contributed to this report."

<ul><li>Urban waterfronts are neglected in many Am… [+9029 chars]",News,"On a sunny, 80-degree Saturday afternoon in late October, Mia Olis left her home in Chelsea to soak up the rays on Manhattan's brand-new — and so far only — public beach. Raised in Hawaii, Olis loves the water and surfing. But Rockaway Beach — more than an hour away by subway — was too far a trek that day. The 1,200 tons of sand near Greenwich Village along the Hudson river would have to do. ""I love that everybody's here,"" Olis, a 40-year-old lawyer, said while perched on a towel in a bikini. But she noted the park sits in a ritzy neighborhood, and thought it felt a little exclusive. ""I wish it were more accessible to everybody else from uptown, Harlem, the Bronx."" Still, she said, any new green space in New York is cause for celebration. Urban waterways can be a huge asset to cities and their residents. Rivers, lakes, canals, and ocean beaches can attract new residents, visitors, and commercial development. If they're well-designed, they can make cities more inclusive and help protect them from storms and heatwaves. Waterfronts are also just nice places to be. People are naturally drawn to them, as manya poetand sociologist has pointed out. And they'll alsopay a premium to live by them. Economists say cities with struggling downtowns should invest in their green space — and that includes opening up waterfronts. ""Places that have better natural amenities — they tend to do better. They attract more people, they attract more jobs, they have higher economic growth,"" said Amanda Weinstein, a professor of economics at the University of Akron. But they have to be made accessible. ""It's the investment in that natural amenity that matters."" While the breeze off the Hudson offered some respite on that unusually warm fall day, a dip in the water would've been an even better way to cool off. But there's no public pool nearby, andno sanctioned river swim spotsin the city. Even if the Hudsonwas consistently clean enough to swim in, it would take a lot to convince many New Yorkers to dive in. ""It would be a really big leap for me to swim in it,"" said Karin Balow, a 58-year-old Inwood resident who grew up along the river upstate. She traveled from her Upper Manhattan home to check out the new beach, where she settled into an Adirondack chair with a book. ""But it has come a long, long way. So who knows?"" New York City has done a lot to invest in its 520 miles of waterfront. The sandy bluff on Gansevoort peninsula is part of the much larger Hudson River park and looks out over Little Island,a whimsical, highly instagrammable transformationof Pier 55. Hoards of people crowded the winding, tree-lined paths up to the island's breezy observation deck on that October day. If they read the signage, they'd know the city's garbage used to be incinerated where they stood. The park — the borough's second-largest — is credited withhelping revitalize Manhattan's west side. Over the last couple of decades, New York has built a series of iconic waterfront parks on former industrial sites like Brooklyn Bridge Park and Domino Park in Brooklyn, Battery Park and the East River park in Manhattan, and Gantry State Plaza Park and Astoria Park in Queens. Governor's island now features manmade hills with sweeping skyline views, urban farming, and glamping. And the East River might soon geta massive floating pool. Cities across the country are increasingly looking to transform their neglected waterfronts in an effort to bring people back downtown. Cleveland, Ohio, isworking on a planfor a new beach, housing, and park space on the shores of Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River. Seattle has torn down an elevated freeway downtown to make way for a waterfront park. A couple hundred miles south of Manhattan, the waters off the shores of the nation's capital are also finding new life. In recent years, DC has opened up its waterfront,transforming the southwestwith the glitzy Wharf — featuring luxury condos, restaurants, music venues, and a soccer stadium, and redeveloping the Capitol riverfrontfrom Navy Yardto Buzzard Point with the Nationals baseball stadium and tons of new housing. The city just recently finished its decade-long construction of two major tunnels that capture stormwater, preventingalmost all sewage from overflowinginto the Anacostia river during storms and easing flooding in low-lying neighborhoods. For the first time in over a half century, the city is planning to open the Anacostia river next June for a sanctioned swimming event. The splash event was supposed to happen in July, and then September of this year, but was postponed twice due to severe storms. Urban waterways like the Hudson and Anacostia pose aserious flooding threatto cities as climate change triggers rising sea levels and more ferocious storms. Waterfront parks can helpin collecting storm surge and rainwater and preventing flooding. They can also offer respite as summers get hotter. Cities — built of heat-absorbing asphalt and concrete, instead of cooling greenery —make heatwaves even worse. International climate experts warn heat-related deaths globallycould more than quadrupleby mid-century if the planet heats up to 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels. A cool breeze off a river or lake, or a dip in one, could save lives. ""There is a very real need in cities,"" said Trey Sherard, the riverkeeper at the DC non-profit Anacostia Riverkeeper, which is organizing the June swim event. ""It's not just recreation, it's public health to be able to cool off that way."" Climate resilience is also key to building more equitable cities. Communities of color and lower-income neighborhoods across the countryare disproportionately impactedby environmental impacts, like flooding and extreme heat.In the DC area, the vast majority of homes most vulnerable to floodingare in Ward 7 and Prince George's County, Maryland, both of which are majority Black. VIDEO: Thousands of people take to the beaches of Rio de Janeiro to cool off as a heatwave strikes parts of Brazil in the middle of spring. According to the Alerta Rio system, the maximum temperature recorded on Sunday was 42.5 degrees Celsius in Iraja.pic.twitter.com/vVJ9elwcss There are also historic inequities when it comes to swimming. Public pools across the country were largely racially segregated until the 1950s — and after that, manyprivate poolsopened to cater to white people fleeing desegregation. Without safe and clean rivers and lakes to turn to, Black communities across the country often didn't have anywhere to take a dip or teach their kids to swim. DC's Black communities still face many of these challenges. The free swimming lessons that the city department of parks and recreation offers can't meet the high demand and don't cater to adults. ""There's a lot of water fear in DC, especially east of the river. And that speaks to generations being separated from their waterways,"" Sherard said. Sherard said the Anacostia's inaugural swim event is being modeled after one on the Charles River in Boston. But he also pointed to international models. In Switzerland's biggest city, Zurich, swimmers can hop into the Limmat river or Lake Zurich right downtown. The most enthusiastic locals in Zurich and Bernswim to and from workwith their phone, wallet, and clothes strapped to them ina floating waterproof satchel. Paris is poised toopen up its Seine River to swimmersfor the first time in 100 years. Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who's something ofa global urbanist hero, has pioneered a billion-dollar effort to clean up the iconic river in time to hold Olympic events in it next summer. Skepticism abounds about how clean the murky depths of the Anacostia are. Sherard said he hears plenty of ""hell no, never"" when it comes to swimming in the river, but he's also found real enthusiasm for opening the river up. There's lots of work left to do. Advocates for the river want Congress to approve funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the Anacostia to remove toxic sediment and ease flooding. If the river is dredged, it could also be a huge boost for the country's first African American boating club —Seafarers Yacht Club— whose boathouse on the river's west bank is only accessible in high tide because of accumulated sediment. ""What a gem to have on the river,"" Sherard said."

Tignes and Val Thorens, which have many runs above 2,000 metres, were the first downhill resorts to open. Cross country trails opened in Bessans on November 4 while Les Saisies did the same Saturday, but just for a short loop using snow stored since last winter. ""It is the moment to have fun,"" said Vincent Lecluyse as he shimmied down a run at Val Thorens. He had come with two friends from the South of France because ""there's not yet much of a crowd and the chalets are cheaper"" than in high season. Other resorts will have to wait. Mild temperatures and heavy rains hit the Northern Alps earlier this week, washing out much of the snow that had fallen in previous weeks. ""It was important to reassure our clients and tell them that we have snow and that they can come,"" said Jerome Grellet, director of Val Thorens. After the recent storms, ""there is no more snow below 1,500 and 1,700 metres altitude and there has been a decline between 1,500 and 2,500 metres,"" said Gilles Brunot, director of the Chamonix office of Meteo France, the national weather service. ""At 2,500 metres there's still quite a bit of snow,"" he said, ""though it is less and less rare to see rain at that elevation even in high season."" Most resorts expect to open in December or for the Christmas holidays, which appear to be well booked. According to the Association of Mayors of Mountain Resorts (ANMSM), the occupation rate for the first part of the season is already 52 percent, compared with 51 percent at the same time last year. In recent years, the lack of snow and temperatures too warm for artificial snow have led resorts to offer other activities to keep their visitors busy. Seasonal workers continue to be in short supply, even if less so than in previous years. ""We raised salaries in response to inflation,"" said Vincenzo Coppola, director of the tourism office in Montgenevre, a ski report on the Italian border. ""But it is true that high rents and a lack of lodging are serious constraints."" Antoine Fatiga, head of the CGT union for ski lift workers, agreed salaries have improved. But he said ski resorts are also increasingly bringing in African and Asian workers. Inflation is likewise a concern for clients. According to the price comparison site Ski Express, skiers should expect their ski break to cost 9.5 percent more this year than last."

Heavy rains also were reported in Haiti, where the Civil Protection Agency told The Associated Press late Friday that two people had died after being swept away by floods in the country's western Grand'Anse region. The disturbance was about 85 miles (135 kilometers) northeast of Montego Bay, Jamaica, with top winds of 35 mph (55 mph) Friday night. It was moving northeast at 17 mph (28 kph), according to the US National Hurricane Center in Miami. Forecasters had said earlier in the day that the disturbance could become a tropical cyclone, but late Friday they said that was now considered unlikely, though they warned its rains remained a danger. Some 14,000 customers lost power in Jamaica after heavy rains downed trees, severed power lines and caused landslides, according to the Jamaica Public Service Company. At least 24 people were rescued from floodwaters in the island's southeastern region, according to the Jamaican Defense Force. A tropical storm watch remained in effect for Haiti, but watches were discontinued for eastern Cuba, the southeastern Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The disturbance was expected to move across southeast Cuba during the night and the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands on Saturday. Up to 16 inches (40 centimeters) of rain were expected for parts of Jamaica, southeast Cuba, southern Haiti and the Dominican Republic through Sunday, with forecasters warning of mudslides and flash flooding."

By RFA Burmese 2023.11.17 -- Clashes this week in western Myanmar between the Arakan Army and junta troops have driven more than 26,000 people from their homes, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said on Friday. After the ethnic armed forces seized a police station in Rakhine state Thursday morning, junta forces retaliated with airstrikes. The military regime also brought in navy ships, one Pauktaw township resident told Radio Free Asia. Gunfire continued until Thursday afternoon, when locals began to leave en masse. ""I am not sure whether all the residents could get out of the city,"" he said, asking to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. ""I think parts of the city are blocked as [junta troops] are shooting from both air and sea."" The escalated hostilities in Rakhine and neighboring southern Chin state have restricted key transport routes and waterways between Rakhine's state capital of Sittwe and Yangon, Myanmar's commercial capital, according to Friday's update from OCHA. Fighting has been especially intense in Rakhine's Pauktaw and Maungdaw townships and in Chin's Paletwa township, according to OCHA. Since Monday, 11 deaths and more than 30 injuries have been reported, and more than 100 people have reportedly been detained by junta forces, OCHA said. Humanitarian aid suspended The attack on the police station ended a ceasefire brokered in 2022 after fighting led to shortages in food, medicine and access to health care for more than 2 million residents. In May, Cyclone Mocha devastated much of Rakhine. Hungry and shelterless residents have complained for months of slow or nonexistent aid delivery in the aftermath of the storm. OCHA said Friday that most humanitarian activities have been suspended ""due to the resurgence of conflict, increased security scrutiny, road and waterway blockades, and movement restrictions between urban and rural areas."" Tensions between the junta and the Arakan Army had resurfaced in recent months, according to Richard Horsey, the International Crisis Group's senior Myanmar adviser. ""Both sides knew that fighting could resume at any time,"" he said on Friday. ""The regime kept sizable forces deployed in the state for that eventuality."" On Thursday, two junta warships traveling along the Kaladan River fired more than 10 shots with heavy weapons. The ships continued to Pauktaw along the Kwe Ku River as a helicopter from Sittwe continued firing. ""Two of three navy ships docked and one remained on the river. Now the helicopter is hovering and shooting,"" the Pauktaw resident said. ""Residents from the city are fleeing to nearby places."" A new hotspot The Pauktaw police station, previously under junta control, was seized by the Arakan Army, said another Pauktaw resident, but the city continued to be attacked by the junta airforce and navy. ""The residents from the city are fleeing and [junta soldiers] are shooting. I know there is damage and that there have been casualties, but we are still hiding,"" he told RFA, asking to remain anonymous. Pauktaw's residents escaped on foot, by cars and on motorcycles, according to a video uploaded to Facebook on Thursday afternoon. The Arakan Army ""has seized the moment to press its advantage"" following the Operation 1027 offensive that began three weeks ago, Horsey said. The Arakan Army is part of the ""Three Brotherhood"" Alliance of rebels that has seen notable gains against the military in several key cities in Shan state in the country's northeast. This week's attacks by the Arakan Army in western Myanmar have created a new hotspot that ""the regime can ill afford to get bogged down in,"" according to Horsey. ""It also will not welcome the idea of renewed conflict with the AA, which it has struggled to overcome even when other parts of Myanmar were quiet, back in 2019-2020,"" he said. The junta has yet to release any information on the incidents in Pauktaw. RFA called Rakhine state's junta spokesperson Hla Thein, but he did not answer the phone. Translated by RFA Burmese.

We will move to the next level, which is the Supreme Court. That Alkali and some others left the party doesn’t mean others will do same. It has also nothing to even do with this judgment.“The people we are more concerned about are at the grassroots. These are the people who voted and having their mandate being taken away from them at the moment. Those are the people we are worried about. Not some political jobbers jumping from one party to the others,” he said.In a related development, the Director-General of Labour Party Campaign Organisation, Akin Osuntokun, also said defection can’t be ruled out in politics.He said, “In politics, you can’t rule that out. It is possible. But I doubt it will happen in LP for the simple reason that a Labour Party governor or a senator already has a big profile where they are currently. If they decide to join the APC, they are just going to be a back bencher there.“Even if you want to look at it from that point of view, I don’t see what they stand to gain by joining the APC. This is because the ruling party has come to personify everything that is wrong with Nigeria. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t see the pressure, either from the point of real politik or logic.“As I said, I am just hearing about it (fear of defection among members) for the first time. But given the tradition of contemporary politics in the Fourth Republic, I can’t rule it out. It is the kind of thing that can happen. Don’t forget that Wike, who is the current Minister of the FCT is still in the PDP. What we learnt about them is they are making efforts to rebuild the PDP and not to decamp to the APC.”Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Ibrahim Abdullahi, also shared Osuntokun’s sentiment when he said only members who lack ideology and political merit can take such plunge.Abdullahi further stressed the PDP is different, adding that even as fiery as the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike, has proven to be, he is still not interested in dumping the party despite taking a political appointment from the president.“As a Nigerian, however, I will be concerned if the wave of carpet crossing is encouraged in that manner. It is a bad development and a negative narrative to African politics and to the Nigeria’s own in particular. We as a party has not thought about, seen or heard any of our ardent members threatening to leave for the APC. Even Wike himself that has gone to accept an appointment, has not declared that he is with the APC. Less than 48 hours ago, he still said that he is with the PDP.“So it goes without saying some people cannot withstand the hurricane. People who are extremely hungry, devoid of ideology and lack merit over the years have just seen the reason for them to say ‘Let us just go and have a share of the cake, no matter how little.’ But what they must know is that if you are joining these people because you have become triumphant, you are not likely to benefit anything. And they will be looking at you like a hungry, miserable fellow who came to feast with them,” he stated.

[+] Images) As the leaves turn and the air grows crisp, Thanksgiving ushers in a season of gratitude, family, and, of course, fantastic movies that celebrate the holiday. Whether you're in the mood for a heartwarming family drama, a side-splitting comedy, or a film that offers a unique take on this special time of year, my list of the top 10 must-watch Thanksgiving movies has something for everyone. Each film, with its unique charm and storyline, captures the essence of Thanksgiving, making them perfect for holiday viewing. I’ve provided a short plot description for each movie and why its perfect for your movie lineup this week. So, grab some pumpkin pie, cozy up on the couch, and get ready to dive into these cinematic treasures that are sure to become part of your Thanksgiving traditions. Planes, Trains and Automobiles Directed by John Hughes, this 1987 comedy classic is a quintessential Thanksgiving film. Starring Steve Martin and John Candy, it encapsulates the frantic, often humorous struggle many endure to get home for the holiday. The film's heart lies in the unlikely friendship that develops between Martin's uptight marketing executive and Candy's affable, but clumsy shower curtain ring salesman. Their misadventures, filled with laugh-out-loud moments and touching camaraderie, mirror the chaos and warmth of Thanksgiving, making Planes, Trains and Automobiles a perfect reflection of the holiday's spirit of gratitude and family, no matter how one defines it. Hannah and Her Sisters Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters, a rich tapestry of intertwined lives and loves, unfolds around three consecutive Thanksgiving gatherings. The 1986 film, starring Mia Farrow, Michael Caine, and Diane Wiest, is set against the backdrop of New York's autumnal charm. It skillfully weaves themes of romance, existential angst, and familial bonds, mirroring the complexity of Thanksgiving itself—a time for reflection, gratitude, and sometimes, unspoken tensions. The holiday meals serve as pivotal moments, bringing characters together in scenarios that are at once relatable and poignantly unique. This film offers a sophisticated, comedic, and heartfelt look at relationships, making it a poignant choice for the season. Avalon Step into the world of Avalon, Barry Levinson's charming portrayal of a 1950s Jewish family in Baltimore. It's Thanksgiving, and everything is set for a perfect family dinner, but wait – they start without Uncle Gabriel! This tiny mishap sets off a chain of events, highlighting the quirky, sometimes messy dynamics that make this family so relatable. With Armin Mueller-Stahl leading a stellar cast, the film wraps you in nostalgia, making you laugh and sigh as it explores the bittersweet changes time brings to families and traditions. It's a Thanksgiving movie with heart, humor, and a dash of yesteryear charm. The Ice Storm Imagine a Thanksgiving where instead of turkey and stuffing, you get secrets and lies. Welcome to The Ice Storm. Directed by Ang Lee and starring Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver, this film dives into the chilly emotional landscape of a 1970s suburban family. As the storm brews outside, so does the drama inside, with every glance and whisper adding to the tension. This isn't your typical feel-good holiday movie, but its compelling storytelling and top-notch acting make it a fascinating watch for those who like their Thanksgiving with a side of intrigue and introspection. She's Gotta Have It Get ready for a Thanksgiving dinner like no other in Spike Lee's vibrant She's Gotta Have It. The Brooklyn scene is set, and Nola Darling is hosting not one, not two, but three suitors at her table. Talk about a recipe for disaster—or is it a delightful disaster? This film is a feast of wit, style, and some seriously snappy dialogue. It's a refreshing take on relationships, identity, and of course, Thanksgiving dinner drama. With its sharp humor and unique characters, this indie gem adds a dash of spice to the traditional Thanksgiving movie lineup. Krisha Hold on to your turkey legs for Krisha, a Thanksgiving drama that's as intense as your grandma's secret gravy recipe. Directed by Trey Edward Shults, this indie powerhouse revolves around Krisha, the black sheep of the family, returning for Thanksgiving dinner. But this isn't just any dinner—it's a simmering pot of family tensions, past regrets, and raw emotions. The movie's gripping narrative and realistic portrayal of a family at breaking point make it a standout choice. Watch Krisha for a Thanksgiving story that's as real as it gets, served with a side of superb acting and gripping drama. Home for the Holidays Dive into the chaotic yet endearing world of Home for the Holidays. Directed by Jodie Foster, this movie stars Holly Hunter as a single mom who joins the Thanksgiving family reunion, only to find herself in the middle of classic family quirks and squabbles. Think of it as your family's Thanksgiving dinner, but with more laughs and less stress on your part. With charming performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Anne Bancroft, this film is a warm reminder of why we brave the holiday craziness: for love, laughter, and the chance to connect, even amidst the chaos. Rocky Not your typical Thanksgiving flick, but Rocky packs a punch for the holiday. In this iconic film by John G. Avildsen, Sylvester Stallone isn't just fighting in the ring; he's also navigating a Thanksgiving scene that sets the stage for his character's journey. It’s a Thanksgiving dinner with a twist, where turkey gets thrown out the window, literally. This moment in the movie may be brief, but it’s as memorable as the film itself. Rocky reminds us that Thanksgiving can be about starting new journeys and chasing dreams, all with a side of determination and grit. Pieces of April Prepare for a quirky, heartwarming Thanksgiving journey with Pieces of April. Katie Holmes stars as April, a young woman attempting to host her estranged family for Thanksgiving in her tiny New York apartment. Chaos and comedy ensue, from a broken oven to eccentric neighbors. This film, directed by Peter Hedges, beautifully captures the essence of Thanksgiving: making the best out of messy situations and the importance of family bonds, even when they're frayed. It's a delightful, offbeat gem that serves up laughter, tears, and a generous helping of Thanksgiving spirit. Soul Food Gather around for Soul Food, a movie that's as comforting and satisfying as the meal it's named after. Directed by George Tillman Jr., this film is a heartwarming portrayal of a family's love and struggles, centered around their Sunday dinners. While Thanksgiving is never prominently featured in the film, the essence of the holiday comes to life in scenes filled with laughter, drama, and, of course, mouth-watering food. Starring Vanessa Williams, Vivica A. Fox, and Nia Long, Soul Food explores the deep connections and enduring bonds of family. It's a film that celebrates the joys and challenges of family life, making it a perfect pick for Thanksgiving viewing."

Most of the island has already been lost to the sea, and what remains is routinely flooded at high tide.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Children wade through floodwater on Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone. Most of the island has already been lost to the sea, and what remains is routinely flooded at high tide. When 62-year-old fisherman Kpana Charlie has finished sorting through the day's catch and patching up the holes in his nets, he likes to settle into a weathered wooden chair on his front porch and let his mind drift back to his childhood. Back then, his home on Sierra Leone's Nyangai Island seemed like paradise. He spent endless hours playing with his friends on the island's dazzling white beaches or splashing about in the warm, green sea. He liked to kick around a soccer ball on the sports field in his village, and in mango season, he would shimmy up the trees to collect their bountiful fruit. Whenever he wanted to avoid having to do his homework, he could simply disappear into the dense forest that covered much of the island. Today, Nyangai is disappearing before his very eyes, swallowed up by the relentless sea. As recently as ten years ago, it still measured some 2,300 feet from end to end. What's left today is a patch of sand barely 300 feet long and 250 wide. The forests are gone, swamped by saltwater. The soccer field lies under water for 22 hours of the day. And the land on which Charlie's family home once stood, the home he was born in, has long since vanished beneath the waves. In as little as two years, Charlie fears, Nyangai may no longer exist at all. ""It's getting worse and worse,"" says Charlie, a father of six who has lived in a makeshift home of sticks and tarpaulin since his previous home was washed away. ""There's nowhere to go to the toilet. There's nowhere to be free. Whenever the water's high the place floods all over. It never used to happen like this."" ""It's getting worse and worse,"" says islander Kpana Charlie, a father of six who has lived in a makeshift home of sticks and tarpaulin since his previous home was washed away. ""Whenever the water's high the place floods all over. It never used to happen like this.""Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption ""It's getting worse and worse,"" says islander Kpana Charlie, a father of six who has lived in a makeshift home of sticks and tarpaulin since his previous home was washed away. It never used to happen like this."" With nearly a third of its population living in coastal areas, and its heavy reliance on subsistence agriculture and fishing, Sierra Leone has been identifiedas one of the world'smost vulnerable countriesto the impacts of climate change, despite having contributed just a tiny fraction of global CO2 emissions. With a GDP per capita of barely $2,000, it is also one of the least prepared to deal with those impacts. With global sea levels projected to rise by anywhere between 1 and 3 feet by the end of the century, along with an increase in extreme weather events, the experience of this West African island offers a glimpse into the possible fate of countless other low-lying areas around the world. From his office in the capital, Freetown, Gabriel Kpaka, the head of operations for the country's Meteorological Agency, says the reason for Nyangai's troubles is clear. Kpana Charlie, 62, looks on as seawater floods onto Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone. In the span of his lifetime, Charlie has watched the island shrink to just a tiny fraction of its former size as it is swallowed up by the encroaching sea. He believes in as little as two years it may vanish beneath the waves altogether.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Kpana Charlie, 62, looks on as seawater floods onto Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone. He believes in as little as two years it may vanish beneath the waves altogether. ""We're seeing significant sea-level rise and these people don't have any proper defenses,"" he says. ""All they have is sandbags. If we don't act now the impacts on people are just going to get worse."" Nyangai is one of a cluster of islands that make up the Turtle Islands archipelago. Low-lying and with loose, sandy soils, the islands have always been shaped by the sea. Their beaches shift slowly over time. Sand is eroded from one headland and deposited on the next. But the scale of the destruction of Nyangai, and the speed at which it's playing out, is like nothing the islanders have ever seen. Loading... The island's chief, Mustafa Kong, estimates that 20 years ago there were more than 500 homes on Nyangai, with an average of 8 people living in each. Now there are barely 70. Most people have left for the safety of neighboring islands or the mainland, joining theestimated 20 million peopleworldwide displaced by climate change and extreme weather events on average each year. There is little reliable data on sea level change in Sierra Leone. Until two years ago, the country did not even have a fully functional marine meteorological station that could measure it. But, a 2017 USAID climate vulnerability study found that parts of its coastline are already receding at a rate of 13-to-20 feet per year. From their vantage point on Nyangai, most of the islanders say it's hard to gauge how much the sea level itself is rising. What's more apparent, they say, is that the storms have become more severe and more frequent, the rainfall more violent and less predictable, and the winds stronger, driving ever more destructive waves that batter and erode their shrinking island.

The island is rapidly being washed away by the encroaching sea. When Charlies was growing up, the thought had never even crossed his mind that the island on which his family had lived for three generations could be at serious risk from the sea. But, by 2012, he'd started to become worried. He remembers vividly the first time he truly began to believe the island might become uninhabitable. It was a Friday night in August 2012, and the islanders woke up to the sound of a howling gale and waves crashing into the walls of their homes. By midnight, panic had taken over, as families rushed to save their possessions and store them in the comparative safety of their boats. By the time the storm eventually abated, 35 houses had been washed away. ""It was chaos,"" says Charlie. ""Everyone was so afraid. The next morning, we all decided to leave. I told myself I couldn't stay here any longer."" Many left the island soon after, but as calm gradually returned, Charlie changed his mind. He no longer felt safe on the island, but the prospect of setting up a new life elsewhere was no less daunting. Nyangai was his home. He liked that the island was free of snakes and, with no fresh water for mosquitoes to breed, virtually free of malaria. His family owned land there, and the surrounding waters provided his livelihood. Besides, moving would be hugely expensive. ""Now we're always prepared because we know we'll have to move,"" says Charlie. ""We just don't know when."" On a Friday in late September, Charlie stands by the shore in the shade of one of the few trees still standing, watching as the high tide breached the top of the beach and began flowing down through people's homes on the other side. The islanders scramble to make what rudimentary defenses they can. One woman builds a ridge of sand around the base of her house to try to channel the water elsewhere. Another grabs a tattered sheet of tarpaulin and wedges it beneath her front door. Most of Nyangai's population has already left, and those who have stayed know that their days on the island may be numbered.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Most of Nyangai's population has already left, and those who have stayed know that their days on the island may be numbered. By 8 a.m., at least a dozen houses have been flooded, yet again, and a knee-deep pool of muddy water has accumulated in the center of the island. Children run out to play in it. ""The kids love it when it floods,"" complains one bystander. ""They don't understand that that's what will destroy the island. The water is destroying us, one house at a time."" As the tide continues to rise, shopkeeper Tene Kamara races to pack up her inventory — soap, toothpaste, sandals and other basic goods imported from the mainland — and store them on tabletops above the reach of the water. Kamara spent 15 years building up her business on Nyangai after moving to the island from Freetown.

""I'm afraid, and it makes my heart worry.""Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Shopkeeper Tene Kamara, 48, photographed in her shop on Nyangai island, Sierra Leone. ""I'm afraid, and it makes my heart worry."" Some of the other islands of the Turtle Islands archipelago are also experiencing increasing rates of erosion but not on the scale seen on Nyangai. Some are ringed by protective mangrove forests whose tangle of roots and branches act as a barrier to the waves and help to trap sediment. Others rise higher above sea level or have denser, less sandy soil. All are now home to growing numbers of people displaced from Nyangai. ""I loved Nyangai so much,"" says Karim Anso, a 43-year-old former resident of the island who last year made the move to nearby Sei Island. ""The fishing was good. We had good friends. But the water became a problem. The sea took everything."" Karim Anso, a 43-year-old refugee from Nyangai Island, photogaphed outside his new home on nearby Sei Island. Anso's family had to rebuild their home four times, fleeing ever further inland as the sea encroached onto Nyangai Island. Eventually, with the island continuing to shrink, he relocated at significant cost.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Karim Anso, a 43-year-old refugee from Nyangai Island, photogaphed outside his new home on nearby Sei Island. Eventually, with the island continuing to shrink, he relocated at significant cost. Each time the water destroyed his house, Anso says, he would build another one farther inland. By the time his fourth home had been washed away, he decided he had no option but to leave with his wife and four children. ""I did it for my children,"" he said, sitting in a hammock outside his new home on Sei. For the roughly 400 people who remain, the constant erosion has prevented any kind of stability. At one point there were three separate villages on different parts of the island. By 2012, however, the land had been reduced to a thin strip, and the villages merged into a single settlement stretching along its length. Then, in 2015, the sea began to eat away the strip's middle, eventually separating the people on one end from those on the other. One island had become two. At low tide, children from one side would have to wade through water to get to school on the other. At high tide they'd have to take a boat. Friends and families were divided. Kpana Charlie was appointed as a new chief to run Mokontan, the name given to one of the two outposts, while Chief Kong ran the other one, known as Mobiaboi. Storm clouds gather over the site where Mobiaboi Town once stood before it was lost to the sea in 2022, in Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone. All that remains of that settlement is a sand bar that emerges at low tide, dotted with the stumps of coconut palms that were once part of a dense forest. As little as five years ago, the settlement was home to hundreds of people.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Storm clouds gather over the site where Mobiaboi Town once stood before it was lost to the sea in 2022, in Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone. As little as five years ago, the settlement was home to hundreds of people. But no sooner had the islanders grown accustomed to this new state of affairs than Mobiaboi was overtaken by the waves. As recently as 2018 it had been a bustling village of more than a hundred homes, but by the end of 2022, the last family had packed up and left. Today all that remains of the place are the stumps of dead coconut palms embedded in a forlorn mound of sand that emerges at low tide. Nyangai is one island again, and the whole population is now crammed into what's left of Mokontan, with Mustafa Kong back in charge. Kong has an unenviable role. He is responsible for the well-being of his people but is utterly powerless to arrest the advance of the water. At one stage he organized the planting of a small mangrove forest in an attempt to shore up one side of the island, but the seedlings didn't last long. Goats devoured most of them. Storms uprooted the rest. Kong has appealed to the government to build a levee around the island, but this has not happened. Mustafa Kong salvages building materials from the wreckage of his house, destroyed by flooding two weeks earlier, on Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone. ""God will decide what happens to us"" said Kong, who has seen the vast majority of his island disappear into the ocean in the span of his lifetime.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Mustafa Kong salvages building materials from the wreckage of his house, destroyed by flooding two weeks earlier, on Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone.

""There's nothing else I can do for them,"" he said, sitting on a chair in front of a friend's home, where he's been living since his own house was destroyed by flooding two weeks earlier. ""We used to have so much. Now everything's gone."" In the nearest large town, the former British trading post of Bonthe, where colonial ruins still dot the coast, the local government has responded to the sharp increase in flooding by constructing a concrete seawall along the length of the town. But in the many smaller coastal towns and villages in the area, there simply aren't the resources. A USAID initiative attempted to help protect some of the area's most vulnerable settlements by planting mangroves, but this has had limited success. With insufficient funds for their upkeep, and with the population relying on mangrove wood for building and smoking fish, few trees outlived the project, which concluded in 2021. When theenvironmental news outlet Mongabayvisited one of the project sites in 2022, it found that, out of 1,000 mangrove trees planted, barely 60 were still alive. The national government, meanwhile, struggles to maintain key infrastructure and provide basic services even in the capital, let alone undertake costly engineering projects on a remote island now home to just a few hundred people. ""Nyangai is not a government priority at the moment,"" acknowledges Paul Lamin, the deputy director of the country's Environmental Protection Agency.""We have so many competing priorities in Sierra Leone and only scarce resources."" Lamin says the government has been implementing mangrove restoration projects in some communities, as well as raising awareness of the risks of deforestation, but that no other sea defenses are currently planned. ""Vulnerable countries should be getting some support [from wealthy nations] to strengthen their climate resilience,"" says Lamin. ""But we're not really seeing that.""

On Nyangai, Chief Kong's long-held dream had been to build himself a home of bricks or concrete, a home fit for a chief that would be a source of pride and prestige not only for him, personally, but for the island as a whole. But over the years, the dream has died. The typical Turtle Islands home has walls of intricately woven sticks overlaid with palm fronds or a mud coating, with a roof of dense thatch. But for his last two homes, Kong has simply used fabric from old sacks stretched over a frame of sticks, using rusting sheets of corrugated iron for a roof. Doing any more, he feels, would be a waste of time. Most of Nyangai's houses are now built in a similar fashion, giving the place the transitory feel of a refugee camp. ""My heart is broken,"" said Kong, who rarely leaves his house these days. ""I just sit inside, thinking about it. It makes me so sad."" For those who remain on Nyangai, life is becoming increasingly tough. The island's well has been flooded with sea-water, forcing islanders to travel 45 minutes each way by boat to collect drinking water from neighboring islands during the long months of the dry season. There's no longer anywhere private for them to relieve themselves, so the islanders simply hide behind bushes on the shore, timing their toilet trips so that the beach can be washed clean by the incoming tide. Without space to play soccer or forests to play in, children mill around looking bored or devise games among the stumps of the uprooted trees that ring much of the island. No one is certain what will happen next. Charlie's predicted two-year timeline for the island's future may be on the short side. Others hope that at least a part of it will hold out for several more years or perhaps even longer. Dead and dying trees, the remnants of what were once extensive forests, dot the fast receding shoreline of Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone.Tommy Trenchard for NPRhide caption Dead and dying trees, the remnants of what were once extensive forests, dot the fast receding shoreline of Nyangai Island, Sierra Leone. But the island's long-term prospects look bleak. Among the islanders still there, a sense of fatalism now prevails. They know they lack the means to stop the continuing destruction of their island. They also know there is scant prospect of receiving much help from outside. Instead, many say they have put their faith in a higher power. ""The sea is eating our island,"" said Chief Kong with resignation. ""God will decide what happens to us. We're in his hands now.""

Besides marquee events like the World Cup and Champions Trophy, what still makes 50-over cricket relevant is the rivalry between top cricket-playing nations. If the India versus Pakistan rivalry set the temperature soaring because of the troubled histories of both nations, India versus Australia is another rivalry that is being fuelled by the quest to achieve excellence by both cricketing giants, especially in Test and ODI formats. And their fans anticipate with bated breath every time these teams take on each other because these encounters often turn into edge-of-the-seat thrillers. Ahead of the 2023 ODI World Cup final , let's embark on a journey to revisit some of the iconic ODI and Test battles between two proud cricketing nations. 1998 'Desert Storm' Before the events of April 1998, the legendary Sachin Tendulkar was known for his batting prowess and prodigious talent, but his unassuming on-field presence and docile approach never really elicited a belligerent response, even if the opposition bowlers had a go against him—sometimes verbally. But in a triangular series between India, Australia, and New Zealand in Sharjah, the latent aggression of Mumbaikar was unleashed in the most startling manner. Sachin showed he could boss one of the fiercest Aussie bowling attacks, which had the likes of Damien Fleming, Shane Warne, and Michael Kasprowicz, who bore the brunt of his new avatar. Sachin took the Australian bowlers to the cleaners at will, and the onslaught was later dubbed the 'Desert Storm in Sharjah.' He just went after the Australian attack as if his life depended upon it and tore them apart to amass 143 off 131 balls. The duel started only after a sandstorm delayed the match for half an hour, and India's revised target was 276; they required 235 to secure their berth in the final of the tri-nation series. India couldn't achieve the winning target, but Tendulkar's great innings was enough to take them to the finals due to a better net run rate than the Kiwis. In the finals, Tendulkar continued to unleash havoc on the Aussies, with another century translating into a title victory for Team India. 1999: Jadeja- Singh Duo Fell Short Australian batting powerhouse Mark Waugh played some terrific shots and went on to score 83 off 99 as Australia batted first in that World Cup game and scored 282/6. It was a must-win game for India, but the great Indian batting lineup couldn't live up to the expectations. Though Ajay Jadeja scored an unbeaten 100 off 138, he didn't get much support from the other end, except for a valiant 75 off 94 by Robin Singh. But the duo's effort wasn't good enough to get India past the target of 283; they were knocked out of the showpiece event by 77 runs. Besides Jadeja and Singh, other Indian batters lost their wickets with a single-digit score. Australia's pacer Glenn McGrath tormented India the most and finished the contest with 3/34. India's famous top three, comprising Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid scored 8,0,2, respectively, in that must-win contest. 2001: Eden Enigma for Aussies Australia came into the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with a 15-match Test winning streak, and they extended it after the Mumbai Test win. For the majority of cricket fans, it was a foregone conclusion that Australia were going to win the series in India, but a young team led by new captain Sourav Ganguly pulled off an extraordinary feat that took the rivalry up a few notches and produced some terrific memories of one of the greatest comebacks in sports history. Harbhajan Singh made his presence felt when he got a hat-trick - the first ever by an Indian bowler in Tests, but India were made to follow on. Then came an epic partnership between VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid, as the duo battled a ferocious Australian attack and Kolkata humidity to bat throughout the day, stitching a fifth-wicket stand of 376 and setting a target of 384 for Australia. Australia started off well, but soon Sachin Tendulkar opened up the floodgates by getting the wicket of opener Matthew Hayden, and then Harbhajan Singh bowled a magnificent spell to script a historic victory for India. The next Test in Chennai also had some heart-in-mouth moments when Matthew Hayden scored a double-century, but Harbhajan once again tormented the Australians, and India won the match by two wickets. 2003: Punter plunders India If there was ever a perfect example of a lull before the storm in cricketing folklore, it was in this contest. Australia captain Ricky Ponting showed why he was the best in business in those days. He took 74 balls to score his half-century with the help of just one boundary, but what followed after that simply decimated Team India. Having been sent in to bat first after India skipper Sourav Ganguly won the toss, the great Australian batting line-up got off to a flying start with openers Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden going after the Zaheer Khan-led Indian bowling attack, but that was just the shorter part of the nightmare for India, as captain Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn stitched a record 234-run partnership. Ponting remained unbeaten on 140 and thrashed all Indian bowlers as his last 90 runs came off in just 47 balls, in which he also hit Harbhajan Singh for consecutive sixes in the 39th over to stamp his authority over the match. India was completely outclassed in that contest, as Australia romped home with a 125-run victory and the third World Cup trophy after 1987 and 1999. The famous Indian batting line-up again proved feeble against the Australian attack, which was led by Glenn McGrath, who picked up three wickets. Sachin Tendulkar scored only 4 off 5 in that final, while Virender Sehwag emerged as the top scorer for India with 82 off 81. 2003-04: Dravid-Laxman at it again After tormenting Australia in 2001, Dravid and Laxman once again rose to the occasion in the epic Adelaide Test. After Australia scored 556 with the help of Ricky Ponting's 242, the Indian duo added 303 for the fifth wicket. Once the batters had their say, Ajit Agarkar produced one of the finest spells of his career, as he took 6 for 41 and India got a tricky target of 230. Rahul Dravid again showed his class and scored an unbeaten 72 to secure a memorable victory for India. Australia did bounce back by winning the Boxing Day Test despite Virender Sehwag's swashbuckling 195, but the decider at the SCG saw the peak of Indian batting as the visitors amassed 705 for 7. Sachin Tendulkar's unbeaten 241 and VVS Laxman's another classic innings of 178 gave India a big edge over the hosts. Australia came back strongly with centuries from Justin Langer and Simon Katich. But Rahul Dravid continued his dream run with 91 not out in the second innings which helped India set a target of 443. In the end, Simon Katich stood firm against India's relentless attack led by Anil Kumble to make it a memorable draw for Steve Waugh in his final Test. 2009: Sachin Show in Lost Cause It was a belter of a pitch in Hyderabad, and Ricky Ponting led the Australian side to a massive 350 for 4 after Shaun Marsh (112) and Shane Watson (93) punished the insipid Indian bowling line-up. But little master Sachin Tendulkar rose to the occasion and took the attack to the opposition. The Australian bowlers had a terrible time on the field. Tendulkar hammered the Australians to amass 141, but India fell short of victory by three runs. Suresh Raina also scored 59 in that contest, but it was Shane Watson's impressive bowling figures of 3/47 in 8.4 overs that made the crucial difference. It was a long series of seven One Day International matches, which Australia won by 4-2 as one contest was abandoned due to rain. There were a couple of close contests in that series, but overall it was an all-round performance by Australia that proved its might over India and also exposed many flaws in the batting and bowling of the home side. 2011 - Yuvi's All-round Heroics Before the start of the 2011 Cricket World Cup, many cricket pundits wrote off Yuvraj Singh because of his dwindling form, but the confident left-handed all-rounder took it as a challenge and made his presence felt in the marquee event by producing some magnificent results, which eventually led to India's title triumph. Yuvraj ticked all the boxes and showed his true prowess in the quarter-final, when he emerged as a sheet anchor for the team and scored an unbeaten 57 and also took two wickets, with R Ashwin and Zaheer Khan also taking two each to keep Australia's score below par at 260/6. Yuvraj's effort was complemented by Sachin Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir's half centuries, and India went on to beat Australia for the first time in a World Cup since 1983 to progress further in the tournament. During his playing days, Yuvraj always thrived under pressure, but he brought out his very best in the quarterfinals, which made a huge difference. 2015 - The Great Indian Collapse It was a high-expectation game of the 2015 World Cup. Team India was looking in a good position to test the mighty Aussies in their home, but that didn't happen. Australia's relentless bowling unit, featuring Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc and James Faulkner - simply outsmarted the Indian batters to storm into the semis with a 95-run win. Australia's in-form batter Steve Smith took the Indian bowlers to the cleaners and scored 105 off 93 as the hosts put 328 on board for the loss of seven wickets. The packed crowd in Sydney Cricket Ground, which had a huge number of fans rooting for the 'Men in Blue' that day, saw another Indian batting collapse as Captain MS Dhoni's score of 65 a run-a-ball was the only saving grace in that match. Other top names in that batting lineup were Virat Kohli , Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma and they scored 1, 45, 34 respectively. Eventually, Australia went on to win their fifth World Cup title. 2019 - Batting Bonanza On June 9, 2019, The Oval in London saw the very best of Indian batting as India's top order fired on all cylinders, with Shikhar Dhawan's century effort culminating in 117 off 109 balls, captain Virat Kohli scoring 82 off 77, and Rohit Sharma making 57 off 70. India's batting looked impervious in that contest, as they put 352 on board at the loss of five wickets. Australia made a fine start with opener David Warner scoring a half-century 56 off 84 balls and Steve Smith and Alex Carey also supported him with half-centuries, but in the end, that didn't prove enough. Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah both took three wickets each, and Australia were 316 all out. India's batting performance stole the show in that contest, as they had Aussie bowlers under pressure throughout the match. 2018-19: Kohli and Co scripted history India achieved the unthinkable on January 7, 2019, when Virat Kohli and his men became the first-ever Indian team to win a Test series in Down Under by beating Tim Paine-led side 2-1 in the four-match rubber. What started as an intriguing win in Adelaide would have easily ended with a 3-1 result for Team India if rain had not spoiled the Sydney Test. While the opening match was clearly dominated by bowlers, it was Chetaswar Pujara's gritty innings that decided the outcome of the next match. Australia did fight back in Perth as their opening pair got off to a fine start with a 112 partnership, but Virat Kohli gave a fitting reply with a century. In the end, India fell short to achieve the target. The Melbourne Test saw another dogged innings from Pujara who battled well for his 193 and was supported by Rishabh Pant's 159. Finally, Kuldeep Yadav's fifer grounded the great Australian side as Indian went on to win the series 2-1. 2020-21: Gabba Conquered Many came and tried their best, but the ‘Gabbatoir’ had the last laugh because the Brisbane Cricket Ground had emerged as the fortress of the Australian Cricket Team, where they had not lost a Test Match in 32 years. But on January 19, 2021, - India breached that fortress, with mercurial wicketkeeper batter Rishabh Pant leading the charge to make Australia pay for taking the hosts lightly. Before that feat, Australia had won 25 and drawn seven Tests in Gabba. In that series, India were in trouble with their long list of injuries and Shardul Thakur and Washington Sundar chipped in to revive India's innings but then Australia set a steep target of 328 for the final day. Once Shubman Gill and Pujara added 114 for the second wicket, it looked like an achievable target, and what followed after that made it another remarkable series win for India. Rishabh Pant just went after Australian bowlers as if it were a one-day game and wrote his name in history books by chasing down the target. "

AEW Full Gear 2023 advertised five championship matches. MJF defended the AEW World Heavyweight Championship against Jay White, and Hikaru Shida defended the AEW Women’s World Championship against Timeless Toni Storm, Orange Cassidy defended the AEW International Championship against Jon Moxley and Kris Statlander defended the TBS Championship against Julia Hart and Skye Blue. Last night’s broadcast of AEW Collision, which went head-to-head against WWE SmackDown, drew its lowest viewership ever with 251,000 viewers and just 92,000 in the 18-49 demographic. AEW Full Gear 2023 Results | November 18, 2023 AEW Full Gear 2023 Ticket Sales WWE To TNT?| Pro Wrestling Bits AEW Full Gear 2023 Winners and Grades Darby Allin, Sting And Edge Def. Christian Cage, Nick Wayne And Luchasaurus Christian Cage, AEW’s patriarch, had a children’s choir sing his song and it was a magnificent entrance. Sting, Edge and Darby Allin used their bats to touch tips for their entrance. Sting wore facepaint on half his face and looked like a Canadian Thunder Rosa. Ric Flair appeared ringside and was mocked by Nick Wayne, who also gave Flair the finger. Christian Cage teased a spear right in front of Edge and AEW production was able to capture this moment perfectly. Ric Flair took a terrifying bump from Christian Cage on the outside, meaning he’s one step closer to his ill-advised AEW in-ring return. Christian Cage accidentally struck Luchasaurus with the TNT Title, later absconding with the belt through the crowd. The Luchasaurus babyface turn is nigh. MJF’s leg was pillmanized following his successful AEW Tag Team Title defense. Tony Schiavone announced MJF would be unable to compete in the main event. Just as it seemed Jay White would be named the new AEW world champion, one-legged Adam Cole stepped up and took MJF’s spot. Orange Cassidy Def. Jon Moxley This begun as an epilogue to Moxley and Orange Cassidy’s last match as Moxley forged forward and dominated Cassidy early on. Moxley bit Orange Cassidy’s nose in the turnbuckle, and it reminded me of those old Goldust spots where he would kiss his opponents on the mouth. Like clockwork, Jon Moxley bled within the first five minutes of this match. With Moxley no-selling Cassidy’s offense, Cassidy’s typically low-energy kicks turned into Forrest Griffin leg kicks. Moxley continued to control the match, and the crowd was split between the two. Cassidy roared back with a furious comeback that ended in a Beach Break and a clean victory. Toni Storm Def. Hikaru Shida Of course, Toni Storm received a huge pop near her “hometown” of Los Angeles, Calif. Mariah May was shown backstage watching Toni Storm’s match and the announce team completely ignored her. Toni Storm easily tricked Aubrey Edwards to strike Hikaru Shida with a shoe behind Aubrey’s back. The finish to this match was ridiculous as Aubrey had to pretend that she didn’t see a frying pan that was hiding, in plain sights, in Storm’s trunks. Toni Storm is the new AEW women’s world champion and I’m expecting an acceptance speech. Ricky Starks And Big Bill Win Tag Team Ladder Match There was an early showdown between Big Bill and Brody King, and from then on, any time they would strike each other, the crowd would chant “meat!” Given his ECW background, I was surprised to learn that Taz has never been in a ladder match. Fans cheered on RUSH as he got all is stuff in. One of the best spots of the match was Cash Wheeler’s piledriver to Malakai Black. A bloodied Brody King in facepaint looked so terrifying. RUSH spent half his offense playing to the crowd, to the point where Excalibur asked “is he burning daylight?” The spot of the match was a Gonzo Bomb from Brody King on Dralistico. Julia Hart Def. Kris Statlander And Skye Blue Even though they had to follow a great tag team ladder match, Kris Statlander, Julia Hart and Skye Blue had no problem keeping the crowd interested throughout. Julia Hart hit an awkward-looking moonsault on Skye Blue for a nearfall. There was a great nearfall on Kris Statlander after Skye Blue hit an impressive Code Blue. Julia Hart won after stealing a pinfall from Kris Statlander shortly after Kris hit the Saturday Night Fever. Will Ospreay Signs With AEW AEW signed another “best in the world” prototype. For more information, click here. Swerve Strickland Def. Hangman Adam Page Prince Nana did his dance with a dance team, and if this doesn’t get whole crowds to do the dance, nothing will. Both Hangman Adam Page and Swerve Strickland were bleeding profusely, as expected. Midway through this violent death match, the ring mat looked like a crime scene. Hangman earned “you sick f—k” chants for literally drinking Swerve’s blood. Hangman Adam Page hit a moonsault while holding a barbed-wire wrapped chair. A bloodthirsty Forum came to its feet when Swerve answered a 10-count, because that meant the match would continue. Swerve hit Page with the barbed-wired chair and the barbed-wire got caught in poor Hangman’s hair and face. Hangman fought off outside interference from Brian Cage and Prince Nana, but back came Swerve with a cinderblock shot to the back. Swerve won by hanging the Hangman with a chain. Golden Jets Def. The Young Bucks Don Callis appeared on commentary, not because he’s aligned with the Young Bucks, but because he hates Kenny Omega that much. Fans were behind hometown favorites Young Bucks, but not to the degree where they felt like the babyfaces. The Young Bucks cheated throughout this match to hammer home the point that they were, in fact, the heels. Kenny Omega teased turning on Chris Jericho, only to deliver the V-Trigger to the Young Bucks. Kenny Omega won the match with a One Winged Angle, leading to a biblical temper tantrum from the Young Bucks. MJF Def. Jay White The announce team teased that this match was going to be a massacre due to Adam Cole’s injury. Bryce Remsburg couldn’t hide his disgust while holding up the AEW World Title. Nigel McGuinness suggested this should be a Last Man Standing Match. Just when the match was about to begin, MJF commandeered an ambulance vehicle and showed up at the last minute. Of course, the story of the match was Jay White working over MJF’s injured left leg. Excalibur said MJF’s injury had taken the air out of the Kia Forum, but with the pay-per-view approaching 5 hours (including Zero Hour), I think these people were just tired. MJF added to the long list of talent on this show that wore purple and gold to kiss up to this LA crowd. The announce table collapsed prematurely as MJF put Jay White on it. MJF went for the flying elbow anyway, and the crowd politely chanted “holy s—t.” MJF really earned the “holy s—t” chants with a running RKO to the outside. AEW continues to have protocol issues with doctors both in and out of kayfabe. This time, MJF flipped off Dr. Samson as the doctor tried to check on his storyline injury. Adam Cole teased throwing in the towel to add another layer of drama to this match. Jay White managed to intercept, not one, but two foreign objects from Adam Cole. Very sus."

He shared his memories with the BBC. A two-year-old boy stands next to a lifeguard boat, his mother captures the moment in a black and white photograph. Decades later, he is beaming proudly at the camera, a British Empire Medal pinned to his chest in recognition of his years of saving lives at sea for the RNLI. ""I guess it was inevitable I'd be on the lifeboat,"" Geoff says with a laugh, as he shows off his mum's old picture. He grew up in Cullercoats on the north-east coast and enjoyed a childhood of ""messing about with boats"". Geoff was 14 or 15 when he helped with his first RNLI rescue - too young to officially enrol but not to get stuck in. ""I was with my boat on the beach and saw the lifeboat station doors open, so went to have a look,"" Geoff recalls, from the comfort of one of the large sofas in the crew's lounge. There was one man on duty when the call came in, bearing the news that two canoeists had capsized beyond the harbour wall. ""It was just me and this guy, and he said 'give us a hand' - so I did,"" Geoff recalls. After that successful rescue he was always going to become an official part of the crew, enlisting in 1973 after he turned 16. ""It was a natural thing for me to do,"" Geoff says, adding: ""It was a chance to be around boats and help people. ""These lifeboat volunteers were looked up to as heroes."" He continued volunteering alongside his day job as a marine engineer officer in the Merchant Navy, and later, running his own company specialising in power generation. He spent 15 years on Cullercoats' inshore boat, before being headhunted by nearby Tynemouth to be a mechanic and deputy coxswain on their larger Arun class, all-weather craft. After retiring from going out on rescues in 2002, he returned to Cullercoats to take up the role of water safety officer. Over that time he has seen huge changes in the training and technology, as well as the types of call-outs. The vast majority used to be to stricken fishing vessels, but now it is almost all leisure-based call-outs, such as swimmers, paddleboarders and kayakers, as well as a worrying rise in so-called ""despondent persons"". A lot of the jobs were ""mundane"", he says, involving the towing of broken-down boats. But some do stick in the memory, for both good and terrible reasons. In 1999, a yacht on a corporate away-day pitch-poled as it returned to the Tyne from a North Sea swelled by big easterly winds. Three people were hurled into the frothing waters, one having been smashed through the yacht's windshield. Geoff had seen it heading seaward earlier and wondered if he might get a call about it. He was part of the crew that hauled the trio who fell overboard out of the river but, despite CPR efforts, two of them died. ""It's a sad fact of life, but at the end of the day not every rescue is going to be successful, ""Geoff says. ""In your own mind you do look back and think 'is there anything I could have done better'? Could I have got there quicker, done a better job of the CPR?',"" he adds. ""We have got to say we did our best, and what more could we have done?"" As a water safety officer, Geoff's role is to make people as aware as possible of the dangers of the sea and how best to mitigate them. He can remember a lot of ""daft and stupid"" things with a mixture of humour and frustration. Like a couple paddle-boarding at Tynemouth with their 18-month-old child a year or two ago. The man had fallen in the water and was unable to get back on his board, the woman was shouting at the lifeboat crew to get their child who was not wearing buoyancy aid. Or there was the boat owner who went out three weekends in a row and on each occasion suffered engine failure and had to be towed back in. ""We talk about safety at sea but is there actually such a thing?,"" Geoff says, alluding to the inherent dangers of open waters. He said there had been a massive rise in swimmers in the bays around Cullercoats and some had to be spoken to about the risks they were taking, citing several who wanted to swim at Whitley Bay during the recent Storm Babet. ""At the end of the day, it's up to each person,"" says Geoff. ""We can say 'we do not think that's a wise thing to do', but we can't stop them. ""They do not know what they do not know."" In his early days Geoff was kitted out in boots and oilskins. ""You were always soaking wet before you'd even started,"" he says, with a laugh. Drysuits arrived in the mid 1980s, but there were only three or four for the whole crew to share. Now every volunteer has their own kit carefully arranged in the locker room, ready to be put on within a minute. Each crew member is also fitted with a beacon which, in the event of them ending up overboard, should lead rescuers right to them. ""It's a bit different from when I started,"" Geoff says, reminiscing about the light on their vest which lit up in the water and would be the only visual aid to show someone's location. Although he spends his time onshore now, teaching water safety - part of which included recording a podcast dedicated to Cullercoats - he still feels the same ""adrenalin rush"" when the alarm is raised. ""You think, 'how quickly can I get down there?,"" he says, adding: ""And then you could be there 10 minutes or 10 hours. ""A lot of calls get cancelled or it's put down as a false call with good intent, which is where someone thinks there is a problem and reports it but there isn't. ""We don't mind that at all. We would much rather people called than didn't."" It's not easy for the crew's families stuck on shore awaiting news though, Geoff says, adding they ""deserve medals"". He and fellow volunteer Brian Reeds, who has clocked up 40 years working for the RNLI, start discussing the ""heart-breaking"" Penlee disaster of 1981. Eight Cornish RNLI crew and eight people from a stricken cargo ship were killed in fierce waves and hurricane winds. ""The coastguard was trying to call them on the radio and there was just deadly silence,"" Brian says. It devastated the whole RNLI family across the country, Geoff says, but he adds: ""If you think about these things too much, you probably would not go. ""But then there is a risk crossing the road. ""We do not think about it until afterwards."" Now Geoff enjoys passing on his experience to the new volunteers, many of whom work land-based jobs these day, unlike the fishermen volunteers who formed and ran the lifeboat at the outset. ""In 200 years we have gone from rowing boats, which if they capsized meant game over, to self-righting boats than can reach 25 knots,"" Geoff says. ""Who knows how we will be doing it in another 50 years, but the motivation will be the same - to save lives at sea."" Follow BBC North East on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

From October 2022 to March 2023, the state was blasted by 31 atmospheric rivers—colossal bands of water vapor that form above the Pacific and become firehoses when they reach the West Coast. What surprised climate scientists wasn’t the number of storms, but their strength and rat-a-tat frequency. The downpours shocked a water system that had just experienced the driest three years in recorded state history, causing floods, mass evacuations, and at least 22 deaths. Swinging betweenwet and dry extremesis typical for California, but last winter’s rain, potentially intensified by climate change, was almost unmanageable. Add to that the arrival of El Niño, and more extreme weather looks likely for the state. This is going to make life very difficult for the dam operators tasked with capturing and controlling much of the state’s water. Like most of the world’s 58,700 large dams, those in California were built for yesterday’s more stable climate patterns. But as climate change taxes the world’s water systems—affecting rainfall, snowmelt, and evaporation—it’s getting tough to predict how much water gets to a dam, and when. Dams are increasingly either water-starved, unable to maintain supplies of power and water for their communities, or overwhelmed and forced to release more water than desired—risking flooding downstream. But at one major dam in Northern California, operators have been demonstrating how to not just weather these erratic and intense storms, but capitalize on them. Management crews at New Bullards Bar, built in 1970, entered last winter armed with new forecasting tools that gave unprecedented insight into the size and strength of the coming storms—allowing them to strategize how to handle the rain. First, they let the rains refill their reservoir, a typical move after a long drought. Then, as more storms formed at sea, they made the tough choice to release some of this precious hoard through their hydropower turbines, confident that more rain was coming. “I felt a little nervous at first,” says John James, director of resource planning at Yuba Water Agency in northern California. Fresh showers soon validated the move. New Bullards Bar ended winter with plumped water supplies, a 150 percent boost in power generation, and a clean safety record. The strategy offers a glimpse of how better forecasting can allow hydropower to adapt to the climate age. Modeling studies have long suggested that better weather forecasts would be invaluable for dam managers. Now this is being confirmed in real life. New Bullards Bar is one of a half-dozen pilot sites teaming up with the US Army Corps of Engineers to test how cutting-edge forecasting can be used to optimize operations in the real world. Early tests of the methods, called forecast-informed reservoir operations, have given operators the confidence to hold 5-20 percent reserve margins beyond their reservoirs’ typical capacity, says Cary Talbot, who heads the initiative for the Army Corps."

The boat, later found to have been overloaded, had between 150 and 200 passengers on board when it departed from Lokon Village in Minna, Niger State, for Warrah Market in Kebbi State.The boat was said to have hit an object inside the river around 8:15 am. Sadly, the severity of the impact caused the boat to break into two and sink. According to reports, the passengers were mostly women and children, travelling to Warrah to sell food items in the market. It also had some miners on board.The exact number of passengers could not be ascertained because the boat was said to have picked passengers along the way. However, it was later gathered that the boat was an old, rickety, wooden boat with a capacity of between 80 and 150 passengers.In addition to being overloaded with passengers, reports said the boat also carried sandbags. When it capsized, only about 26 persons were said to have been rescued alive while search and rescue operation only led to the discovery of 76 bodies. The rest of the passengers were declared missing.Despite the articulated condolence messages and proposed action plans that often greet the accidents, they have yet to abate.On June 13, 2023, no fewer than 150 persons were confirmed dead when a boat carrying passengers returning from a wedding party capsized. The passengers were said to be going from Niger State to Kwara State when the incident happened. The cause of the accident was unknown, but many others went missing apart from those who died.Less than a month earlier, no fewer than 15 girls were reported dead in Sokoto State after a fatal boat accident at Dandeji village in the Shagari Local Government Area of the state.The girls were said to have been on their way to a nearby bush to fetch firewood when the boat, carrying over 40 girls, capsized.In fact, a compilation bySaturday PUNCHas reported on July 1, 2023 indicated that boat accidents caused by head-on collisions, speeding and overloading claimed no fewer than 3,133 lives between January 2013 and June 2023.The report also showed that Niger, Rivers and Bayelsa states have the highest number of accidents, while in coastal Rivers and Bayelsa states, there were over 557 deaths, with over 112 unaccounted for, as their bodies were never recovered.In Niger State, from 2013 to date, there were about 24 boat accidents, which led to the death of over 332 persons, including women and children.A document from the Niger State Emergency Management Agency office shows that in the last four weeks, 53 persons drowned in six different boat accidents in four local government areas of Shiroro, Mokwa, Agwara and Borgu. It added that the victims were made up of more women and children.According to the document, Mokwa had the highest, with 30 deaths, followed by Borgu, 10, Agwara, eight and Shiroro, five. It is instructive to note that these were the bodies recovered, excluding those that were not recovered.Adamawa State also has a similar sad story, with three boat accidents in eight days, claiming the lives of over a dozen persons.Specifically, on September 4, a canoe travelling between Mayo-Ine and Mayobelwa in Mayobelwa LGA floundered, killing two of its passengers. Four days later, another one occurred, involving a canoe conveying 23 traders and farmers from Rugange village to Yola town via the Njuwa Lake at Dandu village. In the accident, 15 people reportedly drowned.As if that was not enough, three days later as rescue workers were struggling to recover the corpses of missing persons from the Njuwa Lake, another boat with dozens of passengers was said to have capsized following a strong wind in Gurin, Fufore LGA. Local divers reportedly rescued 11 persons while many more could not be accounted for.Unveiling the cause of the accidentsThe Adamawa State Emergency Management Agency boss, Muhammad Sulaiman, listed overloading, disregard for bad weather and non-usage of life jackets as factors responsible for the accidents. He however said the government was working to enforce safety measures to prevent recurrence.Governor Ahmadu Fintiri had also ordered all relevant agencies to enforce safety standards, including placing a ban on overloading and ensuring the use of life jackets on the waterways. He further called on traditional rulers and local government councils to support his administration in preventing further loss of lives due to negligence and disregard for safety rules.Related NewsHe stated, “I want to draw attention to the dangers of using a canoe without life jackets or those who travel without an engine to drive it, especially during storms or downpours. We should know life is better than money. I direct all relevant agencies to regulate water transportation.“We will provide life jackets at every point where people are transported. Traditional rulers should ensure that a canoe with the capacity to accommodate 10 persons is restricted to only 10 persons. What we saw in Rugange and Gurin is enough to serve as a lesson to us. We will not wait to come for condolence after loss of life. We will prevent it without fear or favour.”Meanwhile, a former fisherman and boat driver in the state, Danlami Adahnu, identified greed on the part of transporters as a major cause of the frequent accidents on the waterways.He stressed that during storms, a wise skipper would reduce the number of passengers below the boat’s capacity, to avoid capsizing. “The best way to prevent accidents is to avoid overloading, because during the rainy season, water waves are strong and very fast, so a wise canoe man (skipper) would reduce the number of passengers even below the capacity of the canoe to avoid capsizing,” he said.Also, speaking about the cause of the May 2021 tragedy, the Director-General, NSEMA, Salihu Garba, said the accident was due to water hyacinth and heavy wind.Way outAsked what could be done to stem the tide of boat accidents, NSEMA spokesman, Ibrahim, said improved enforcement of safety guidelines and provision of support and intervention by the government were necessary.He stated, “Strict monitoring, enforcement of regulations, providing safety measures for people and providing assistance for them to help them construct new canoes.“Some of the canoes are very small, some are old and some are rickety. Some of the operators also don’t have money. Government should put them into cooperatives and provide funds for them to put into their businesses which they will refund to the government.“That is part of what government should do; by also providing more modern canoes and giving to them at subsidised rates; giving them more life jackets at subsidised rates; ensuring more officials of the Inland Waterways monitor the operators; Search and Rescue officials should be on the alert so that if anything untoward happens at any time, they can respond quickly to save lives.”Reacting to reports that a former Niger State governor bought ferries for them and that they were misused, he stated, “The ferries were in just three places. We have one in Pateji, one in Agwara and one in Lafiaji. We have 579 communities in the riverine areas and the location the ferries are is not up to five locations.“So, what happens in those places where they are using water as their means of transportation? There should be more ferries. Government should encourage them by providing them with soft loans or constructing canoes and giving to them at subsidised rates, including life jackets.These, he said, were the only ways to solve the problems, adding, “You ask them to buy new canoes, but they don’t have the money. Some people even find it difficult to eat. Some of the vehicles on our roads are also not roadworthy, likewise the roads. So, what is happening in the waterways sector is still happening on the roads.”He called on the government to show more interest in public transportation and not leave it to individuals, who might be driven by profits.He noted that new persons had been recruited based on the recent disaster, including local divers and boat owners, to serve as waterways disaster response guard. He said they would be trained and equipped and that safety rules would be enforced.“These people will be posted to the different water boarding points across the state for enforcement of safety regulations and search and rescue operations, which are the ways we intend to reduce boat accidents,” he added.The state’s Commissioner for Information, Binta Mammam, toldSaturday PUNCHin an interview that the government was working to reduce boat accidents in the state through the provision of life jackets, increased awareness and enforcement of safety rules.She noted that relief materials had been provided for victims of previous accidents while life jackets were provided for the people.She lamented that in Mokwa and Agwara, life jackets were provided for the people, in addition to enlightenment on the need to use them, but that people don’t use them. “At Mokwa and Agwara, life jackets were sent earlier but the problem is that these people don’t use the life jackets, and sometimes there is negligence from owners of the boat,” she added.“A boat that is supposed to take 10 or 15 passengers will sometimes end up taking up to 50 passengers. Those are the challenges we face, but we pray that with the sensitisation, the accidents will reduce.“If the passengers have life jackets on and any incident happens, at least a call will be put through for help, and before anyone drowns help would have arrived. But if you don’t use a life jacket, there will be no chances of survival.”She stressed that while the government was available to intervene, overloading, use of boats in bad shape would no longer be tolerated.“There are times when many boats overload and still carry motorcycles, animals and other heavy loads. I think the security agencies will now come to guide them against this. I don’t understand why people keep repeating the same things that have caused accidents year in, year out. The sensitisation will continue until we get it right, Mammam added. When did boat accidents start in northern states?” our correspondent asked the spokesperson for the Niger State Emergency Management Agency, Hussain Ibrahim.After a brief silence, he said, “Well, I’m sure these accidents started before I was born, because our people have been commuting on waterways as a means of transportation long before I was born.”According to him, the spate of boat accidents was unfortunate.Indeed, while it’s difficult to say exactly when the first boat accident was recorded in the country, it is clear however that from the North to the South, many lives have been lost while some remain unaccounted, sadly.On May 26, 2021, for example, what could pass for a national tragedy occurred in Niger State when more than 150 persons reportedly lost their lives to an accident.

Authorities say severe weather conditions, characterised by heavy rain and gale-force winds from the east, pose a significant threat to communities and infrastructure in several countries. The gale-force winds have struck hardest in the eastern part of Denmark's Jutland peninsula, including the Danish islands in the Baltic Sea. However, the British Isles, southern Sweden, northern Germany, and parts of Norway are also enduring the impact of this formidable storm, named Babet by the UK's Met Office. Scandinavia sees high water levels In southern Denmark, low-lying areas are submerged, and fallen trees have littered the landscape. The Danish Meteorological Institute's ""very dangerous weather"" warning predicts that water levels will rise, with some inland Danish areas expected to see river surges up to 240cm above normal. “The large amount of water is now on its way back through the Danish belts, which, however, act as bottlenecks, where the water has difficulty moving through and thus piles up south of here.” The DMI stated on the front page of its website. “The strong easterly wind also contributes to the elevated water level and worsens the situation so that the water level becomes even higher.” Sweden is also grappling with the risk of extensive flooding along its southern coast, potentially causing limited access to roads and railways. However, the situation is expected to improve on Saturday morning as water levels recede. Norway has not been spared, with a bridge near its second-largest city closed and widespread cancellations in ferry and air travel, leading to delays and disruptions. First death in UK as much of the country elevates to amber warning In the United Kingdom, a rare red weather alert, signifying the highest level of warning, was issued for parts of Scotland. Authorities predicted ""exceptional rainfall"" in the following days, resulting in extensive flooding and a significant risk to life due to fast-flowing or deep floodwater. This marks the first red alert in the UK since 2020. The affected regions in Scotland have already experienced evacuations, school closures, and widespread disruption. Storm Babet has already claimed its first fatality as a woman was swept into a river in Scotland amid gale-force winds and flooding. Amber warnings for wind and rain have been issued for parts of northern England, the Midlands, and northern Wales. Northern Ireland is also under a yellow warning. The Environment Agency's Flood line service has issued multiple flood warnings and alerts in England, particularly in areas around Bristol, the Midlands, and Yorkshire, with additional warnings along the east coast. Northern Ireland is under a yellow rain warning, and Scotland faces amber and yellow warnings for rain and wind. Major roads, including sections of the A9 and A90, have been closed due to flooding, and train services in affected areas have been suspended. Ferry services to various islands and regional air flights are also cancelled. The Met Office's weather warnings now encompass nearly all of the UK's eastern seaboard, with rain and wind warnings extending from Essex to Berwick and northwards into Scotland. As Storm Babet continues its destructive path across northern Europe, authorities are tirelessly working to safeguard lives and mitigate the extensive damage caused by the extreme weather."

It's the foul-smelling runoff from processing the 80-meter (260-foot) factory ship's valuable catch: Antarctic krill, a paper-clip-sized crustacean central to the region's food web and, scientists say, an important buffer to global warming.""What's coming out of the side are the remnants of the ecosystem,"" says Alistair Allan, an activist for Australia'sBob Brown Foundation, as he looks on from the inflatable boat. ""If this was off the coast of Alaska, it would be a national park. But since it's down here at the bottom of the world, where no one is watching, you have ships almost running into whales feeding on the same things they're fishing.""While krill fishing is banned in U.S. waters due to concerns it could impact whales, seals and other animals that feed on the shrimp-like creatures, it's been taking place for decades in Antarctica, where krill are most abundant. It started in the 1960s, when the Soviet Union launched an industrial fleet of trawlers in search of an untapped protein source that could be canned like sardines.Sea Shepherd Global's Allankay breaks a wave as the ship sails through the Drake Passage in the Southern Ocean, on March 3, 2023.

Credit: AP Photo/David KeytonSurging demand for nutrient-rich krill—for feeding farm-raised fish, omega-3 pills, pet food and protein shakes—combined with advances in fishing and the still unknown impact from climate change has some scientists warning the fishery is at a critical juncture and in urgent need of stricter controls. But any further action is mired in geopolitical wrangling as Russia and China look to quickly expand the catch.Two Associated Press journalists spent more than two weeks at sea in March, at the tail end of the Southern Hemisphere's summer, aboard the Dutch-flagged Allankay, operated by the conservation groupSea Shepherd Global, to take a rare, up-close look at the world's southernmost fishery.It's a harvest that by its very nature operates at the extremes—hundreds of miles from any port.Starting every December, around 10 to 12 mostly Norwegian and Chinese vessels brave the rough seas whipping across the tip of South America to descend upon the South Orkney Islands, a desolate chain of rocky outcrops. From there, as temperatures warm, the fleet follows the massive swarms of krill toward the South Pole, fishing at the foundation of the fragile ecosystem's food web.A krill fishing ship transfers its haul onto a cargo vessel in the Southern Ocean off the coast of the South Orkney Islands, north of the Antarctic Peninsula, on March 9, 2023. Fishing vessels can operate for long periods of time without returning to a port due to at-sea transhipments like this. Credit: AP Photo/David KeytonUnder a conservation agreement developed almost two decades ago,the krill catch has soared: from 104,728 metric tons in 2007 to 415,508 metric tons in 2022, as larger, more sophisticated vessels have joined the chase. Those levels were below internationally agreed conservation limits.A U.S.-led coalition has been calling for more restrictions and marine reserves as krill's vital role as food for other species and in removing large amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere comes into focus. But it has met stiff opposition from China and Russia, which have made no secret of their geopolitical ambitions in the white continent.Direct competition with marine mammals seems inevitable—a reality dramatically underscored when four juvenile humpback whales were entangled by a Norwegian krill boat in 2021 and 2022.While the end of commercial whaling has allowed populations to rebound, a new study by the University of California, Santa Cruz found thatpregnancy rates among humpback whalesin Antarctica have been falling sharply—possibly due to a lack of krill, their main prey.

Collected on a U.S. icebreaker, they fuel her research at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. On a recent visit, a technician unscrews one of the jars, empties the formaldehyde and rinses the krill under running water, a dozen fitting in the palm of his hand.Tiny but bountiful, Antarctic krill make up one of the planet's largest biomasses, nourishing everything from fish to marine mammals and seabirds.""All those iconic images we associate with Antarctica of whales, seals and penguins—it's a megafauna hotspot, and it's because of krill,"" Steinberg said.Lesser known is krill's important role fighting climate change.Every year, krill remove as much as 23 megatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, according to new research published by the World Wildlife Fund. That's the equivalent of taking off the road 5 million cars every year.A member of the crew of Sea Shepherd Global's Allankay ship takes a photo of an iceberg in the Southern Ocean on March 5, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/David KeytonThe carbon cleansing starts with phytoplankton that absorb greenhouse gases burned by humans, says Emma Cavan, a biologist at Imperial College London who co-authoredthe report. Krill feed on the microscopic plants and then transport fertilizing nutrients to the ocean floor in the form of waste and their molting shells.""Antarctic krill are worth more to nature and people left in the ocean than removed or lost through sea ice disappearance,"" said Cavan, who recently submitted her estimates for peer review.Krill aren't just a bulwark against climate change—they're victims, too.At Steinberg's lab, researchers are examining how warming oceans—Antarctic krill need water colder than 4 degrees Celsius (39 Fahrenheit) to survive—are altering krill's life cycle. It's a task made more urgent by a record loss in sea ice this year.The Chinese fishing vessel Shen Lan operates in the Southern Ocean off the coast of the South Orkney Islands, north of the Antarctic Peninsula, on March 6, 2023. Starting every December, around 10 to 12 mostly Norwegian and Chinese vessels brave the rough seas whipping across the tip of South America to descend upon the South Orkney Islands, a desolate chain of rocky outcrops. From there, as temperatures warm, the fleet follows the massive swarms of krill toward the South Pole, fishing at the foundation of the fragile ecosystem’s food web. Credit: AP Photo/David KeytonAlready, in the northernmost stretches of Antarctica where fishing activity is concentrated, populations have declined as krillmigrate toward cooler waterscloser to the South Pole, according to Steinberg. Other scientists sayfurther research is required, questioning whether there's evidence for a shift poleward and, if there is one, the cause of it.""There are surprises all the time,"" Steinberg said. ""And the fact that we are still learning about the effects of ocean warming on the population means we need to be very, very cautious.""REGULATING KRILLMuch of the fight over krill is taking place thousands of miles away from the fishing grounds, in a former 19th century boarding school on the Australian island of Tasmania. It's there, in the headquarters of theCommission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, that delegates from 27 member states are gathering this month to continue negotiations over a long overdue refresh of the krill management plan.A whale breaches the surface of the Southern Ocean in front of mountains on the Antarctica Peninsula on March 15, 2023. While krill fishing is banned in U.S. waters due to concerns it could impact whales, seals and other animals that feed on the shrimp-like creatures, it’s been taking place for decades in Antarctica, where krill are most abundant. Credit: AP Photo/David KeytonThe organization, established by treaty in 1982, has emerged as a model for science-based cooperation on the high seas—lawless waters that comprise nearly half the planet.But even some of the group's boosters say it has failed to take into account the effects of climate change.""CCAMLR's mandate is conservation—it's right there in the name,"" said Claire Christian, executive director of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, a Washington-based group that represents environmental organizations at CCAMLR proceedings. ""It's not to enable fishing.""One reason for the stalling is geopolitical wrangling. At the organization's last annual meeting, Russia and China blocked a proposal by the U.S. that wouldrestrict potentially dangerous unloading of krillat sea to cargo vessels. Moscow and Beijing are also pushing to expand fishing more quickly and in June teamed up to sink a proposal for aTexas-sized reservealong the Antarctic Peninsula, an area teeming with wildlife and tourists.The captain of Sea Shepherd Global's Allankay works on the bridge of the ship on March 3, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/David KeytonThe quarreling threatens to undermine conservation goals because all decisions must be unanimous. Currently, less than 5% of the Southern Ocean is protected—well behind CCAMLR's target and not nearly enough to meet a United Nations goal to preserve 30% of the world's oceans by 2030.But with quotas likely to increase under any new management system some see a silver lining in the deadlock.""The irony is that if certain members aren't agreeing to the new framework, the catch limit won't change,"" said Dirk Welsford, an Australian government researcher who chairs CCAMLR's scientific committee. ""It would require a nation to go rogue.""CRUDE TO KRILL OILThe Antarctic Provider lords over the loading dock at the port of Montevideo, Uruguay, dwarfing semi-trucks and forklifts that race around the 168-meter (550-foot) cargo ship that gathers krill from vessels at sea.

Chinstrap penguins and fur seals face similar stresses. Credit: AP Photo/David KeytonThis is the first stop on krill's journey from remote wilderness to international commodity. From this South American hub, shipments of whole dried krill spread across the globe—to feed processors and salmon farms in Europe, Canada and Australia, pet food manufacturers in China and a former ice cream factory in Houston which produces 80% of the world's krill oil.Dominating that supply chain is Aker BioMarine, a Norwegian companyresponsible for about 70% of the global krill catchby volume. It's also driving innovation, having recently introduced continuous fishing with long, cylindrical nets attached to vacuums that have the capacity to suck up 1,200 metric tons of krill per day, although the company says its most advanced ship currently averages about 500 metric tons per day—the equivalent daily diet for about 150 humpback whales.The company touts its environmental stewardship. Among other initiatives, it funds marine research, supports the creation ofmarine reservesand says it has reduced its carbon emissions by 50% in the last decade. It also boasts theindustry's top eco-labelfor sustainability.A seal walks on the shore next to a rusting remnant of the whaling industry on Deception Island close to the Antarctic Peninsula on March 16, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/David KeytonBut when it comes to fishing in Antarctica, emotions run high.""Some people believe we shouldn't fish at all, we should all be vegetarians, we shouldn't be in Antarctica,"" CEO Matts Johansen said in an interview near Oslo, Norway, arguing that krill is a sustainable source of protein for a growing global population. ""There is no single solution.""Johansen said fears of an explosion in fishing are misplaced as the industry isn't even catching all that's allowed. He sees consolidation, not growth, in the industry because of the huge investments required.""If you look at our numbers over the last 15 years, it's not very good advertising,"" Johansen said, noting that his company has been unprofitable.Aker BioMarine's financial wherewithal depends on another, cruder type of oil: Norway's massive natural gas and petroleum exports.A bird flies past as snow falls on the Norwegian Aker BioMarine's Antarctic Endurance ship operating in the Southern Ocean off the coast of the South Orkney Islands, north of the Antarctic Peninsula, on March 8, 2023.

In addition to speeding up growth, krill contains astaxanthin, a pigment that gives salmon a pinker color.""The fish love it,"" said Brett Glencross, technical director ofIFFO, a trade organization for the marine ingredients industry. ""It's like dipping your Brussels sprouts in chocolate to get kids to eat their vegetables.""Fish farming is big business—about half of the world's seafood is now farm raised as the oceans have been emptied of wild-caught fish.In this image from video provided by Sea Shepherd Global, the Norwegian Aker Biomarine's Antarctic Endeavour krill fishing ship sails near a whale in the Southern Ocean on March 6, 2023.

""When I have an entire pantry to work with, there's more flexibility.""KRILL OIL PILLSBeyond feeding seafood, Aker BioMarine's big push is selling krill oil capsules, which were introduced in the early 2000s, amid growing interest in omega-3 fatty acid supplements and their purported role in promoting heart, brain and joint health.It describes its mission of placing pills on the shelves of drug stores around the world with almost evangelical fervor.A chipstrap penguin jumps from an iceberg into the Southern Ocean on March 9, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/David Keyton""We're in business toimprove human and planetary health,"" boasts a recent presentation for investors.But the jury is out on how effective they are. And omega-3 supplements—krill or otherwise—haven't been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, according to the National Institutes of Health.Johansen says studies show krill oil contains healthbenefits not found in traditional fish oil, including fat molecules that Aker BioMarine says make it easier to deliver omega-3 to the brain, heart and liver. It also contains choline, an essential nutrient for regulating memory and mood.""Krill is packed with important nutrients so that we can stay healthy, live long and contribute to society,"" said Johansen.William Harris, a professor at the University of South Dakota who helped invent atest that measures fatty acidsin red blood cells, said he's ""agnostic"" about where people get their omega-3.This photo made by a CCAMLR observer shows the carcass of a humpback whale floating free soon after release from a net during krill trawling by the Norwegian fishing company Aker BioMarine in the Southern Ocean on April 20, 2021.

In addition, he said many common foods, like eggs or mushrooms, are loaded in choline in orders of magnitude more than krill pills.Krill also typically contains lower levels of omega-3s than fish, so more must be harvested to have the same fat content, according toGOED, a Salt Lake City, Utah-based group representing the omega-3 industry.INDUSTRY CHANGESCriticism of the krill fishery's management and environmental toll has spurred some reform.In the absence of more stringent regulation, the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies, whose members are responsible for 90% of the krill taken from Antarctica, adopted in 2018 a number of self-imposed restrictions.They include thecreation of no-take zones near the Antarctic Peninsulathat overlap with penguin breeding colonies. The group has also agreed with calls from groups including thePew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy Projectto come up with stricter rules on at-sea transfers of catch between vessels and the study of climate change on krill.This photo made by a CCAMLR observer aboard Aker BioMarine's ship, the Antarctic Sea, in April 2021, shows birds on the surface of the water next to the carcass of a humpback whale caught in a net during krill trawling by the Norwegian fishing company Aker BioMarine in the Southern Ocean on April 20, 2021. Credit: MRAG via APStill, the group thinks quotas could be much higher.It points out that currently less than 1% of the estimated 60 million metric tons of krill found in the main Antarctic fishing grounds—an area larger than the U.S.—is being caught. That leaves the remaining 99% for whales and other animals.""If you look at those numbers, it's clear we could fish more,"" said Javier Arata, a Chilean trained biologist who heads the industry group.However, a leading marine biologist the industry once relied on to burnish its environmental credentials has since denounced krill fishing.Helena Herr, who studies whales at the University of Hamburg, was invited in 2021 by Arata's group to serve on an advisory panel. She accepted with the hope that she could help mitigate the effects of krill fishing on the Antarctic ecosystem.China's Long Fa fishing vessel is followed by flocks of seabirds in the Southern Ocean off the coast of the South Orkney Islands, north of the Antarctic Peninsula, on March 10, 2023.

They just relocate it,"" she said in an interview. ""People claim they know about biomass and the distribution of krill. But the data is based on such vague assumptions that we don't really know what we're doing.""The Norwegian Aker BioMarine's Antarctic Sea trawls for krill in the Southern Ocean off the coast of the South Orkney Islands, north of the Antarctic Peninsula, on March 10, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/David KeytonOthers have similar doubts.Whole Foods, the supermarket chain that prides itself on sustainable sourcing and is now owned by Amazon,pulled krill pills from its shelvesin 2010 over concerns about the fishery's environmental impact. And the World Wildlife Fund, which between 2007 and 2017 partnered with Aker BioMarine, lending its panda logo to promote the company's products, has recently lodged concerns about the industry's continued certification.Aker BioMarine in apromotional videosays the amount of bycatch—unwanted fish and marine species other than krill—that it unintentionally nets on one of its ships in an entire year would fit into a ""small bucket."" However, data it reported to CCAMLR put that the amount of annual bycatch—although small compared to other trawl fisheries—in the order of several metric tons per ship.The Norwegian Aker BioMarine's Antarctic Provider unloads its haul at a port in Montevideo, Uruguay, on Feb. 21, 2023.

""The key message that we're trying to convey, and maybe it's oversimplified in that picture of a bucket, is the bycatch in the krill fishery is extremely low,"" he said.The stakes are high.In 2021, three juvenilehumpback whales became entangledin a net used by Aker BioMarine's Antarctic Sea within the span of two months.Following these incidents—the first whale deaths reported by a Norwegian krill ship—Aker BioMarine reinforced a rope barrier to repel large mammals. However, despite this modification, a fourth whale entanglement occurred on the same vessel the next season.In addition, every year, across the industry, dozens of seabirds collide with the trawlers' metal cables, sometimes suffering deadly injuries.The Norwegian Aker BioMarine's Antarctic Provider unloads large sacks of krill, now labelled ""product of Norway"" at a port in Montevideo, Uruguay, on Feb.

""Some level of conflict is inevitable.""Friedlaender was among 17 authors of a recent study concluding that competition for krill and shrinking sea ice are threats to the reproductive rates of humpback whales. Thepeer-reviewed research, based on a measure of hormones in the blubber of female whales, found that pregnancies rise and fall sharply based on krill availability.The burning of dirty fossil fuels to fish in such remote waters also carries a heavy carbon footprint. Producing a single metric ton of krill emits an average 3,800 kilograms (8,400 pounds) of carbon dioxide, according to the Virginia-basedGlobal Feed LCA Institute, an industry-led initiative that tracks the environmental costs of hundreds of feed ingredients. That's more than six times the pollution associated with fishing for Peruvian anchovy, a popular ingredient for fish feed.This combination of March 2023 photos shows ships involved in krill fishing in the Southern Ocean off Antarctica, top row from left, the Antarctic Endeavour, the Shen Lan and the Sejong; middle row from left, the Long Fa, the Antarctic Endurance and the Antarctic Sea; bottom row from left, the More Sodruzhestva and the Frio Las Palmas. Credit: AP Photo/David KeytonJohansen downplayed such comparisons, saying Aker BioMarine's own carbon footprint is much lower than the industry average and falling fast thanks to innovations in its engines. By 2050 it aims to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels altogether and power its fleet with hydrogen-based fuels currently in development.""We are going to be one of those first companies that use that,"" he pledged.SUSTAINABILITYWith an approaching storm threatening hurricane-force winds, the Allankay abandons the krill fleet and finds shelter in a quiet cove protected by the craggy rim of a still active underwater volcano.A stone's throw from a few lounging sea lions, rusting storage tanks, boilers and beached harpoon boats lay testament to Deception Island's past as a Norwegian whaling station.

Severe thunderstorms, rain, and snow are expected to hit several parts of the U.S., including Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and New York, as the storm moves from the Mississippi Valley up the northeast early in the week. Delays in air travel are likely to occur across the East Coast earlier in the week—including New York City, Washington D.C., and Philadelphia, while delays on major highways are also expected. “The system is currently over the South Central U.S. and will be progressing towards the east coast by Wednesday,” says Cody Snell, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center for the National Weather Service (NWS). Severe storms could affect flights in parts of the South and East Coast starting today. Be sure to check your flight status with your airline and monitorhttps://t.co/smgdqJN3td. Find helpful air travel tips athttps://t.co/HzQWUCBzvV.#FAAWeatherSquad#Thanksgiving2023https://t.co/vKhSvfDc64 On Monday night, the lower Mississippi Valley, particularly Louisiana and Mississippi, face the biggest threats, with expected high wind gusts, hail, and the potential for tornadoes, says Snell. The storm is then expected to move to the mid-Atlantic and East Coast on Tuesday, drenching the region—including New York City and Boston— with rain. Severe storms are also set to hit the southeast and Southern Appalachians on Tuesday and produce a mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain in parts of the Appalachians and the Northeast. Early in the week, New York City’s emergency management system released atravel advisoryfor Tuesday and Wednesday, as the city expects to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain and 30 to 40 mile per hour wind gusts. Parts of Vermont have beenplacedunder winter weather advisories as the region prepares for a mix of rain and snow on Tuesday afternoon and into Wednesday. A winter weather advisory has also been put in effect in areas ofMaine, where 4 to 6 inches of snow are expected. The good news is that the rough weather is not set to linger in any one place for too long. “The system is going to be progressive,” says Snell. “It's going to move through each region by day.” As some of thebusiest travel daysof the year, traveling on the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving can often come with unique delays and challenges— and the anticipated storm will only add to difficulties. Accuweatherpredictssignificant weather-related delays on highways such as Interstates 40, 44, 55, 64, 70, 75 and 80 as well as on the mid-Atlantic I-80, I-81 and I-95. Snell notes that, though the weather will cause some headaches, it will likely still be safe to travel in most regions. Snell advises travelers to have alerts set up for any weather advisories and include potential weather-related delays into their travel plans. ​​""If you're expecting bad weather, you want to give yourself some more time so you're not in a rush.” Aside from some snow hitting parts of Colorado on Black Friday, the difficult weather is expected to subside by Thanksgiving, making the holiday itself—and the journey home—a little less stressful. “The majority of the country clears out, and it [should be] pretty tranquil,” says Snell."

The storm -- which dumped rain and snow in the West this weekend -- is now marching east, bringing damaging winds and potential hail and tornadoes to the South. Jackson, Mississippi; Rolling Fork, Mississippi; and Alexandria, Louisiana, are most likely to get hit by the severe weather Monday afternoon and evening. A few tornadoes are likely, along with hail up to 2 inches in diameter and gusts up to 70 mph. A tornado watch was issued for parts of Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas through Monday evening. New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama, will be in the bull's-eye overnight. On Tuesday morning, rain will span from the South to the Midwest, impacting Atlanta; Birmingham, Alabama; Nashville, Tennessee; Cincinnati; Indianapolis and Chicago. On Tuesday afternoon and evening, the rain is forecast to spread into Charlotte, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; Cleveland; Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. The worst of the rain for the Northeast will be overnight Tuesday into Wednesday. Flash flooding is possible along the Interstate 95 corridor, so those driving to reach their Thanksgiving destinations should exercise extreme caution. The worst of the rain will clear out Wednesday morning, though some lingering showers are possible Wednesday afternoon in New England. Snow will begin in northern New England Tuesday afternoon and continue through Wednesday night. Six to 12 inches of snow is forecast for parts of Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Behind this cross-country storm will be the first bitter cold of the season. Temperatures on Thanksgiving morning will feel like the 20s and 30s for the majority of the U.S. The Federal Aviation Administration forecasts Wednesday to be the peak day for flights, with more than 49,000 commercial and general aviation planes in the skies. FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker said his agency will be ""working around the clock to make sure passengers get to their destination safely."" Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said Monday, ""While we can't control the weather, we will be using every tool at our disposal to keep cancellations [and] delays as low as possible in the first place -- including working collaboratively with the airlines."" American Airlines said in a statement Monday evening that its regional carriers have flown nearly 29,000 flights between Thursday and Sunday and only had two cancellations during that period.

This week is expected to bethe busiest in yearson the roads and airports could set new records – meaningthis week’s headache-inducing weathercould not come at a worse time. The havoc-wreaking system will track from the southern Plains into the Mississippi Valley on Monday and spread rain across much of the central US. Fortunately for any early week travelers, this rain is not expected to be heavy in most areas. 20 million from Texas to the Southeast at risk of severe storms and tornadoes But a different threat has emerged and could snarl travel for portions of the Gulf Coast late Monday afternoon as the storm moves east:severe thunderstorms, including possible tornadoes. Severe weather, while more common in the spring, can happen any time of the year if there’s enough warmth and moisture in the air. Damaging thunderstorms fired up Monday afternoon in east Texas, where the atmosphere is primed with plenty of moisture and warmth. These storms will track across Louisiana, Arkansas and push into Mississippi from Monday evening into early Tuesday morning. Damaging winds and hail are likely within any of Monday’s severe thunderstorms. Several tornadoes are also possible, especially across Louisiana and Mississippi. A fresh input of atmospheric energy and a robust surge of moisture will charge up the storm’s impacts Tuesday and usher in the most widespread, impactful weather of the week. The issues will start early Tuesday morning in the Southeast, where the severe thunderstorm threat will be highest in southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. Storms could unload damaging wind gusts and perhaps a tornado. Rain will expand east throughout Tuesday and spread into parts of the mid-Atlantic and the Southeast, where it will fall heavily at times. This heavy rainfall is unlikely to result in widespread flooding, but may pond on some roadways or in low-lying areas. Breezy conditions will develop across the East on Tuesday, especially in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. The combination of gusty winds and drenching rain may lead to disruptions in airport operations for large hubs in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, DC. Wintry weather will present another challenge for holiday travelers in parts of the Northeast on Tuesday. Rain will mix with sleet and snow when precipitation begins across the elevated terrain of Pennsylvania Tuesday morning and southern New York by Tuesday afternoon. This wintry mix will expand into parts of Vermont and New Hampshire Tuesday evening and turn mostly to snow in some areas Tuesday night. Accumulating snow Tuesday night will largely be confined to the highest elevations of the Adirondacks and the Green and White mountains. Weather travel disruptions may not be as widespread on Wednesday as the stormslowly tracks off the East Coast and inland impacts start to diminish. Roadways may be slick or snow-covered in parts of New York, Vermont and New Hampshire Wednesday morning following Tuesday night’s wintry weather. More accumulating snow will arrive in Maine on Wednesday as a wintry mix continues across Vermont and New Hampshire. Rain will taper off throughout the day across Pennsylvania, New Jersey and much of New York, but will persist across the Carolinas and parts of the Southeast. For travelers across the West, the weather will be perfect for travel on Tuesday and Wednesday with high pressure in control across almost the entire region. Thanksgiving will be much cooler and largely dry across the central and eastern US as chilly Canadian air settles into place in the wake of the storm. However, this influx of cold air will cause lake-effect snow showers to develop downwind of the Great Lakes. Gas prices are tumbling, just in time for Thanksgiving Dry weather is expected for the annual Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City on Thursday morning, but some breezy conditions may persist. The parade’s famous balloons are typically flown closer to the ground on a breezy day and higher off the ground on a calm day. Elsewhere, a few rain showers may push across coastal Texas while in the West some mountain snow could bring fresh powder to high elevations in the northern Rockies. Weather conditions will generally be calmer for travelers across the eastern half of the US heading home after Thanksgiving festivities on Friday, but the weekend may not be dry. Another storm may develop and move off the East Coast over the weekend. Rain and potential wintry weather is possible across the mid-Atlantic and Northeast.It’s still too early to know exactly how, or even if, this storm develops, but details will come into focus by midweek. Travelers in the West should be treated another stretch of favorable conditions as high pressure remains in place."

Now leaders from beyond the traditional U.S.-Europe-China power center—some new to the international stage, others already veterans—are emerging. And women are at the forefront.""Women are now thedecision makersthat can increase the likelihood of impactful decisions that actually stick,"" says Jennifer Morgan, Germany's specialclimateenvoy. After all, she says, it was two women—Laurence Tubiana, France's climate envoy, and Christiana Figueres, who ran the United Nations' climate body—who helped broker the landmark Paris Agreement in 2015 to slow global warming.With the world dangerously off track from the target of keeping temperature rise within 1.5°C of pre-industrial times, a global plan to tackle climate change is needed more than ever. We take a look at some of the people who will be leading those efforts in the years to come.Mia MottleyFew have changed the rules of the climate capital game more than Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley. Through powerful speeches and radical proposals, she's led a push to rewire the global financial system to make it easier forpoor countriesto have access to funds.Mottley, 58, wants to overhaul the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank so less creditworthy countries can borrow more money to invest in protections against deadly weather events and be eligible for temporary debt relief when a disaster hits.More than 40 world leaders met in Paris earlier this year to discuss her plan, known as the Bridgetown Agenda. The summit closed with support for more nimble IMF emergency funding, early warning systems for disasters, catastrophe insurance and pauses on debt repayments.""She is an incredible speaker,"" says Sebastien Treyer, executive director of French think tank Institut du Développement Durable et des Relations Internationales. ""I have heard her speak many times, but every time I am emotionally taken again.""Island nations play an outsized role in climate talks because their very existence threatened by rising seas and more frequent and forceful cyclones. But it is Mottley who has taken center stage in pitching the solutions for developing countries, while allying herself to the likes of French President Emmanuel Macron to win support.Her Bridgetown Initiative—a blueprint to overhaul the global financial system to help heavily-indebted climate-vulnerable countries—was forged in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017. After watching the category 5 storm ravage the neighboring island of Dominica, Mottley and her college buddy Avinash Persaud, a development economist, set about drawing up a plan to mitigate the impacts of future storms fueled by global warming.Mottley wants to overhaul the so-called Bretton Woods institutions, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank (as well as their multilateral development bank successors), so that they lend more money to less credit-worthy countries. Those loans would help fund sea defenses and provide temporarily debt relief when a disaster hits. Mottley and Persaud have also suggested a climate levy on shipping or financial transactions could help.The proposals are radical, but they're starting to gain traction among developed countries that have long been resistant to paying out more. More than 40 world leaders met in Paris earlier this year to work out how the Bridgetown Agenda might become reality. The summit closed with a movement toward more nimble emergency funding from the IMF, early-warning systems for disasters, catastrophe insurance triggered automatically by extreme conditions and pauses on debt repayments.Jennifer MorganA longtime climate activist, Jennifer Morgan has attended every COP summit and spent almost three decades helping lead nonprofits such as Greenpeace and the World Resources Institute. But last year the 57-year-old moved into the political arena herself, reporting directly to Germany's foreign minister as the country's climate representative. Morgan, a New Jersey native who's lived in Germany since 2003, was a surprising pick for a country that rarely appoints foreigners to its top ranks.She says her past as a heavy-hitter activist hasn't hindered her. ""When you're an NGO, your job is to be out there, pushing hard and provoking,"" she says. ""I don't feel that I am constrained in speaking truth to power, but I have to do it in a different manner. Words matter even more.""Morgan was instrumental in the setting up of a new fund to pay for climate damages at last year's COP in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Yet she was left visibly angry at the end of the meeting over the lack of progress on curbing emissions.It's imperative that more is done this year, she says, both on slashing carbon pollution and getting countries like China and Saudi Arabia to pay for the impacts caused in part by their emissions. She points out that China is now the world's second largest economy and Saudi Arabia one of the biggest oil producers. ""We don't live in 1992 anymore,"" she says.Morgan's profile is set to rise at this year's COP28 meeting in Dubai now that Frans Timmermans has stepped down as the European Union's climate chief. ""We need a transformational roadmap,"" she says. ""We need to understand the moment we're in right now for the future of humanity—that's what motivates me.""'Eve BazaibaWithout the Congo Basin to act as a vast carbon sink, humanity will lose the fight against global warming. Ève Bazaiba, 58, wants to make sure rich countries know that—and pay to defend it.In two and a half years on the job, the Democratic Republic of Congo's minister of environment has become a fiery voice in climate talks on behalf of emerging economies fighting for compensation to protect their environment.At the top of Bazaiba's list of demands are higher payouts for carbon credits bought by companies and countries seeking to offset their pollution. And she has some bargaining power: Congo is home to the world's second-biggest rainforest and the largest tropical peatlands.Positioning herself as a pragmatist, Bazaiba promotes Congo as a ""solution country"" in the fight against climate change with its forests. The nation has the world's largest hydropower potential and vast reserves of minerals such as copper and cobalt that are needed to roll out green technologies. Bazaiba also supports opening up parts of the rainforest to oil drilling, saying the government can still protect the environment, a position that's made her controversial among environmentalists.But she's been consistent in her view that no global approach to slowing Earth's warming can succeed without Congo. ""There's not a single room in the world—north, south, east, west—that can speak about climate questions without the Democratic Republic of Congo,"" she said on a recent radio interview.Barbara CreecyBazaiba's South African counterpart Barbara Creecy has also proven herself to be a deft negotiator when it comes to climate finance. In 2021, she helped broker a groundbreaking deal with developed nations including the US and UK to transition her country away from coal.Since taking the post in May 2019, the 65-year-old has been a vocal advocate for thedeveloping world. There's an ""injustice that lies right at the heart of the climate crisis, which is the fact that the African continent is responsible for less than 2% of historical emissions,"" Creecy says. ""But this is a continent that's gravely affected by climate change.""The former anti-apartheid activist, a dark horse candidate to become her country's finance minister, has argued forcefully for more financial support to help developing nations adapt to a warmer planet and cut emissions. At the same time, she's urged other emerging economies to focus on solutions rather than grievances over broken promises.""Let's stop harping on and on about the $100 billion"" a year that rich countries promised to deliver by 2020, she says. ""Let's actually talk about the post 2024 environment. What are the new goals? Where are we going to find new public finance?""Marina SilvaNow in her second stint as Brazil's environment and climate change minister, 65-year-old Marina Silva has spent a lifetime devoted to nature. The daughter of rubber tappers—hailing from one of the country's most remote and impoverished states, nestled deep in the Amazon—she brings lived experience of the impacts of deforestation on communities that depend on the rainforest.As part of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's left-wing government, she's busy repairing the country's green credentials following the ouster of Jair Bolsonaro, one of the world's most unapologetic anti-environmentalists. Silva describes restoring protections for the rainforest as a ""postwar recovery."" Since Lula took office in January, there's been a 49.7% reduction in deforestation in the Amazon.""There are things that we have to let go of, such as the idea that Brazil is an agricultural power because it covers a large area,"" Silva says. ""This idea has to be abandoned.""With Brazil set to lead the Group of 20 next year and host the COP30 summit in 2025, Silva has the opportunity in Dubai to stake out the nation's positions onclimate changebefore it takes the spotlight on the international stage.Silva's background gives her a unique voice, says Rachel Cleetus, senior economist and policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""She comes from a perspective of not just understanding the issues at play, but also understanding the role of the people, especially the Indigenous people.""Others to WatchTina Stege: The 47-year-old climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, one of the most vulnerable nations toglobal warming, is an instrumental voice in the campaign to phase out fossil fuels.Maisa Rojas: A geophysics professor and contributor to major UN climate reports, Rojas, 51, brings a wealth of scientific expertise to her job as Chile's environment minister.Wopke Hoekstra: The EU's new climate chief, who's 48, is a relatively unknown quantity in environmental circles, but he comes with a reputation for fiscal prudence from his tenure as Dutch finance minister.Teresa Ribera: The charismatic environment minister for Spain, 54, is at the forefront of EU green policymaking, with her country holding the rotating presidency this year.Kristin Tilley: Australia's climate ambassador, 48, is trying to give her country a greener image and pushing for it to host COP31.Steven Guilbeault: Canada's 53-year-old climate minister, another Greenpeace alum, will be in focus at COP28 after wildfires ravaged much of his country this year.2023 Bloomberg News.

Clorox’s 2023 investor meeting exemplifies and re-affirms why corporate cyber governance too often remains primarily a rhetorical charade. Just a few months after a devastating summertime cyberattack that upended production, dented revenues by nearly $500 million and cut valuation over $3 billion, Clorox opted to further entrench, empower and enrich its board and c-suite. The consumer products giant rewarded CEO Linda Randle with the self-supervising, dual title of board chair. Matthew Shattock, the chair during the recent crisis, was retained and simply re-designated as the board’s lead independent director. The other ten directors ran unopposed and were summarily re-appointed. Intriguingly, during its proxy meeting week, the company also internally circulated a vague memo announcing chief information security officer Amy Bogac’s departure. Those simultaneous, well-orchestrated moves illustrate the whispered reality of many corporate boardrooms. If and when breaches occur, blame hostile external actors, fund remediation and pin responsibility on IT staff. That tacit approach places CISOs in an unwinnable position — keep your well-paying, high-stress job by acquiescing to board cyber apathy and bear the career downside when severe incidents occur. Show Don’t Tell Proxy statements, a grossly underutilized information well, can quickly reveal (or conceal) much about strategy, corporate governance and incentives. For instance, despite Clorox’s massive cyber crisis, its 2023 proxy is filled with several concerning, lax “business as usual” governance red flags, including: Storm Riders The chasm between boards and cybersecurity leaders is a profound problem. A recent survey of 600 board members published in the Harvard Business Review by Lucia Milică and Keri Pearlson found “despite investments of time and money, most directors (65%) still believe their organizations are at risk of a material cyberattack within the next 12 months, and almost half believe they are unprepared to cope with a targeted attack.” Further, the study revealed that “just 69% of responding board members see eye-to-eye with their CISOs. Fewer than half (47%) of members serve on boards that interact with their CISOs regularly, and almost a third of them only see their CISOs at board presentations.” In turn, it's not surprising that, despite widespread corporate posturing and espoused cyber risk concern, “weather the storm” remains a common governance crisis response. Serious boards forge real accountability plans through tough conversations, independent assessments and meaningful agreement well before setbacks occur. A close look shows that Clorox’s proxy day scripts the organizational oligarchs’ crisis survival playbook. Do and spend just enough to avoid compliance, regulatory and legal headaches, persevere through bad press and escape with little or no consequence to personal prestige, professional identity and hefty income streams. Was Clorox cyber chief Bogac’s departure exasperated resignation or board abandonment? We may never know, as airtight employee separation agreements are rarely made public. And who’s really reading proxy statements anyway?"

The president of the Dominican Republic has insisted that climate change must be taken seriously after heavy rains killed at least 21 people and displaced thousands more. More than 13,000 people have had to move to more secure areas after torrential rains over the previous 48 hours flooded homes, caused power outages and damaged bridges and roads, the Caribbean country’s Emergency Operations Center (COE) said on Sunday. At least 21 people have lost their lives, the COE added. The storm’s victims include nine people who died on Saturday after rains caused the wall of a highway tunnel to collapse onto their cars in the capital, Santa Domingo, according to the national police. The water “infiltrated a saturated subsoil” and the foundation of the concrete wall gave way, the Ministry of Public Works said on the following day. An investigation into the incident has been ordered, while the majority of the nation’s 32 provinces remain under an alert designation. Videos on social media showed rushing water dragging cars down streets and flooded buildings. President Luis Abinader said it is the “largest rainfall event ever” in the Dominican Republic’s history. “Those who do not believe in climate change, start believing,” said Abinader, who spoke of “extensive and substantial” damages. Classes have been suspended until Wednesday, Abinader said, “in order to evaluate the schools that may have been affected” and “guarantee the safety of our young people”. The rains, from a tropical depression, are expected to continue across portions of the country for the next 24 hours, the United States embassy said in a weather alert. More than 2,500 people had to be rescued by protection agencies, and some 2,600 homes had been affected by the storm, the COE said. Forty-five communities were without communication as of Sunday afternoon, according to the COE report. At the end of August, the passage of Tropical Storm Franklin through the Dominican Republic killed two people, left one missing, and forced the evacuation of some 3,000 people from areas in dangerous conditions.

The government of the Caribbean country has come under scrutiny, with experts saying they had warned more than 20 years ago about the wall’s failures and lack of effort to fix them. “It has weaknesses in the design,” civil engineer Cristian Rojas told The Associated Press. “No anchors were placed, and that is why the wall collapsed.” Rojas, former president of the Dominican College of Engineers, Architects and Surveyors, said the force of the water in a flooded adjacent avenue, combined with the type of wall that was built, led to the collapse. Dominican geologist Osiris de Léon recalled that the first warnings about the wall were made more than two decades ago. He posted a story from December 1999 on X, formerly known as Twitter, in which El Siglo newspaper quoted the college recommending that the wall be rebuilt because it was cracked and “it can fall and cause a tragic accident.” The collapse occurred Saturday in Santo Domingo when a portion of the wall that runs along the heavily transited 27 of February Avenue fell in one piece, crushing cars and their occupants, authorities said. Among the victims wasPuerto Ricoprosecutor Michael Orozco, his wife, María Nereida Martínez, and his in-laws, according to Javier Rivera, president of the island’s Association of Prosecutors. Martínez was pregnant. “Comrade Orozco was living a wonderful personal moment with his family, and as a young, committed lawyer, a promising future awaited him,” Rivera said. Also killed was Dominican Police Gen. Eduardo Cabrera Castillo, authorities said. Andrés Matos, spokesman for the Ministry of Public Works, rejected accusations that the government did not properly maintain the wall and nearby infrastructure. “These tunnels and overpasses are given permanent maintenance,” Matos told the AP. He attributed the collapse to other causes but declined to provide details. “The ministry is ordering a deep, structuralist investigation, which implies that we should not get ahead of the causes,” he said. The collapse occurred as a tropical disturbance moved through the western Caribbean, battering the Dominican Republic with heavy rains over the weekend. Authorities said at least 24 people died, including those crushed by the wall. The storm tore tin roofs off hundreds of homes and cut off access to nearly a dozen communities, authorities said. Officials in neighboring Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, said four people died and another two are missing. Dozens of people remained in shelters after the storm flooded hundreds of homes and cut off several communities, they said. ___ Associated Press reporter Dánica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed."

Turkey has launched a rescue mission to hunt for 11 missing sailors after deadly storms sank a cargo vessel, killing one. The ship sank in the Black Sea amid a burst of stormy weather, killing at least one sailor and leaving the remaining 11 crew members missing, Turkey’s interior minister said on Monday. The weather front that wrecked the vessel killed at least nine people, including the sailor, over the weekend in Turkey. The Kafkametler cargo ship went down with 12 crew members on board after hitting a seawall 120km (75 miles) east of Istanbul, Turkey’s Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said. Turkish rescuers, initially held back by the poor weather, on Monday scanned the waters by helicopter in search of the missing sailors. They have recovered the body of one sailor and are continuing to scour the area for those still lost, Yerlikaya said. The Turkish-flagged ship was transporting ferrosilicon – an alloy used in steelmaking – from the Russian port of Temryuk to Aliaga in Turkey. The storms that broke out in northwestern Turkey caused havoc over the weekend, destroying another cargo ship, forcing the evacuation of a prison, and killing at least nine people. A Cameroon-flagged vessel split into two due to the treacherous conditions after weathering 5-metre (16-foot) waves near the coastal city of Eregli, the Maritime General Directorate said. All 13 crew members were rescued. At Eregli’s prison, rising water levels pushed authorities to transfer inmates to surrounding facilities, Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said. Storms and flooding meanwhile killed at least four people in the southeastern province of Batman, three people in the northern province of Zonguldak and another person in southeastern Diyarbakir, Yerlikaya said. The turbulent weather followed an especially dry summer that brought Istanbul’s dams to their lowest levels in nine years. Much of Turkey has been suffering from an extended drought that scientists attribute to climate change and poor water management. Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Months of … [+2402 chars]",Climate,"The global average temperature on Friday was more than two degrees Celsius hotter than pre-industrial levels for the first time on record, Europe's Copernicus climate monitor said Monday. Months of extraordinary heat is expected to make 2023 the hottest year in history, with droughts, massive wildfires and fierce storms ravaging swathes of the planet. According to provisional data, global temperatures on November 17 were 2.06C above the pre-industrial average, Samantha Burgess, Deputy Head of the EU's Climate Change Service (C3S) said on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""This was the first day when global temperature was more than 2C above 1850-1900 levels,"" she added. The 2015 Paris Agreement enshrined the goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels and to aim for a safer 1.5C. One day above 2C does not mean that the Paris threshold has been breached -- the deal instead refers to change measured over decades. Climate experts have since urged the world to aim for the lower limit to avoid major climate impacts, such as heatwaves, super hurricanes and melting ice caps. They defined warming as ""the increase in the 30-year global average"" relative to the average from 1850 to 1900. The current climate is considered to have warmed by nearly 1.2C compared to that reference period. The first day to exceed the 2C target is part of a series of records this year: October was the warmest ever recorded globally, as was every month since June, according to Copernicus, which said that 2023 would with ""near certainty"" surpass the hottest year on record set in 2016. Beyond these official records, scientists say proxy data for the climate going back further -- like tree rings or ice cores -- suggests the temperatures seen this year could be unprecedented in human history, potentially the warmest in more than 100,000 years. October was 1.7C warmer than an estimate of that month's average for the pre-industrial era, Copernicus said earlier this month. And global average temperatures since January have been the highest in records going back to 1940, the monitor added, registering 1.43C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average. Leaders meeting November 30 to December 12 in the United Arab Emirates for the COP28 conference will have to respond to a damning progress report on the world's Paris pledges after major scientific studies have made clear the world is far off track. The conference is expected to draw up the first official assessment of the Paris Agreement and, if possible, corrective measures."

Insurers can encourage eco-friendly building practices, energy-efficient upgrades, and sustainable materials by offering coverage incentives. These factors align with the growing focus on environmental sustainability and eco-conscious homeowners. Additionally, blockchain technology can enhance transparency, reduce fraud, and streamline the management of insurance policies, particularly in property transactions and ownership transfers. As more individuals run businesses from their homes, insurers can offer specialized coverage tailored to the unique risks faced by home-based businesses, including protection against cyber threats, liability, and business interruption. Furthermore, pay-as-you-go insurance allows homeowners to pay premiums based on usage and risk factors. It can encourage safer behaviour and cost savings for responsible homeowners. Besides, the parametric insurance approach involves pre-defined triggers that automatically pay when specific conditions are met, such as wind speeds during a hurricane. It can provide faster, more transparent claims processing for natural disasters. Request to Download Sample Research Report -https://www.thebrainyinsights.com/enquiry/sample-request/13798 Report Coverage Details Key Insight of the global Home Insurance market Asia Pacific is expected to witness the highest market growth over the forecast period. The Asia Pacific region has experienced significant economic growth over the past few decades, leading to a growing middle class with rising disposable incomes. As people achieve a higher standard of living and homeownership becomes more attainable, the demand for home insurance has steadily increased. Additionally, the Asia Pacific region is the most populous in the world, and with a growing population, there is an increased need for housing and insurance. This demographic shift drives the demand for home insurance. The Asia Pacific region is also susceptible to various natural disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons, and flooding. These risks make homeowners keenly aware of the need for insurance coverage to protect their homes and possessions. As the cost of home insurance becomes more affordable and accessible, many households in the Asia Pacific region prefer to purchase policies, further boosting the market's growth. Besides, some regional governments are promoting homeownership and risk mitigation through initiatives that offer incentives for purchasing home insurance, especially in areas prone to natural disasters. In 2022, the dwelling coverage segment dominated the market with the largest share of 38.61% and revenue of 100.29 billion. The coverage segment includes content coverage, comprehensive coverage, dwelling coverage and other optional coverages. In 2022, the landlords segment dominated the market with the highest share of 68.72% and market revenue of 178.50 billion. The end user form segment is classified into landlords and tenants. Advancement in market In February 2023: Allianz's Direct Home and Landlord insurance offerings have been extended to encompass additional regions in northern Queensland and Western Australia. This expansion comes from the company's decision to participate in the cyclone reinsurance pool, which is backed by the Federal Government, effective from January 1, 2023. With this expansion, many policyholders residing in high-cyclone risk areas in Northern Australia will experience the advantage of reduced premiums for their home and contents insurance. Procure Complete Research Report -https://www.thebrainyinsights.com/report/home-insurance-market-13798 Market Dynamics Driver: Legislative and regulatory changes. Changes in government regulations, particularly those related to building codes and insurance requirements, can have a significant impact on the home insurance market. These regulations are often introduced or modified in response to evolving risks, safety considerations, and the need to protect homeowners and insurers. One common example is the effect of stricter regulations in flood-prone areas. Government authorities regularly update building codes and construction standards to enhance the resilience of homes against natural disasters and other risks. Stricter building codes may require homes in certain areas to be built to withstand hurricanes, earthquakes, or other local hazards. In addition, stricter building codes can lead to safer and more resilient homes, which may result in fewer claims for insurers. This factor can positively impact the pricing and availability of home insurance in compliance with the new codes. Furthermore, government regulations that reinforce mortgage insurance requirements are critical in driving demand for home insurance. These requirements make it a standard practice for homeowners to purchase and maintain insurance coverage. Restraint: Lack of consumer awareness. Homeowners may need to appreciate the potential risks their homes face fully. This lack of awareness can lead to underestimating the importance of home insurance. They might assume that disasters or accidents are unlikely to affect them personally. In addition, some homeowners may need more financial literacy or a clear understanding of insurance. They need to grasp the financial impact of unexpected events, which can result in inadequate coverage or opting for the minimum required coverage. In regions with a history of stability and low incidence of disasters, homeowners may become complacent and assume they are immune to risks. This complacency can lead to paying attention to the need for comprehensive insurance coverage. Some homeowners may mistakenly believe that government assistance will fully cover losses in the event of a disaster. While government aid is available in certain cases, it is often limited and may only cover some expenses. Furthermore, home insurance policies can be complex, with different components for dwelling coverage, personal property, liability, and additional living expenses. Homeowners may need to understand what each component covers fully and pay more attention to their need for specific types of coverage. This lack of awareness can present challenges and hamper the growth of the home insurance market. Opportunity: Data analytics and risk assessment. Advanced data analytics enables insurers to collect, analyze, and interpret vast amounts of data from various sources. This data encompasses historical loss data, environmental factors, property attributes, claims history, and others. Insurers can use this information to gain a thorough understanding of the threats associated with insuring a particular property or area. In addition, with advanced data analytics, underwriters can make informed decisions by leveraging real-time and historical data to assess risk factors comprehensively. This factor leads to more efficient underwriting processes and allows underwriters to tailor coverage and pricing to meet specific risk profiles. Furthermore, geographic information systems (GIS) and geospatial data are integral to risk assessment. Advanced analytics can harness geospatial information to identify high-risk areas for perils such as flooding, wildfires, or crime. This factor enables insurers to offer coverage tailored to specific locations and risk levels. Challenge: Claims processing efficiency. Timely and efficient claims processing is vital for customer satisfaction. When policyholders experience a loss, they rely on their insurance provider to assist them promptly. Delays or cumbersome procedures can lead to frustration, erode trust, and tarnish the insurer's reputation. Efficient claims processing fosters trust and loyalty among policyholders. When insurers promptly and fairly settle claims, it reinforces the perception that policyholders are in good hands. This factor, in turn, encourages long-term relationships and customer retention. Additionally, an insurer's reputation is closely tied to its claims-handling capabilities. Negative experiences with claims can quickly spread through word-of-mouth, social media, and online reviews, potentially harming the company's image. Efficient claims processing helps protect and enhance the insurer's reputation. Furthermore, streamlining claims processing can be a significant competitive advantage. Insurers who excel in this area are more likely to draw the attention of new customers and retain existing ones. Customers often prioritize ease and speed of claims resolution when choosing an insurance provider. Interested to Procure the Research Report?

The tunnel of ancient beech trees outside Armoy, County Antrim, shot to international fame when it appeared in the US TV drama Game of Thrones. Originally there were about 150 trees but due to age and damage from several storms, only 86 are still standing. The felling plan follows a specialist survey which identified at-risk trees. The survey was commissioned by Stormont's Department for Infrastructure which stressed that the decision to fell the six trees ""has not been made lightly"". In a statement, a spokesperson for the department said that ""whilst the amenity value afforded by the corridor of trees is acknowledged, the safety of road users is paramount"". The Dark Hedges became a popular tourist attraction after the site was used to represent the Kingsroad in Game of Thrones. The trees appeared on screen in the first episode of the second season of HBO's epic fantasy series, albeit very briefly. Fans of the series flocked to the site to take photos of the tree-lined avenue, often as part of a tour of 25 Game of Thrones set locations around Northern Ireland. Visitors came in such numbers that a traffic ban was introduced in 2017. The Dark Hedges stand on privately-owned land but they overhang a public road outside the village. Safety concerns were raised with the Department for Infrastructure which is responsible for roads. The department said the independent survey ""found that 11 trees, out of a total of 86, along this route are in a poor condition and could pose a potential risk to the public"". It spoke to the landowners and stakeholders but said that ""given the urgency of the work required"" it had made arrangements to remove six of the 11 damaged trees this week. The department added it will ""continue to engage with landowners and other stakeholders regarding their implementation of a suitable management strategy to protect the future of the other 75 trees"". The Dark Hedges were planted in the 18th Century by the Stuart family who lived in the nearby Georgian mansion, Gracehill House. Gracehill House was named after James Stuart's wife, Grace Lynd. The Dark Hedges were intended to provide an impressive tree-lined entrance to their Gracehill estate. It is believed that most of the beech trees date from about 1775, but some could be even older. Game of Thrones crews filmed at the site in 2011, broadcasting the first and only scene featuring the Dark Hedges in 2012. By 2017, the road had become such a popular visitor attraction that traffic was banned from driving along Bregagh Road in order to protect the trees' roots. But no-one has been able to protect the Dark Hedges from the passage of time nor the ravages of Northern Ireland's winters. In recent years, several named storms have been responsible for taking down some of the more vulnerable trees. In 2016, Storm Gertrude ripped up two trees causing them collapse on to the road, and left a third tree badly damaged. In 2018, more trees fell when Storm Hector brought gales of up to 60mph to Northern Ireland. In 2021, another two trees were brought down by Storm Arwen."

Enthusiasts of the show eagerly visited the location to capture images of the tree-bordered pathway, frequently as a component of a tour featuring 25 Game of Thrones filming sites across Northern Ireland . The influx of visitors was so substantial that a traffic restriction was implemented in 2017. The Dark Hedges are located on privately owned land but extend over a public road adjacent to the village. According to the department for Infrastructure, an independent survey revealed that 11 trees, out of a total of 86 along this route, are in poor condition and could potentially endanger the public. Dark Hedges history Planted in the 18th Century by the Stuart family of Gracehill House, the Dark Hedges form a majestic tree-lined entrance to their estate. The beech trees, thought to mostly date back to around 1775, served as the backdrop for a notable scene in Game of Thrones, filmed in 2011 and aired in 2012. The mansion, Gracehill House, was named after James Stuart's wife, Grace Lynd. In 2017, Bregagh Road, known for its popularity among visitors, implemented a traffic ban to safeguard the tree roots. However, the Dark Hedges have faced the relentless impact of time and Northern Ireland's harsh winters. Recent storms, bearing distinct names, have contributed to the downfall of certain susceptible trees. FAQs: Why are six trees along the Dark Hedges in Northern Ireland being cut down? The trees are being removed because there is a risk of branches falling on tourists, including those visiting from Game of Thrones. What is the Dark Hedges site famous for? Dark Hedges is an iconic beech tree tunnel near Armoy, County Antrim. It gained global recognition through its feature in the US TV series Game of Thrones.

The Turkish-flagged Kafkametler sank on Sunday after hitting a breakwater outside the harbor off the town of Eregli, some 200 kilometers (124 miles) east of Istanbul, Yerlikaya told reporters. He said rescue crews were on standby waiting for the weather conditions to ease to begin a rescue mission. “Unfortunately, we could not carry out search-and-rescue activities for the 12 Turkish crew members,” Yerlikaya said. “As soon as conditions improve the search-and-rescue operations will begin immediately.” The severe storms that hit northwestern Turkey caused widespread damage and disruption on Sunday, including the breakup of another cargo ship and the evacuation of a prison. The Cameroon-flagged Pallada “broke into two due to heavy weather conditions” after running aground amid 5-meter (16-foot) waves off Eregli, the Maritime General Directorate said. All 13 crew were rescued safely. Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said prisoners had been transferred from Eregli’s prison to surrounding facilities due to rising water levels. Elsewhere in Turkey, two people were killed after being swept by flood waters caused by heavy rains in the southeastern provinces of Diyarbakir and Batman, Yerlikaya said. Some 50 people were hurt in the floods. In neighboring Bulgaria, gale-force winds and heavy rain and snow claimed the lives of two people on Sunday and disrupted power supplies. Officials declared a state of emergency in the Black Sea city of Varna. "

Raman lost more than Rs.20 lakh on Diwali night. A misdirected sky-shot cracker landed inside his eighth floor apartment and started a blaze that destroyed the furniture, gadgets and clothing. Fortunately, Raman and his family were out, so there were no casualties, but many valuables were reduced to ashes. Though it won’t lessen the emotional distress of losing one’s belongings and seeing one’s house covered in soot, a basic home insurance policy can cover the financial loss . Home insurance is as cheap as it is necessary. The annual premium of covering a house and its contents for Rs.20 lakh is only Rs.900-1,200 ( see graphic ). The cost is minuscule compared to the coverage it offers. Broken down to daily cost, it is less than half of what you pay for a cup of tea at a roadside vendor . GAURAV ARORA CHIEF, UNDERWRITING & CLAIMS, PROPERTY & CASUALTY, ICICI LOMBARD GENERAL INSURANCE “People invest their life savings in a house, but don’t do enough to protect this asset. A big chunk of the net worth is exposed to risk.” Yet, barely one in 20 homeowners purchases this cover. For an average person, his house is the biggest financial investment. “People invest their life savings in building a house, but don’t do enough to safeguard this investment,” says Gaurav Arora, Chief of Underwriting & Claims, Property & Casualty, ICICI Lombard General Insurance. “We have a very optimistic outlook and believe that disasters happen only to other people,” says Vivek Chaturvedi, CMO and Head of Direct Sales, Digit General Insurance. “The frequency of disasters may be low, but the severity of loss when the disaster strikes is very high,” he adds. You Might Also Like: What a home insurance policy will not cover Buyers nudged by nature Perhaps the most effective salesperson for home insurance is nature itself. Every time there is a natural disaster, home insurance sales pick up. In August 2018, floods wreaked havoc in Kerala. The following year, the fire and allied perils segment witnessed a 34% jump in premium income as homeowners rushed to cover their houses and valuables. In May 2020, cyclone Amphan hit West Bengal and premium income shot up 27% in 2020-21 (see graphic ). However, public memory is short, and once the memories of disaster recede, home insurance is relegated to the backseat again. “We saw a parallel in health insurance recently. When Covid struck and medical bills shot to stratospheric levels, there was a massive surge in the purchase of health insurance. Now that the threat has gone away, health insurance is back to normal levels,” says Chaturvedi of Digit General Insurance. GURDEEP SINGH BATRA HEAD OF PROPERTY UNDERWRITING, BAJAJ ALLIANZ GENERAL INSURANCE “Flat owners need not depend on home insurance taken by the housing society. They can buy an additional cover for their unit and its contents.” Devastating earthquakes, cyclones and floods are not the only risks that your house is exposed to. The mushrooming of high-rise buildings and growing use of gadgets and appliances have increased the risk of fires. According to one estimate, Mumbai witnesses more than 5,000 fire incidents every year, and 70% of these are caused by electricity. Both Delhi and Bengaluru record about 2,500 fire incidents in a year. “Fire incidents are on the rise because the use of electrical and electronic gadgets has increased the load on electrical wiring, especially in high-rise buildings,” says Arora of ICICI Lombard General Insurance. In many cases, the fire may not even start, but the interiors may still get damaged. Chaturvedi of points out that once a fire alarm gets activated, water pressure from the sprinkler system often damages the interiors. The electronic gadgets in the house will also get damaged due to water. Unless the contents are insured against damage, the owner will suffer a loss even if there is no fire. Some people have this misconception that if they live in a rented house, they don’t need home insurance. Any damage to the house will, of course, be the landlord’s headache, but what about the contents? You also need insurance against any damage to the contents (by natural or man-made disaster), and against burglary. Essential covers for your house If we have convinced you to buy home insurance, here are the things you need to consider. Buy a policy that fits your needs. Three years ago, the insurance regulator made it mandatory for general insurers to offer a standard home insurance policy. The Bharat Griha Raksha (BGR) policy offered by all insurers covers damage to the house by natural calamities, fire, explosion or even external forces, such as a tree falling or a vehicle crashing into the wall. It also covers many associated costs of damage, such as removal of debris and fees of the architect or consulting engineer. Though this policy offers comprehensive insurance, the standard BGR has its limitations. The policy covers contents up to Rs.10 lakh or 20% of the cover, whichever is lower. A cover of Rs.10 lakh may not sufficiently cover the contents of the average middle class home. “If you have highvalue items in your house, you should consider buying an additional cover for the contents,” says Gurdeep Singh Batra, Head of Property Underwriting, Risk Engg, Global Accounts and Coinsurance, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. The BGR offers an additional cover for valuable contents on an agreed value basis, where the value is determined by mutual agreement. “One can also buy breakdown cover for gadgets and appliances,” says Tarun Mathur, CBO, General Insurance & Co-founder, Policybazaar.com. Don’t undervalue While buying home insurance, make sure you have sufficient cover. Yes, you need to insure only the value of the structure, not the cost of the property, but make sure you have calculated the reconstruction cost correctly. “Home insurance buyers often make the mistake of linking the cover to the loan taken for the property,” says Batra of Bajaj Allianz general Insurance. The cost of reconstructing a basic quality structure is only Rs.1,200-1,500 per square foot. But if your house has premium fittings and a lot of branded stuff, the cost will be much higher at Rs.3,500-4,000 per square foot (see graphic). Buy adequate cover for your house. SRABASTI DHALI VICE-PRESIDENT & NATIONAL MANAGER, PCG & HOME, TATA AIG GENERAL INSURANCE “A multi-year plan saves one the trouble of annual renewals, locks future premiums and hikes the cover by 10% every year.” The other common mistake is that buyers don’t review coverage when the policy comes up for renewal. Inflation will push up the cost of construction every year, so you need to increase the cover accordingly. One way to do this is by taking a multi-year policy. Such policies increase the base cover by 10% every year to offset the impact of inflation. “A multi-year policy saves the buyer the trouble of renewing it every year, locks in the premium amount for the future, and even takes care of inflation by way of 10% annual increase in home building cover,” says Srabasti Dhali, Vice-President & National Manager, PCG & Home, TATA AIG General Insurance. Valuation of contents The valuation of contents is critical. Start by making an inventory of the items you want to cover, mentioning the item, the year of purchase, model and machine number, and its value. Keep in mind that insurance companies value appliances, gadgets and other items using the standard depreciation formula. The value of the item keeps reducing over the years. So an electronic item bought for Rs.50,000 two years ago will now be worth only Rs.20,000-22,000. It’s important to revisit this list every year when the policy comes up for renewal. You may have discarded some items in the list or added new ones. Make sure to notify the company for any additional item and furnish all the required details. If the overall value of the contents is within the insurance cover opted for, there won’t be any change in premium. This is why it is advisable to use the services of an insurance agent so that there is no discrepancy. If you want to insure some art or artefacts, you will need a valuation certificate from a certified agency. This requirement is waived if the item is worth less than Rs.1 lakh and the total value of such items does not exceed Rs.5 lakh. VIVEK CHATURVEDI CMO AND HEAD OF DIRECT SALES, DIGIT GENERAL INSURANCE “We tend to believe disasters happen only to other people. The frequency of disasters may be low, but the severity of loss is very high.” How much does it cost? The essential insurance that your house needs is very cheap. ESSEN TIAL COVERS Damage to building The basic home insurance that everybody needs. It covers the structure for damage by natural calamities, such as earthquake, lightning, storms and floods, and man-made perils, such as fire, vandalism and riots. The policy pays for repairs and reconstruction of the damaged property. Cost of cover: Rs.15-30 per Rs.1 lakh Damage to contents Apart from the building, you can also cover the contents against these perils. The premium is slightly higher for this coverage, though some companies charge the same rate for both the building and contents. Cost of cover: Rs.30-50 per Rs.1 lakh Burglary or theft The house contents also need to be insured against burglary or theft. The items to be covered (furniture, artefacts, clothing, appliances, gadgets) are specified and insured for an agreed value determined by the customer and insurance company. Cost of cover: Rs.125-200 per Rs.1 lakh GOOD TO HAVE COVERS Breakdown of gadgets Gadgets in the house can also be covered against breakdown. Here, again, the items have to be listed and insured for an agreed value determined by the customer and insurance company. Cost of cover : Rs.200-300 per Rs.1 lakh EMI protection If the houseowner had taken a loan for the damaged property, he can buy protection against EMI payments. The insurance company pays the EMIs for a specified period when the damaged house is being repaired or reconstructed. Cost of cover: Rs.2,500 for six months’ EMIs Alternative accommodation If the house is damaged, a tenant will have to take up alternative accommodation. If the rent for this is higher than that being paid by him for the damaged house, the insurance company will pay the difference for the period specified in the policy. Cost of cover: Rs.2,500 for six months’ rent Loss of rent If the damage to house makes it unlivable, the owner will suffer loss of rent. Houseowners can safeguard themselves against this loss with an add-on cover that pays rent for a chosen period. Cost of cover: Rs.2,000 for a rent of Rs.25,000 per month for six months AVOIDABLE COVERS Personal accident Houseowners can bundle in a personal accident cover with their home insurance policy. This cover is very cheap, though the insured amount is not very high. Cost of cover: Rs.300 for Rs.5 lakh Baggage loss Another add-on cover is for loss of baggage during travel. This cover may not be very useful. In any case, a travel policy taken by the individual will also offer baggage cover. Cost of cover: Rs.250 for baggage worth Rs.50,000 HOW TO BRING DOWN HOME INSURANCE COST Worried by the cost of home insurance? Here are ways to reduce the premium. AGREE TO PAY : If you agree to pay a minimum amount for the repair of your house and contents, the premium is reduced. However, not all companies offer this option. BE SELECTIVE: Don't insure all items in the house. Very old items, with low depreciated values, should be kept out of the list. ENHANCE COVERAGE: Some companies offer discounts if you take 2-3 add-on covers. This may not bring down the premium, but will enhance your coverage. INVEST IN SAFETY: If you install safety measures, such as fire safety alarms and fire-fighting equipment, you can get discounts ranging from 10-15%. CLAIM TAX BENEFITS: If you are a self-employed professional or businessman, you can claim deduction for the amount spent on home insurance. This benefit is not available to salaried people. BUY MULTI-YEAR PLAN: A multi-year plan will increase the cover by 10% every year. This will not bring down the cost per se, but will enhance your cover at no extra cost.

Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here. Moving is never easy — and it’s even harder in the era of global warming. Beyond the usual concerns like jobs, affordability, and proximity to family and friends, people are now considering rising seas, wildfire smoke, and heat waves. According to a recent survey, nearly a third of Americans named climate change as a motivation to move. Some are headed to “climate havens,” the places experts say will be relatively pleasant to live in as the world heats up, like Duluth, Minnesota; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and Burlington, Vermont. Researchers have pointed to the Great Lakes region, and Michigan in particular, as a destination for people seeking to escape the storm-ravaged Southeast or the parched Southwest. The Midwest holds special appeal with its abundant fresh water, cooler summers, and comparatively little risk from hurricanes and wildfires. But as the federal government’s comprehensive Fifth National Climate Assessment detailed last week, there’s nowhere you can truly hide from climate change. This summer, historic wildfires in Canada sent unhealthy smoke swirling into the Midwest and Northeast, bringing apocalyptic skies from Minneapolis to Buffalo, New York, and all the supposed refuges in between. Heavy rain in July caused devastating flash floods in Vermont. Three years earlier, a ProPublica analysis had identified the hardest-hit place in the state, Lamoille County, as the safest county in the U.S. “It’s time to put the idea of climate safe havens to rest,” the climate news site Heatmap declared this summer. Still, the new assessment demonstrates that some places are safer than others. The report says that moving away from more dangerous spots to less precarious ones is a solution that’s already happening — not only in coastal areas in the Southeast, but also in flood zones in the Midwest. The assessment also makes it clear that vulnerability is often created by city planning choices. Climate havens may not be something nature hands us, but something we have to build ourselves. And finding refuge doesn’t necessarily entail moving across the country; given the right preparations, it could be closer to home than you think. “While the climate is going to change, how we respond as a species, as a society, as individuals, I think will really determine what is a ‘refuge’ for us and what isn’t,” said Vivek Shandas, a professor at Portland State University whose research focuses on how cities can adapt to climate change. Shandas, who worked on the Northwest chapter of the report, says that it points to how human choices — policies and urban design decisions — have either put people more in harm’s way or brought them greater safety. Tulsa, Oklahoma, was once the country’s most frequently flooded city, according to the assessment. After a disaster in 1984 submerged 7,000 homes and killed 14 people, the city came together to fix the problem with an aggressive flood-control plan. They constructed a network of drainage systems, created green spaces to soak up water, and put strict rules on where new homes could be built. Over the last three decades, Tulsa has also cleared roughly 1,000 buildings out of flood zones through a buyout program. Officials say the effort has saved the city millions of dollars, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency gave Tulsa its top risk-reduction rating last year. That’s the kind of tough work that lies ahead of any Midwest city aiming to protect its residents. With dam failures and overflows from combined sewer and stormwater systems common, the region is unprepared to handle the volume of water now coursing in. “Just being more sheltered from certain dangers does not make you a haven,” said Julie Arbit, who researches equity and the environment at the University of Michigan. And flooding isn’t the only problem. Purported climate havens like Minneapolis, Duluth, Ann Arbor, and Madison, Wisconsin, will see some of the greatest temperature increases in the country in the coming decades. Residents of Michigan and Wisconsin face some of the longest power outages in the country. The idea that any city could be a climate haven traces back to Jesse Keenan, a professor of urban planning at Tulane University — though he suspects the phrase itself was invented by journalists. “People often associate me with coining that concept, but I don’t think I’ve ever used that phrase in any of my talks or writing,” Keenan said (though he did come up with “climate-proof Duluth.”) In 2018, the journalist Oliver Milman wrote an article for The Guardian looking at the parts of the U.S. that might be less miserable as the climate changes, calling Duluth and Buffalo “safe havens.” That framing took off the following year, making the headlines in Reuters, Yale Climate Connections, and Bloomberg. Keenan said he probably wouldn’t have used the phrase “climate havens,” though he does take credit for the proposition behind it. “The general idea is that there are places that people are going to move to, whether we like it or not, whether we plan for it or not,” he said. “We need to help those places and guide those places to prepare.” The idea of climate havens caught on, in part, because it was a hopeful message for post-industrial cities in the Great Lakes region, raising the prospect of filling vacant homes and revitalizing sluggish economies. Over the last two decades, more than 400,000 people left the Midwest for other regions of the United States. In 2019, Buffalo’s mayor called his city a “climate refuge.” The title is still embraced by some city planners: The 2023 Green Cincinnati Plan names the city a “climate haven.” The reality of climate change has weakened the phrase’s charm. Another factor that could be dampening enthusiasm for havens, according to Shandas, is that researchers aren’t getting much federal funding for their proposals to identify the role climate change plays in propelling migration patterns. The National Climate Assessment, for instance, points out that there’s yet not enough data to “make a strong statement” on how climate change might drive migration to the Midwest. Beth Gibbons, an author of the Midwest chapter of the report and the national resilience lead with the consulting group Farallon Strategies, says she’s heard many anecdotes of people moving to the Great Lakes in search of a less hostile climate. Most locals, however, don’t share politicians’ enthusiasm for a wave of climate migration to the Midwest. Interviews across Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Western New York have found that people are nervous about the prospect, Gibbons said. “By and large, the sense in communities is that we have a lot of challenges as it is,” Gibbons said, “and they’re not sure that this sounds like something that is really an opportunity, but rather something else that they may have to be dealing with.” Environmental justice advocates also worry that “the idea of being a climate haven is going to become a distraction from caring for people who are already here.” The “climate havens” conversation has largely revolved around the Midwest, but new research suggests that other parts of the country might be getting overlooked. The Climate Vulnerability Index, released by the Environmental Defense Fund and Texas A&M University last month, maps out risk across the United States on a neighborhood level, measuring environmental dangers alongside factors that make it harder for people to deal with hazards, such as income levels and access to health care. According to data provided to Grist, the least vulnerable counties are mostly rural and scattered across the northern part of the country, from Nantucket County, Massachusetts, to Juneau County, Alaska. The only Midwest spot to make the top 10 was Oneida County in Wisconsin. And the only place with a large population (numbering 600,000 people) on the list was Washington County, Oregon, which includes the east side of Portland. Portland has been named as a potential climate haven before, but the idea has recently fallen out of favor after the Pacific Northwest was struck by an off-the-charts heat dome in June 2021. It brought 116-degree temperatures to Portland, melting streetcar power cables and buckling pavement. In a region largely unaccustomed to owning air-conditioning units, roughly 1,000 people died across Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. “‘Nowhere is safe’: Heat shatters vision of Pacific Northwest as climate refuge,” read a headline in The Guardian at the time. Two years later, Portland and Seattle are more prepared for heat. “The Northwest went bananas with distributing heat pumps and AC units all over the place,” Shandas said. One bad disaster doesn’t necessarily cross a given place off the “havens” list; people can learn from past events and work to better survive the next disaster. And the reality is that most people are unlikely to pack up their belongings and move across the country to find refuge. There’s “no doubt that most people will be moving relatively locally,” Keenan said. He says that climate migration, even at a more local level, presents another opportunity to get it right when it comes to urban development. “We can either recreate crap suburban sprawl and high-carbon sprawl, or we can try to do it the right way. But we will branch into new cities in America, and those may be closer to home than we realize.” “Local refuges” might provide a better framework for discussing how to escape the worst of climate change, Shandas said. He borrowed the concept from the field of ecology, where the Latin “refugia” refers to areas where the climate conditions stay relatively safe over time, despite change happening around them. A local refuge could be a community center with air conditioning during a heat wave. Or it could mean moving out of a wildfire danger zone, or up the hill to escape frequent flooding. “For me, that’s a wonderful thought,” Shandas said, “because it allows humans to actually not be the victim of, like, ‘Oh my God, no matter where we go, we’re going to be crushed by this climate.’ And it’s like, ‘No, actually, there are things we can do.” This article originally appeared in Grist at https://grist.org/migration/climate-havens-national-climate-assessment-midwest-migration/.

QUESTION 1:Over the last decade, India’s edible oil imports have increased nearly 1.5 times and more than doubled in rupee terms. Body: — Imports of vegetable oils (as opposed to petroleum fuels) reached a record 16.5 million tonnes (mt) in the fiscal year ended October 2023, according to data from the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India (SEA). — In the last ten years, India’s edible oil imports have increased from 11.6 million tonnes (valued at Rs 60,750 crore) in 2013-14 to 16.5 million tonnes (Rs 138,424 crore) in 2022-23, with the increase being most pronounced in the last three years. — In 2022-23, India’s edible oil production from domestically grown oilseeds and alternative sources such as cottonseed, rice bran and maize/corn amounted to around 10.3 mt. — As with cotton, there have been spillover effects from increased rice and maize output in terms of byproducts. Oils extracted from bran (the outer brown layer of rice after husking and before polishing/whitening) and germ (the inside endosperm of maize grains separated during milling) have seen significant growth in production in the last decade or so. Oil from domestically grown palm trees has also been used, albeit at a low level. — Only mustard has kept its sheen among conventional oilseeds. Even though the amount of groundnut oil produced has increased, about half of the kernels are now exported or used directly for table use. Crushing and oil extraction take up very little of that remaining. It changes groundnut’s status from oilseed to more of a dry fruit. — The other oils — coconut, sesame, sunflower and safflower — have all registered declines in domestic output. — The 16.5 mt of edible oil imports in 2022-23 included palm (9.8 mt; from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand), soyabean (3.7 mt; from Argentina and Brazil) and sunflower (3 mt; from Russia,Ukraineand Argentina). — Being highly dependent on imports has several negative effects, one of which is that producers and consumers are more susceptible to changes in global prices. India’s edible oilinflationhas largely followed the global inflation rate. — The UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s vegetable oils price index (base period value: 2014-2016=100) soared from 98.7 points in August 2020 to an all-time-high of 251.8 points in March 2022, the month that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

(2022) QUESTION 2:Aditya L1 solar probe mission has captured its first high-energy solar flare in X-ray. Introduction: — The Indian Space Researcher Organisation’s (ISRO) Aditya L1 solar probe mission has completed an important milestone—it captured its first high-energy solar flare in X-ray. — The High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer (HEL1OS) on board Aditya-L1 recorded the impulsive phase of solar flares during its first observation period. Body: Payloads of Aditya L1 — Magnetometer:It is a dual triaxial magnetic sensor which is installed on a 6m, 5-segment deployable boom, mounted on the Sun facing deck of Aditya L1. The primary objective of MAG is to measure the magnitude and direction of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF). — Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC):It is the prime payload onboard India’s first space solar mission Aditya L1. It is designed as an internally occulted reflective coronagraph to meet the observational requirements. — High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer (HEL1OS):It is one of the instruments of Aditya L1 mission which aims to study the phenomenon occurring during the solar flares. — Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT):It is a UV telescope to image the solar disk. It uses narrow band (NB) and broad band (BB) spectral filters in the range of 200-400 nm, with low stray light and high contrast. — Solar Low Energy X-ray Spectrometer (SoLEXS):It is a soft X-ray sun as a start spectrometer. The main objective of SoLEXS is to continuously measure solar soft X-ray flux from the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L1. — Aditya Solar Wind Particle Experiment (ASPEX):It comprises of low and high energy particle spectrometers to carry out in-situ measurements of solar wind particles at the first Sun-Earth Lagrange point, L1. — Plasma Analyser Package for Aditya (PAPA):It aims to study the composition of solar wind and its energy distributions. It has two sensors, SWEEP (Solar Wind Electron Energy Probe) and SWICAR (Solar Wind Ion Composition Analyser). Effect of solar flares on Earth — Solar storms are classified into four types: B, C, M, and X. Solar flares, like the Richter scale, are classified on a logarithmic scale. So a C-class storm is ten times more powerful than a B-class storm, and so on. — While the X-class denotes the flare’s strength, the number following it denotes their strength on a finer scale. As a result, each class is subdivided into nine subdivisions. For example, X1 to X9. — Radiation and high energy particles from solar flares are harmful to living things. Fortunately, the Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere shield us from the effects of solar flares when we are on the surface. — The most dangerous emissions from flares are energetic charged particles (primarily high-energy protons) and electromagnetic radiation (primarily x-rays). — The X-rays from flares are stopped by our atmosphere well above the Earth’s surface. They do disturb the Earth’s ionosphere, however, which in turn disturbs radio communications. — They heat the Earth’s outer atmosphere and release intense UV radiation, which causes the atmosphere to expand. Because of this, satellites orbiting Earth experience increased drag, which shortens their orbital lifetime. Degradation of satellite communications can also result from intense radio emissions from flares and atmospheric variations; for instance, the accuracy of GPS measurements can be affected. Conclusion: — Studying solar flares and other space weather phenomena is important because they can affect life here on Earth. They can affect power systems, satellite communication systems and radio communications. During worst-case scenarios, they can cause blackouts that affect large parts of the Earth for hours. Studying solar flares and solar activity can help prepare for and insulate against such risks.

The busiest day… [+5346 chars]",Weather,"DALLAS --Despite inflation and memories of past holiday travel meltdowns, millions of people are expected to hit airports and highways in record numbers over theThanksgivingbreak. The busiest days to fly will be Tuesday and Wednesday as well as the Sunday after Thanksgiving. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 2.6 million passengers on Tuesday and 2.7 million passengers on Wednesday. Sunday will draw the largest crowds with an estimated 2.9 million passengers, which would narrowly eclipse a record set on June 30. Meanwhile, AAA forecasts that 55.4 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles (80 kilometers) from home between next Wednesday and the Sunday after Thanksgiving, with roads likely to be the most clogged on Wednesday. The weather could snarl air and road traffic. A storm system was expected to move from the southern Plains to the Northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday. Parts of Maine, Vermont and northern New Hampshire are expected to get 3 to 7 inches (7 to 17 centimeters) of snow between Tuesday night and Wednesday. U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said during a news conference Monday that the government has tried to better prepare for holiday travel by hiring more air traffic controllers, opening new air routes along the East Coast and providing grants to airports for snowplows and deicing equipment. He warned travelers to check road conditions and flight times before leaving home. “Mother Nature, of course, is the X factor in all of this,” he said. The good news for travelers by plane and car alike: Prices are coming down. Airfares are averaging $268 per ticket, down 14% from a year ago, according to the travel site Hopper. Gasoline prices are down about 37 cents a gallon from this time last year. The national average was $3.29 per gallon on Tuesday, according to AAA, down from $3.66 a year ago. A survey of GasBuddy users found that despite cheaper pump prices, the number of people planning to take a long driving trip this Thanksgiving hasn’t changed much from last year. Patrick De Haan, an analyst for the price-tracking service, said inflation has cooled but some things like food are still getting more expensive. Consumers are also charging more on credit cards and saving less. “Sure, they love the falling gas prices, but a lot of Americans spent in other ways this summer and they may not be ready to open their wallets for Thanksgiving travel just yet,” De Haan said. Jennifer Bonham opted to take the train from New York to Kansas City to spend Thanksgiving with her fiance after checking out flights and finding them “astronomically expensive."" ""My fiance had an idea. He's like, I wonder if there are trains? So we go to looking and it was honestly the best price that we got. I don’t have any money. I’m a single mom. The cheaper, the better,” said Bonham, while switching trains at Chicago's Union Station with her teenage daughter. Thanksgiving marks the start of the holiday travel season, and many still haven't shaken last December's nightmare before Christmas, when severe winter storms knocked out thousands of flights and left millions of passengers stranded. Scott Keyes, founder of the travel site Going, is cautiously optimistic that holiday air travel won’t be the same mess. So far this year, he said,airlineshave avoided massive disruptions. “Everyone understands that airlines can’t control Mother Nature,” Keyes said. “What really irks people are the controllable cancellations — those widespread disruptions because the airline couldn’t get their act together because their system melted down the way Southwest did over Christmas.” Indeed, Southwest didn’t recover as quickly as other carriers from last year's storm when its planes, pilots and flight attendants were trapped out of position and its crew-rescheduling system got bogged down. The airline canceled nearly 17,000 flights before fixing the operation. Federal regulators told Southwest recently that it could be fined for failing to help stranded travelers. Southwest officials say they have since purchased additional deicing trucks and heating equipment and will add staff at cold-weather airports depending on the forecast. The company said it has also updated its crew-scheduling technology. airlines as a whole have been better about stranding passengers. Through October, they canceled 38% fewer flights than during the same period in 2022. From June through August — when thunderstorms can snarl air traffic — the rate of cancellations fell 18% compared to 2022. Even still, consumer complaints about airline service have soared, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. There have been so many complaints, the agency says, that it has only compiled figures through May. The airlines, in turn, have heaped blame on theFederal Aviation Administration, which they say can’t keep up with the growing air traffic. In fact, the Transportation Department’s inspector general reported this summer that the FAA has made only “limited efforts” to fix a shortage of air traffic controllers, especially at key facilities in New York, Miami and Jacksonville, Florida. Meanwhile, staffing levels in other parts of the airline industry have largely recovered since shedding tens of thousands of workers early on in the pandemic. Passenger airlines have added more than 140,000 workers — an increase of nearly 40% — according to government figures updated last week. The number of people working in the business is the largest since 2001, when there were many more airlines. ___ Associated Press reporters Melissa Perez Winder in Chicago and Alexandra Olson in New York contributed to this story."

(NYSE: BURL), a nationally recognized off-price retailer of high-quality, branded apparel, footwear, accessories, and merchandise for the home at everyday low prices, today announced its results for the third quarter ended October 28, 2023. Michael O’Sullivan, CEO, stated, “We were pleased with our performance during the third quarter. We had a strong trend in August and September, and this drove 6% comparable store sales growth for the full quarter despite the negative impact of unseasonably warm weather in October. This trend together with strong merchandise margins delivered earnings at the high end of expectations.” Mr. O’Sullivan continued, “November is off to a solid start, helped by cooler weather at the beginning of the month. We feel very good about how we are set up for Holiday. That said, the critical high-volume weeks are still ahead of us, and we recognize that there is a lot of uncertainty in the external environment, so we are maintaining our previously issued Q4 guidance.” Mr. O’Sullivan added, “Right now our 2024 working assumption is for total sales growth of approximately 11% vs. 2023. This is driven by our expectations for 2% comp sales growth plus 100 net new store openings. Based on these growth rates, we would expect to be able to achieve about 50 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion vs. We will provide formal guidance in March 2024.” Mr. O’Sullivan concluded, “Looking further ahead, we are excited about the potential for our business over the next several years. We have a significant total sales growth opportunity driven by our new store program and comp sales growth, as well as meaningful operating margin expansion potential. We believe our strategic initiatives have the potential to drive significant sales and earnings growth for Burlington in the years ahead.” Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Operating Results (for the 13-week period ended October 28, 2023, compared with the 13-week period ended October 29, 2022) First Nine Months of Fiscal 2023 Results Inventory Liquidity and Debt Common Stock Repurchases OutlookFor the full Fiscal Year 2023 (the 53-weeks ending February 3, 2024), the Company now expects: For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023 (the 13 weeks ending January 27, 2024), the Company expects: The Company has not presented a quantitative reconciliation of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures set out above to their most comparable GAAP financial measures because it would require the Company to create estimated ranges on a GAAP basis, which would entail unreasonable effort. Adjustments required to reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP measures cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty but may include, among others, costs related to debt amendments, loss on extinguishment of debt, and impairment charges, as well as the tax effect of such items. Some or all of those adjustments could be significant. Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures The foregoing discussion of the Company’s operating results includes references to Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share (or Adjusted EPS), Adjusted EBIT (or Operating Margin), and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate. The Company believes these supplemental measures are useful in evaluating the performance of our business and provide greater transparency into our results of operations. In particular, we believe that excluding certain items that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude from what we consider to be our core operating results are useful supplemental measures that assist investors and management in evaluating our ability to generate earnings and leverage sales, and to more readily compare core operating results between past and future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures later in this document. From time to time when discussing its comparable store sales trends, the Company references its geometric stack, which is defined as a stacked comparable sales growth rate that accounts for the compounding of comparable store sales from Fiscal 2019 to Fiscal 2023.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures(Unaudited)(Amounts in thousands, except per share data) The following tables calculate the Company’s Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted SG&A and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, all of which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income, exclusive of the following items, if applicable: (i) net favorable lease costs; (ii) loss on extinguishment of debt; (iii) costs related to debt amendments; (iv) impairment charges; (v) amounts related to certain litigation matters; and (vi) other unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary expenses, losses, charges or gains, all of which are tax effected to arrive at Adjusted Net Income. Adjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by the diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as defined in the table below. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income, exclusive of the following items, if applicable: (i) interest expense; (ii) interest income; (iii) loss on extinguishment of debt; (iv) costs related to debt amendments; (v) income tax expense; (vi) depreciation and amortization; (vii) net favorable lease costs; (viii) impairment charges; (ix) amounts related to certain litigation matters; and (x) other unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary expenses, losses, charges or gains. Adjusted EBIT (or Adjusted Operating Margin) is defined as net income, exclusive of the following items, if applicable: (i) interest expense; (ii) interest income; (iii) loss on extinguishment of debt; (iv) costs related to debt amendments; (v) income tax expense; (vi) impairment charges; (vii) net favorable lease costs; (viii) amounts related to certain litigation matters; and (ix) other unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary expenses, losses, charges or gains. Adjusted SG&A is defined as SG&A less product sourcing costs, favorable lease costs and amounts related to certain litigation matters. Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as the GAAP effective tax rate less the tax effect of the reconciling items to arrive at Adjusted Net Income (footnote (g) in the table below). The Company presents Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted SG&A and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, because it believes they are useful supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of the Company’s business and provide greater transparency into the results of operations. In particular, the Company believes that excluding certain items that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude from what the Company considers to be its core operating results are useful supplemental measures that assist investors and management in evaluating the Company’s ability to generate earnings and leverage sales, and to more readily compare core operating results between past and future periods. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide investors helpful information with respect to the Company’s operations and financial condition. Other companies in the retail industry may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently such that the Company’s calculation may not be directly comparable. The following table shows the Company’s reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS for the periods indicated: The following table shows the Company’s reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated: The following table shows the Company’s reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBIT for the periods indicated: The following table shows the Company’s reconciliation of SG&A to Adjusted SG&A for the periods indicated: The following table shows the reconciliation of the Company’s effective tax rates on a GAAP basis to the Adjusted Effective Tax Rates for the periods indicated: The following table shows the Company’s reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income for the prior period Adjusted EPS amounts used in this press release for the periods indicated: (a) Net favorable lease costs represents the non-cash expense associated with favorable and unfavorable leases that were recorded as a result of purchase accounting related to the April 13, 2006 Bain Capital acquisition of Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corporation.

Named in honor of former U.S. ... [+] Senator George Mitchell for his contributions to the Northern Ireland peace process, the scholarships cover the costs of a year of graduate study in Ireland or Northern Ireland. (Photo by Charles McQuillan/Getty Images) The 12 George J. Mitchell Scholars for the Class of 2025 have been selected. The announcement of the new cohort was made Monday by the US-Ireland Alliance, which conducts the selection process. The scholars will begin their studies in September 2024. Despite a relatively short history (the first scholars were named in 2001), the Mitchell Scholarship has become one of the country’s most prestigious postgraduate awards. This year about 350 applicants competed for the 12 scholarships, which cover educational expenses for a year of graduate study - including all tuition, room and board and a monthly stipend to cover living expenses - at one of several participating universities in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Senator George Mitchell for his crucial contributions to the Northern Ireland peace process, the scholarship is “designed to introduce and connect generations of future American leaders to the island of Ireland, while recognizing and fostering intellectual achievement, leadership, and a commitment to community and public service.” Trina Vargo, the founder of the program and the president of the US-Ireland Alliance, noted that “this year marks the 25th anniversary of the Alliance, the scholarship program, and the Good Friday peace agreement. That agreement was chaired by Senator Mitchell.” Vargo had been employed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy and served as his foreign policy adviser during the critical years of the Northern Ireland peace process. Eligible candidates must be U.S. citizens between the ages of 18 and 30 and have completed or be completing their undergraduate degree. Scholars are selected on the basis of academic merit, demonstrated leadership and a commitment to community and public service. Applicants go through a lengthy review process before their final selection by a committee, many members of which are Mitchell alumni. Tyler Bartolome is a senior at Drake University with four majors - biochemistry, cell and molecular biology; mathematics; biology; and chemistry. He is also the founder and president of the Oral Record Institute, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that collects and curates oral histories of individuals who’ve experienced military conflict. Tyler plans to study biotechnology at University College Cork. Sam Bisno is a senior at Princeton University, where he studies history. He is the recipient of the Carter Combe Prize for the best junior-year independent work in history at Princeton. Sam also is Editor-in-Chief of the Princeton Historical Review and Editor-in-Chief of The Nassau Weekly. Sam will study history at Queen’s University Belfast. A senior at the University of Alabama, Anika Cho, is studying electrical engineering and physics. She is interested in developing acoustic technologies for oceanic exploration. Anika will study electrical & electronic engineering at University College Cork. Anna Clark is a senior at Stanford University pursuing a BS in engineering physics and a MSc in management science & engineering. She is the president of the Stanford Energy Club, which connects students to energy careers and research. Anna will study smart and sustainable cities at Trinity College Dublin. Owen Emerson is a senior at the University of Alabama studying economics. A guitarist and singer-songwriter, he wants to become a documentarian and educator of Appalachian-Irish musical heritage. Owen plans to study music and media technologies at Trinity College Dublin. Thomas “Tommy” Hagan earned a BA in philosophy from the University of Chicago. For the past decade, he has entered prisons and jails on a weekly basis to build community with incarcerated people. Interested in comparing prison systems, Tommy will study peace and conflict studies at Ulster University. A recent graduate of Duke University, Christopher Kuo majored in political science and English. Currently, he is a Reporting Fellow on the culture desk at the New York Times. Chris will study journalism at the University of Limerick. Elizaveta “Lisa” Maslovskaya is a senior at the University of Oklahoma studying creative media production and French. An immigrant from Russia, Lisa is an award-winning documentary filmmaker who filmed Hurricane Ian in Florida where she and her team focused on journalists and meteorologists who continued reporting the news throughout the storm. Lisa will study documentary practice at Dublin City University. Chloe Nguyen is a senior at Duke University majoring in public policy with a minor in psychology. She is the founder of the Duke Justice Project, a club addressing mass incarceration and improving re-entry in North Carolina. Chloe plans to study digital policy at University College Dublin. After earning her undergraduate degree in psychology from Bryn Mawr College, Isabel Plakas is pursuing a master’s degree in nursing at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing. She’s the recipient of a Nursing Scholar Award from the National Association of Hispanic Nurses and was recognized by the Boston Medical Center for building harm reduction programming at a shelter site that also served as a 24/7 overdose monitoring unit. Isabel will study study addiction recovery at Trinity College Dublin. Kiera Sky Torpie graduated from Tulane University with a degree in linguistics and international development. Her relationship with her incarcerated father was significantly influenced by their letters. Based on that experience, she created a workshop at Tulane for girls whose families had been impacted by incarceration, and last summer, she took her play, Sunny Makes a Scene, to the Festival Fringe in Edinburgh. Kiera will study creative writing at Queen’s University Belfast. Coleman Yorke was an undergraduate at Columbia University where he studied English and psychology, and a Masters’ student at Oxford University focusing on clinical and therapeutic neuroscience. He currently lives in South Korea, where as a Luce Scholar, he’s working in a lab at Yonsei University focusing on adolescent mental healthcare. Coleman will study global mental health at Trinity College Dublin. At the beginning of the program, the U.S. State Department provided $485,000 in annual funding. After that ended around 2012, Ireland’s Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science picked up the ball and continues to provide yearly support. Over the years, a number of individuals and foundations have also provided additional funding, including Morgan Stanley, Pfizer, the O’Sullivan Foundation, the Pritzker Foundation, Michael Hackman of The MBS Group and Hackman Capital, and Strong Roots. Almost 80% of program alumni make financial contributions as well. Unlike many other prestigious scholarships - think Rhodes, Gates, Schwarzman - the Mitchell Scholarship was started and continues to operate without a supporting endowment. Vargo has written about the need to find a philanthropist, company or governmental entity to underwrite the scholarship so that it and the good will it generates can be sustained."

By RFA Burmese 2023.11.20 -- Junta soldiers have blocked highways and waterways throughout western Myanmar's Rakhine state, halting the flow of medicine, fuel and other basic commodities as the regime contends with renewed attacks from the Arakan Army, an ethnic rebel group, several local residents told Radio Free Asia on Monday. Troops have set up security checkpoints on roads linking towns and villages in both southern and northern Rakhine state, and the drivers of buses and cargo trucks have been stranded on the roadside after being denied access to the Sittwe-Yangon highway. ""They said that the blockade will be lifted only when security returns to normal,"" the driver of a passenger bus who requested anonymity for security reasons told RFA. ""So, we prepare our meals here."" The road and waterway closures began on Nov. 13, shortly after the Arakan Army ended a year-old ceasefire when it attacked police outposts and junta convoys in Rathedaung and Minbya townships. The offensive in Rakhine state coincided with the Arakan Army's participation in Operation 1027 - named after the Oct. 27 start of the military offensive - as part of the ""Three Brotherhood Alliance"" with two other armed ethnic groups against the military in Shan state in the north. Roadblocks over the last week have included detailed inspections, residents said. The military has also imposed a curfew between 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. in Sittwe, Rakhine's state capital. ""No one can travel,"" a Sittwe resident told RFA. ""People in cities will face more difficulties as all the businesses have stopped."" 'Strategy to bring misery' The junta is causing trouble to discourage people from supporting the Arakan Army, according to Rakhine politician Pe Than. ""It's a strategy to bring misery for people,"" he said. ""The military is forcing people to blame the [Arakan Army] for the troubles."" When there were clashes between junta soldiers and the Arakan Army in August 2022, the military regime also blocked access to towns in northern Rakhine, and also arrested civilians, Pe Than said. Several months later, the Arakan Army agreed to a ceasefire, he noted. RFA called the junta spokesman for Rakhine, Hla Thein, for comment on the blockades, but the calls went unanswered. Junta spokesman Major Gen. Zaw Min Tun told the Myanma Alin newspaper that the fighting with the Arakan Army has delayed the development of Rakhine state. RFA tired to contact Arakan Army spokesman Khine Thukha for a response to that remark but was unable to reach him. In May, Cyclone Mocha devastated much of Rakhine. Hungry and shelterless residents have complained for months of slow or nonexistent aid delivery in the aftermath of the storm. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said on Friday that most humanitarian activities have been suspended because of ""the resurgence of conflict"" and ""movement restrictions between urban and rural areas."" More than 26,000 people across nine townships in Rakhine fled from junta artillery attacks last week, OCHA said on Friday. Translated by Aung Naing. Edited by Matt Reed and Malcolm Foster.

According to the latest research by InsightAce Analytic, theGlobal Hazard Vulnerability Analysis For Healthcare Facilities Marketis expected to witness aCAGR of 7.36%during the forecast period of 2023-2031. Hazard vulnerability analysis (HVA) is a scientific method for pinpointing potential threats to a hospital and its surrounding neighbourhood. The CMS Emergency Preparedness Rule also mandates risk assessments and HVAs. For healthcare facilities to remain accredited and in conformity with government and healthcare regulatory organization norms and standards, comprehensive hazard vulnerability analysis must be implemented. Market expansion can be attributable to expanding healthcare institutions' requirement for integrated risk management systems that involve hazard vulnerability analysis as a major component. Natural disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and wildfires, are becoming more common and more devastating. Healthcare facilities are understanding the significance of doing extensive hazard vulnerability analysis. However, Healthcare institutions must ensure compliance with tight data protection requirements and maintain patient confidentiality at all times, which might delay the implementation of modern technology and data-driven hazard vulnerability analysis solutions. This is because polymer films are slow to decompose and might cause damage to the environment. Free PDF Report Brochure @https://www.insightaceanalytic.com/request-sample/2209 List of Prominent Players in the Hazard Vulnerability Analysis For Healthcare Facilities Market: Hazard Vulnerability Analysis For Healthcare Facilities Market Report Scope: Market Dynamics: Drivers: The growing demand for hazard vulnerability analysis for healthcare facilities is fueled by the increased frequency of severe weather events like hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and wildfires. Healthcare facilities are realizing they require thorough hazard vulnerability analysis to guarantee they are ready for any eventuality. They also implement a complete hazard vulnerability analysis to ensure compliance with the government and healthcare regulatory bodies' stringent norms and regulations for the industry. Challenges: The prime challenge is a lack of awareness and high cost, a shortage of competent individuals, and a lack of norms and protocol because of lockdowns and isolation in emerging countries, which is predicted to slow the growth of the hazard vulnerability analysis for the healthcare facilities market. Smaller healthcare facilities may struggle to afford the high upfront costs of implementing comprehensive hazard vulnerability analysis due to the need to purchase expensive equipment, train staff, and upgrade infrastructure. The efficient adoption and maintenance of comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation techniques in healthcare settings might be hampered by a lack of competent staff in conducting hazard vulnerability analysis and designing effective risk management strategies. After the COVID-19 pandemic, Cybersecurity risks are increasingly being prioritized by healthcare organizations. While supply chain and financial organizations are prime targets for cybercriminals because of their significance to the economy, they are not the only ones that could be attacked. Cybersecurity assaults, such as data breaches, phishing, and ransomware, pose a particularly high risk to the healthcare industry. Regional Trends: The North American hazard vulnerability analysis for the healthcare facilities market is anticipated to register a major market share in revenue. It is projected to grow at a high CAGR in the near future due to technological advancements and affluence. North America dominates the market due to the region's well-established healthcare infrastructure, cutting-edge technology, and widespread awareness of the importance of catastrophe preparedness.

Studies also suggests that women are more affected by climate anxiety than men. The rise of wildfires, floods and droughts around the world are just some of the highly visible signs of climate change. What is reported less is the impact of climate change on human minds. Climate anxiety - defined as feelings of distress about the impacts of climate change - has been reported globally, particularly among children and young people. Data from Google Trends shows that search queries related to ""climate anxiety"" have increased dramatically. Search queries in English around ""climate anxiety"" in the first 10 months of 2023 are 27 times higher than the same period in 2017. There have been surges related to climate anxiety in other world languages over the same period. These are not the languages with the most commonly searched queries around climate anxiety but are just some of the world languages the BBC asked Google to look at. Searches may be higher among speakers of languages with greater awareness of climate anxiety, or among those who use Google most often and do not necessarily suggest that people in countries with bigger shares of search queries are more prone to experiencing climate anxiety. The Google Trends data combines search queries for ""climate anxiety"" and ""eco-anxiety"", terms which are often used in the same way but which have slightly different meanings. Climate anxiety is anxiety specifically associated with awareness of climate change. Eco-anxiety is a more general anxiety associated with awareness of threats to environmental health, including pollution and loss of biodiversity. Google Trends does not simply measure the total volume of searches but looks at a sample of searches to identify trends around the world. It uses a measure called ""search interest"", to look at the relative popularity of search queries over time. Nordic countries had the biggest share of global search queries related to climate anxiety over the past five years. In fact, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway accounted for more than 40% of search queries related to ""climate anxiety"". Google says that its data is adjusted to account for differences in overall search volume, which allows it to compare countries of various population sizes. That's why smaller countries may top the ranking instead of more populated ones. Countries in the Global South - such as Chile, the Philippines and South Africa - represented smaller shares of search queries. Countries with low search volumes have been excluded from the analysis. Google says it has also noted a global increase in search queries about the future of the planet together with queries about the environment in the last 12 months. ""When you look at the kind of queries people are searching for, it's evident that they are seeking understanding, but also wanting to take action,"" a spokesperson said. ""For example, 'how to solve climate change' was one of the trending queries about climate change worldwide in the last two years."" Google data shows a rise in queries about the future together with climate change (up 120%), adaptation (up 120%), sustainability (up 40%) and greenhouse gas emissions (up 120%) in the last 12 months. Trending queries worldwide about climate change include Spanish language searches such as ""cuales son los riesgos del cambio climático?"" or ""what are the risks of climate change?"" (up 150%). Google did not release data on the gender of people searching for queries related to ""climate anxiety"" but research has indicated that women are more predisposed to climate anxiety than men. Findings from a 2023 study published in the academic journal Sustainability, for example, showed that female respondents around the world reported ""greater levels of concern and negative emotions"" about climate change. Male respondents, on the other hand, were ""more optimistic and expressed greater faith in government"". The study was based on an online survey of 10,000 people aged 16 to 25 across 10 countries carried out in 2021. Analysis of more than 44,000 respondents from the European Social Survey in 2019 also concluded that women registered greater concern about climate change than men. Professor Susan Clayton, who co-authored the Sustainability study, has some possible explanations for this. She says that one reason women consistently report higher levels of concern is that they are more open to discussing emotions. ""Women are in general more willing, and may be able to acknowledge their own emotional response [to climate change]. So they seem to think about their emotions, and they are more willing to talk about them, compared to men in general,"" she says. But she also says that some women may worry more about climate change because they are at greater risk than men of experiencing some of the real-life impacts. ""After an extreme weather event you frequently find increased levels of domestic violence, and when people are involuntarily displaced, due to climate change, that opens women to the threat of sexual violence or trafficking,"" she says. ""Also, women are often physiologically vulnerable to climate change. So high temperatures and air pollution can have an impact during pregnancy and the ways pregnancy affects a woman's body may make it more difficult for her to escape extreme climate conditions."" There is some research which suggests women are more likely than men to die in climate change-related disasters. For example, a study looking at cyclones in Bangladesh between 1983 and 2009 suggested that women had an increased mortality risk compared to the general adult population. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says it's likely that humans have contributed to the increased intensity of some cyclones. Professor Clayton says that gender-based inequalities mean that some women in poorer countries may lack access to information following a climate change event. They are less likely to be able to travel to a place of safety, and may have caring responsibilities that mean they prioritise the safety of others over themselves. Indirect and longer-term impacts of climate change can also be detrimental to the wellbeing of women and girls. ""Some studies have shown that girls are married earlier when the family is facing economic pressures associated with the changing conditions of climate change. ""For example, maybe agriculture is threatened by droughts or floods and so because of their economic constraints families want to marry off their daughters, so they don't have to feed the daughters themselves,"" Professor Clayton adds. In 2022, the IPCC reported on the mental health impacts of climate change for the first time. This year's COP28 in Dubai will also feature several discussions about mental health. Just as the physical impacts of climate change are on the rise, so too is the attention paid to its impacts on the mind.

The potholes on the road are too many, and that is why so many people have incurred several degrees of injuries on this road.“A few months ago, a woman who lives in Bakin Rijiya community with her 15-year-old son had a motor accident and died as a result of the deplorable condition of the road while they were on the way to their village. It was a head-on collision with another vehicle. The boy died on the spot, but his mother died after a few days in the hospital because she sustained too many injuries from the accident,” he stated.Continuing, he further informed, “Just recently, another accident happened on this road which claimed the life of an old man. The man was badly injured and was rushed to the hospital, but he did not survive. Another pregnant woman who was walking by the side of the road was also hit by a vehicle, and she died instantly.“I am appealing to the Federal Government to help us repair the road. The challenges we have been facing on this road are too many, so we really need the help of the government,” he pleaded.Another resident of the area, Dantala Usman, a peasant farmer in Mai-Akuya community in the area, lamented the absence of the police and other security agencies on the Lafia-Shendam road, a situation which has increased the activities of bandits who indiscriminately storm the communities around the area.He said, “I am a peasant farmer, and after harvest, I transport my farm produce to Asakiyo market to sell and make a profit. But with the activities of the criminals who block the road almost on a daily basis, I am now very scared to ply the road because I don’t want to be kidnapped or get killed.“There is no police or military checkpoint all the way from Lafia to Sabon-gida Bakin Kogi, which is the boundary between Nasarawa and Plateau states. So, the bandits are attacking and kidnapping our people, and nothing is being done about it.”Related NewsGovernorship Election Live UpdatesMotorists lament potholes on Third Mainland BridgeWe fixed 300 federal roads in 2019 — FERMAA commercial driver, Yusuf Zubeiru, who said he had been plying the road for over 10 years, told of his horrible tales and experience on the road due to its bad condition, to our correspondent.According to him, “As a commercial driver, I have been plying this Lafia-Shendam road for over 10 years now. I must say that it has been difficult for me all these years because of the bad nature of the road and the insecurity that we are experiencing. As a driver, I do not have a choice because I have to work in order to take good care of my family members.“The activities of armed robbers and kidnappers are very worrisome. Almost every Monday, they mount roadblocks on the road to collect money from businessmen and women who are going to the Asakiyo market to buy goods. We are passing through a very difficult situation, and we were told that it is a federal road so the Federal Government should help us repair the road,” he remarked.A top government official at the Federal Ministry of Works who pleaded for anonymity because he was not authorised to speak on the matter, said the ministry had been doing its best to attend to the road in order to reduce the loss of lives of Nigerians who ply the road.He said, “We have been attending to the road from kilometre 25 to 53. We understand the plight of Nigerians who ply the road on a daily basis, and that is why we have been doing our best to address the issue. If you go through the road, you will see that we have been able to patch some bad spots, but there are still some places to be attended to which we are trying to repair.”However, the source observed that the road from kilometre zero to 25 which was left for the Federal Roads Maintenance Agency to repair had yet to be fixed, and thus wondered why they had not attended to it.“FERMA is supposed to repair the road from kilometre zero to 25, but I don’t know why they have not done anything about it,” our source revealed.Meanwhile, more investigations by Arewa PUNCH indicated that in the last two years, FERMA had awarded and paid the sum of N366 million to four different contractors for the general maintenance of the road.Statistics from the Open Treasury Platform and BudgIT reveals that in March 2023, the Federal Government through its Road Maintenance Agency paid the sum of N78 million to Classic Marvel Nigeria Limited for general maintenance and repairs of the Lafia-Shendam road.In August 2022, the sum of N122 million was paid by FERMA to Quantum Mechanics Limited for the rehabilitation of the road.In the months of June and October 2021, a total sum of N134 million was paid by FERMA to Mainstream Contractors Nigeria for the emergency repairs of the road and in July of the same year, the sum of N32 million was paid to Sahar Continental Limited for its maintenance.When our correspondent approached the FERMA Director, East Operations, Olaniyi Kolawole, to explain why the road is still in such terrible shape despite the different contracts recently awarded for its rehabilitation, he claimed that all the maintenance had been done according to specifications.Kolawole insisted that the agency had no issues with the nature of work done on the Lafia-Shendam road, adding that the contractors would not have been paid and certificates issued to them if the jobs were not properly done.According to him, “Yes, FERMA awarded some contracts in the past years and even in the present year on that road. And when the description says Lafia-Shendam, it doesn’t mean that it is the entire road from the beginning to the end that needs to be repaired.“Our contracts have been to make the road passable all the time. All these monies that were paid on the contracts were actually for specific location repairs,” he noted.

Tacloban, The Philippines– Twice a month for the last 10 years, pig farmer Alejandro Sumayang has planted mangrove plants along the shoreline a few metres from his home. Pushing a stick into the muddy ground, he creates a hole for the seedling, tying it to a piece of bamboo to prevent the tide from washing it away. “This is what shields me,” he said, crouching to inspect a recently planted row of plants. The back of Sumayang’s makeshift house faces the Pacific Ocean in the Philippines’s central Leyte province. Ten years ago, on November 8, 2013, tsunami-like waves whipped up bySuper Typhoon Haiyancrashed into his home in Silago, leaving only broken wooden beams standing amid the wreckage. Haiyanwas one of the strongest typhoons ever to make landfall. More than 6,300 people were killed as the storm swept across the island of Leyte, flattening homes and causing a storm surge that swamped entire neighbourhoods. The government said at least 13 million people were affected. Leyte wasstruck againby a typhoon in December 2021. Typhoon Rai rivalled Haiyan’s intensity. “I’d have lost my house again if we hadn’t planted anything. From afar we could see the waves losing their momentum, breaking apart before they reached the shore,” Sumayang told Al Jazeera. About 20 typhoons a year enter Philippine territory. For the last 12 years, the Southeast Asian archipelago has kept the top spot for the most vulnerable and at-risk country for natural disasters in theWorld Risk Indexproduced by Germany’s Ruhr University Bochum. In Haiyan’s wake, several coastal communities began mangrove reforestation efforts, arguing nature was the most effective way to deal with the effects of climate change. Four villages in Silago were among the first to start, working with NGOs and village officials to begin planting a year after the disaster. The characteristic bulbous roots and flat leaves of the varying types of mangrove now line 215sq km (83 sq miles) of the town’s coastal area. The Leyte Center for Development (LCDE), a humanitarian organisation which supported the planting in Silago, believes the plants helped save 2,000 coastal residents from Rai’s onslaught. “It is a testament to the effectiveness of an eco-systems-based approach and it cost the people practically nothing,” said the LCDE’s director Minet Aguisanda-Jerusalem. There has been little support from any officials at the municipal level or above, however. The government has instead backed man-made interventions including a vast concrete sea wall in Tacloban City, Leyte’s capital. Construction on the 16.9 billion Philippine peso ($304.5m) Storm Surge Protection Project (SSPP) began in 2016. The 44.48km (27.6 miles) long concrete seawall was supposed to have been finished by 2020 but only 58 percent of the work has been done. Delays have been caused by “Right-Of-Way Acquisitions, fluctuating prices of materials [and] request of additional features in the tide embankment”, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) regional office told Al Jazeera in an email. Along some sections of the SSPP, the wall has already started to crack and crumble, exposing the steel rebars inside to the elements. But the DPWH is standing by the project. In a report it shared with Al Jazeera, it advised engineering offices on the island “to adopt the SSPP standards in protecting their shores all over the region”. Professor William Holden, an environmental geographer from the University of Calgary who is studying the situation in Tacloban, says that even when the wall is finished, it will probably not be enough to protect the city. “Climate change means warmer air holding more water and thus heavier rainfall events. So there’s no way engineers can predict how big of a seawall to build. Future typhoons will eventually dwarf Haiyan,” said Holden, who suspects the maintenance of the SSPP will also prove costly. Jon Bonifacio, the national coordinator for the environmental advocacy group Kalikasan, worries the wall could even exacerbate the effects of climate change, because it risks trapping any water that enters the city during a storm and causing prolonged flooding. He is also critical of the social cost of the project, which required thousands of coastal residents to leave their homes, separating them from their livelihoods. He faults the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr for continuing the state’s “obsession with grey infrastructure” as it “ends up displacing impacts rather than eliminating climate change impacts”. The Philippines is home to 46 of the world’s 70 species of mangrove trees and shrubs, which thrive in the tidal saltwater shallows where the land meets the sea. While research has shown the plants help reduce coastal communities’ vulnerability to tsunamis and storm surges, they are also under threat. The Philippines is estimated to have lost about 49 percent of its mangrove forests since 1920. Professor Eduardo Mangaoang, the founder of the Regional Climate Change R&D Center at Visayas State University in Leyte, urged authorities to heed the beneficial science behind mangroves. “The stems and bodies are a natural breakwater system against strong waves. It stabilises and holds shoreline soil together and is a nursery for fish,” Mangaoang explained to Al Jazeera. In 2014, Jecel Espina-Pedel, a 14-year-old from Silago and a self-described “nature lover”, joined the hundreds of others in a coordinated mangrove planting effort. Gazing out of her window, she remembers seeing the first leaves sprout in just six months. Within a few years, the surrounding soil was totally transformed. “The ground went from rocky to muddy. We could see small holes which were new habitats. We looked under rocks and saw fish we’d never seen here before,” she explained, still thrilled by what happened. Pedel comes from a family of fisherfolk. Before long, they were often eating shellfish for dinner and selling the rest of their catch by the roadside. “It has multiple co-benefits: food sources, science-based, and it creates a carbon sink. It’s internationally recognised. But locally, there isn’t a comprehensive plan for this,” Gerry Arances, the director of the Center for Energy, Ecology and Development in Manila, told Al Jazeera. For mangroves to survive, the correct varieties of seedlings must be chosen and placed properly along the shore. In 2015, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) drew flak for using improper methods in a 1 billion Philippine peso ($18m) mangrove reforestation project. In 2023, advocates againcriticisedthe department for repeating the mistake in Bohol and Negros Occidental. Mangaoang attributes the success in areas like Silago to the attention of local residents who continue planting while keeping the mangroves free of barnacles and other parasites. The academic travels all over the region promoting mangroves. In his town of Baybay, Leyte, he finally convinced Mayor Jose Carlos Cari to support a community mangrove plan for next year, a first for the region. Overall, Mangaoang says, community-coordinated mangrove planting is “still at the early stages. Coastal communities have a lot of local practices that need support. They themselves are scientists, they just don’t know it.” The government, however, continues to expand its engineering interventions in Leyte. In February of this year, construction began on the Tacloban City Causeway. According to the DPWH, the 4.5 billion Philippine peso ($81.1m) 2.5km (1.5 miles) road will reduce city travel time and “protect the life and property of the residents/constituents in the area from erosive tidal actions”. The road embankment will be built on reclaimed land. That entails bulldozing the mangroves along Cancabato Bay, classified as a protected area by the city for its biodiversity. The bay is a popular fishing ground and its mangrove density was increased by the local fishing community after Haiyan. “There needs to be proper planning around these issues,” said Ian Fry, the United Nations special rapporteur on the protection of human rights in the context of climate change, after visiting Tacloban during the 10th-year commemoration of Haiyan. He called the potential loss of mangroves a “serious concern”. Roque Regis, a bay area community leader, estimates their own efforts have added an extra 30 percent to the bay’s mangroves since Haiyan. He called the government “deaf” for ignoring its own protections over the bay and residents’ pleas to halt construction. After the typhoon, “they displaced everyone living near the coast”, Regis told Al Jazeera. “Now they’re set to do the same in Cancabato Bay. They want to ‘clean up’ the area for tourists. But they’re taking down our homes and our fishing grounds.” With the Philippine government’s response to climate disaster unfinished, affected communities remain convinced that the solution to future problems remains with nature. They plan to persist in their defence of the trees that they believe both save and nurture them. “There were doubters when we started planting, saying the mangroves would be home to snakes, or that they wouldn’t work. But look at us here, we are protected. This is a gift to the people,” said Sumayang. Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Developing nations are seeking compensation for the i… [+471 chars]",Science,"NEW DELHI: Sunil Kumar watched helplessly in July as his home and 14 others were washed away by intense monsoon rains lashing the Indian Himalayas. ""All my life's work vanished in an instant. Starting over feels impossible, especially with my three children relying on me,"" said Kumar, a waste collector in the village of Bhiuli, in the mountainous state of Himachal Pradesh.This year's monsoon season in India was devastating, with local governments estimating 428 deaths and more than $1.42 billion in property damage in the region. But India was just one of many developing nations to suffer from extreme weather made worse or more likely by climate change, caused largely by greenhouse gas emissions that result from the burning of fossil fuels. Tropical storm Daniel hammered Libya with massive flooding in September, and Cyclone Freddy battered several African nations early in the year. Activists say all three disasters show how poorer nations, which historically have contributed less to climate change because they have emitted fewer planet-warming gases than developed countries, are often hit hardest by the impacts of global warming. Developing nations had long sought to address the problem, and finally broke through with an agreement at last year's annual United Nations climate talks, known as Cop27, to create what's known as a loss and damage fund. But many details were left unresolved, and dozens of contentious meetings were held in the year since to negotiate things like who would contribute to it, how large it would be, who would administer it, and more. A draft agreement was finally reached earlier this month, just a few weeks before this year's Cop28 talks open Nov. 30 in Dubai. The agreement will be up for final approval at the climate talks, and dissatisfaction from both wealthy and developing nations could block approval or require additional negotiations. ""For us, it's a matter of justice,"" said New Delhi-based Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, a group that spent the past decade lobbying to compensate those nations. ""Poor communities in developing countries are losing their farms, homes, and incomes due to a crisis caused by developed countries and corporations."" A recent report by the United Nations estimates that up to $387 billion will be needed annually if developing countries are to adapt to climate-driven changes. Even if details of a loss and damage fund are worked out, some are skeptical that it will raise anything close to that amount. A Green Climate Fund that was first proposed at the 2009 climate talks in Copenhagen, and began raising money in 2014, hasn't come close to its goal of $100 billion annually. Chandra Bhushan, head of New Delhi-based climate think tank International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology, said he doesn't expect countries to contribute more than a few billion dollars to the loss and damage fund. ""Developing countries should be ready to manage these events independently, as seen with COVID-19. They can't always rely on others,"" Bhushan said. The draft agreement calls for the World Bank to temporarily host the fund for the next four years. It lays out basic goals for the fund, including its planned launch in 2024, and specifies how it will be administered and who will oversee it, with a requirement that developing countries get a seat on the board. The agreement asks developed countries to contribute to the fund but says other countries and private parties can, too. It says allocations will prioritize those most vulnerable to climate change, but any climate-affected community or country is eligible. Developing nations were disappointed that the agreement didn't specify a scale for the fund, and wasn't more specific about who must contribute. They also wanted a new and independent entity to host the fund, accepting the World Bank only reluctantly. They see the organization, whose president is typically appointed by the United States, as part of a global finance system that has often saddled them with crushing loans that make it more difficult to Cope with the costs of climate change. They have long argued that there is a need for a larger, better coordinated pool of money that's available without deepening debt crises. ""This arrangement won't provide the new fund with true independence, will obstruct direct access to vulnerable communities, and will lack full accountability to governments and those most affected by climate change,"" said RR Rashmi, a former climate negotiator with the Indian government who is now a distinguished fellow at New Delhi-based think-tank The Energy Resources Institute. Meanwhile, wealthy nations sought to limit countries eligible for payments from the fund to the most vulnerable, like Afghanistan and Bangladesh in Asia, several African countries as well as island nations such as Kiribati, Samoa and Barbados. They also said all nations should contribute, particularly rapidly growing countries like China and Saudi Arabia. ""It's important that the fund focuses on the poorest and most vulnerable. Those who have the strength and resources to contribute should do so,"" said Dan Jorgensen, Denmark's minister for global climate policy. The US State Department expressed disappointment that the draft agreement didn't specifically describe donations as voluntary despite what it said was broad consensus among negotiators. Brandon Wu is director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid USA, a nonprofit that pressed the US to help reach a recommended agreement that could be taken to Cop28. He said that unhappiness could still lead to discussions on the fund being re-opened in Dubai, but negotiators are under heavy pressure to deliver. ""Many believe this Cop will be judged a success or failure based on whether or not it happens,"" Wu said. ""The UAE presidency has a huge interest in ensuring it does."" Representatives from developing countries say it was critical to get the draft agreement in early November, and failure to approve it at Cop28 would be the worst outcome. Samoa's UN ambassador, Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Pa'olelei Luteru, also chairs the Alliance of Small Island States. He said the world's most industrialized nations have a ""moral responsibility"" to move as quickly as possible on climate reparations. ""We cannot continue with the path that we have taken over the last 30 years,"" he said."

Paul Gilbert found his mother Maureen, 83, dead in flood water inside her home in Chesterfield last month. He said said the street was trying to come to terms with the tragedy but had been ""let down"" by the council's response. Chesterfield Borough Council said it was supporting residents. Mr Gilbert, who has being trying to clear up the wreckage in the home in Tapton Terrace, where his mother lived all her life, said: ""It's horrible being down here. ""It's taking too long [for help] to come through. You're having to ring the council up to get them to come and collect rubbish. ""It's very difficult. We are having to fight for everything. We have been let down again."" The street flooded when the nearby River Rother burst its banks during heavy rain and water swept into 26 properties. Some residents said insurance companies had been so busy they had been unable to send loss adjusters to survey damage. Mrs Gilbert's neighbour, Stephanie Winnard, said she was still in the process of getting her house dried out after it was deluged by 5ft (1.5m) of water. She said: ""It's absolutely devastating. It's still very stressful. It hits you so hard every time you come in and you see your house in a state like this."" Businesses in the town are also counting the cost of the flooding. The cellar and ground floor of the Anchor pub, in Factory Street, was submerged during the storm and had to close for a week. Joint owner Layonie Rawson said previous issues with flooding had made it impossible to get insurance. She said: ""We had loss of revenue and repairs and replacing equipment and we are pushing around £20,000 [of costs]. ""We just had to crack on. We are really lucky we have had a support form friends and family and members of the community. Everyone just chipped in. ""We have even had help from people we don't know turning up with packages of cleaning supplies even food parcels."" Leader of Chesterfield Borough Council Tricia Gilby said: ""This has been an incredibly challenging period for the town and borough but Chesterfield is a resilient place, and our communities pull together like no other at such times. ""Over the last month we have been supporting our residents and businesses with the huge clean-up, and providing emergency and temporary housing for those affected by flood damage."" She said eight households were still in emergency accommodation following the flooding and that financial aid was available for residents and businesses through the council.

Then the floods. In the small village of Sesklo in central Greece, 46-year-old Vasilis Tsiamitas has felt the extremes of both freak weather phenomena this summer, as Greece has become a climate change hotspot. Storm Elias flooded his house, damaged his beach bar and swept away his car in September. That finished off what was left weeks earlier by Storm Daniel, Greece’s most intense on record, and a July wildfire that scorched his family’s almond grove. “God only knows how I will get past this,” said Tsiamitas, standing outside his two-storey family house. The front door is off its hinges, propped up against a wall next to wooden boards soaked by floodwater. “What else could hit me? It can’t get any worse,” he said. Fierce storms and floods have become more frequent in recent years, while rising temperatures make summers hotter and drier, creating tinder-box conditions for wildfires. Muddy roads and household furniture, stacked up outside to dry, in villages across the central mainland region of Thessaly are a constant reminder of the steps Greece needs to take as it adapts to climate change and seeks to mitigate the effects of such freak weather events. Sesklo, a village of about 800 residents near the port city of Volos, and home to one of Europe’s oldest prehistoric settlements, has survived natural disasters through the centuries. But its oldest residents, Tsiamitas says, have never experienced anything like this year’s devastation. “It’s the first time that our village is tested so much,” said Tsiamitas, who is also the local community leader. “We have elderly people sitting at the village square who are 95 years old. They have never experienced such a thing before.” The wildfire that broke out in July was burning uncontrolled for at least two days. Sesklo residents were evacuated in time but the flames, fanned by strong winds, burned through farmland and groves, destroying approximately 70 percent of the village’s almond and olive oil production, said Tsiamitas. “The weather conditions were so bad, the wind, there was no humidity that day, the fire was moving fast. There was not enough time to do anything,” he said. In early September, Storm Daniel hit Thessaly after Greece’s longest heatwave in more than 30 years. It killed 16 people and turned the area into an inland sea, destroying homes, farms and wiping out swaths of crops. Tsiamitas, whose beach bar flooded, said most Sesklo residents were not as badly affected as others in the wider region. But their feeling of relief was short-lived. Weeks later, Elias, a less intense but unexpected storm, was the final straw. Tsiamitas recounts that he had his youngest son in his arms when a raging torrent flung his front door open, forcing him to race upstairs where his in-laws live. Since then, the water has subsided, revealing the devastation that villages like Sesklo suffered. “We should learn our lesson,” Tsiamitas said, looking at stumps of burned almond trees. “We need to uproot them … we need to plant them again. Again and again, we need to start everything from scratch.” Follow Al Jazeera English:"

The Thanksgiving travel period is expected to be the busiest in several years withmore than 55 million peopletaking to the roads and skies, according to AAA. This comes as a strong storm system is pushing its way across the eastern US, threatening to disrupt holiday plans with severe thunderstorms, drenching rain and snow. Meteorologists say major travel hubs from Atlanta to New York City arecontending with adverse weatherduring two of the busiest days of the year, meaning likely delays (and subsequent long-line rage). But there is still room for optimism. The storm’s impacts are forecast to subside later today as ittracks off the East Coast, leaving much of the central and eastern US to enjoy a dry Thanksgiving. Israel and Hamas on Tuesday reached a breakthrough deal for the release of hostages seized by Hamas in exchange for a pause in fighting in Gaza. The agreement would see therelease of at least 50 hostages— women and children — in exchange for a four-day truce in Israel’s air and ground campaign. The truce, meanwhile, would also allow the entry of “a larger number of humanitarian convoys and relief aid,” according to a statement from Qatar, a key negotiator of the deal. The announcement has been greeted with relief and heightened anticipation from the families of those taken hostage, who now await further news about their loved ones. Hamas is holding239 hostages captive in Gaza, including foreign nationals from 26 countries, the Israeli military said. Sam Altman has agreed toreturn to OpenAI, the company said Wednesday in a post on X, just days after he was ousted as CEO of the leading artificial intelligence company. The announcement appears to bring an end to several days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI — the company behind ChatGPT — and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. It also comes after hundreds of OpenAI employees — nearly the company’s entire staff — threatened to leave,potentially for Microsoft, if the company’s board didn’t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. At least three people were found dead and multiple others are believed to be missing after alarge landslide covered a highwaynear a remote community in southeast Alaska, the state’s Department of Public Safety said Tuesday. The landslide on the Zimovia Highway near Wrangell walloped three homes in its path and created a wide debris field, local officials said. A young girl was found dead during initial search and rescue efforts, and the remains of two adults were located by a drone operator and recovered, according to the department. State troopers are leading search and rescue efforts as three other individuals remain unaccounted for. North Korea claimed earlier today it had put its first spy satellite into orbit. Analysts said if the spacecraft works, it could significantly improve North Korea’s military capabilities, including enabling it to more accurately target opponents’ forces. Neither South Korea, the US nor Japan — all of which are experiencing increasing military tensions with North Korea — could confirm thesatellite had made it into orbit. But officials say the rocket carrying the satellite was launched in a southerly direction and is believed to have passed over Japan’s Okinawa prefecture. South Korea called the launch a “clear violation” of a UN Security Council resolution that prohibitsNorth Koreafrom using ballistic missile technology and vowed to investigate further.

A new study published in the journalNature Communicationsshows that accounting for the long-term impacts of these storms raises the global social cost of carbon by more than 20%, compared to the estimates currently used for policy evaluations. This increase is mainly driven by the projected rise of tropical cyclone damages to the major economies of India, the U.S., China, Taiwan, and Japan under global warming.""Intense tropical cyclones have the power to slow down the economic development of a country for more than a decade, our analysis shows. Withglobal warming, the share of the most intense tropical cyclones is expected to increase so it becomes more likely that economies may not be able to recover fully in between storms,"" explains Hazem Krichene, author and scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) at the time the research was conducted.That is why long-term implications like reductions ineconomic growthcaused bytropical cyclonesmay harm economic development even stronger than the direct economic damage of the storms.The so-called social cost ofcarbonis a dollar estimate for future costs of societies resulting from the emission of one additional ton of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This key metric is widely used in policy evaluations, as it allows comparing the costs of climate change for societies with the costs of climate mitigation measures.""However, long-term effects of extreme events are not taken into account so far, so that current social cost of carbon estimates only reflect a part of the actual costs. This means that the real costs are probably even higher than currently estimated and the benefits of climate mitigation consequently underestimated,"" co-author Franziska Piontek from PIK says.Hotter climate, more intense tropical cyclones, higher costsFor their study the researchers analyzed the economic damages caused by these storms in 41 tropical-cyclone prone countries over the period from 1981 to 2015 and projected them for future global warming scenarios. In contrast to previous studies they thereby accounted for the mostly negative long-term impacts of these storms oneconomic development.The researchers found that these impacts increase the social cost of carbon by more than 20% globally (from 173 US$ to 212 US$ per ton CO2) and by more than 40% in the analyzed tropical-cycloneprone countries—compared to the social cost of carbon estimates currently used for policy evaluations.""When it comes toextreme events, much focus is put on immediate economic damages. However, it is as crucial to better quantify the overall costs of these events to inform societies upon the real costs of climate change and the climate impacts that can be avoided by effective climate action,"" concludes study author Christian Otto from PIK."

Design is a big differentiator for the brand, with all of its products featuring a see-through aesthetic. That was the case with the ICEMAG magnetic power bank as well, and that's true of Sharge's latest product, the Disk. The Sharge Disk is an external SSD enclosure designed for M.2 2230 drives. While these drives aren't as prevalent as M.2 2280 options, they're slowly gaining traction thanks to handheld devices like the Steam Deck. The difference is that the M.2 2230 drives are shorter; the last two numbers in the designation refer to the length, so in this instance, the numbers correlate to drives that are 30mm long. By contrast, M.2 2280 drives are 80mm long. Sharge sells the Disk as an SSD enclosure, and it is now available on Amazon for $49. For that price, you get the Sharge Disk along with a silicone case — you can choose between yellow and grey — and a USB-C to USB-C cable. The biggest selling point of the Disk is the size; it is tiny, and doesn't take up much room at all. It has dimensions of 53.4 x 39.8 x 16.7mm, and the enclosure weighs just 14.5g (24g with the case). In fact, it's quite easy to lose, and the bundled case gives it some much-needed bulk — and visibility. Like other Sharge products, the Disk has a see-through design; one half of the enclosure has an acrylic window that lets gives you a good look at the SSD that's housed within. The other side is arguably the biggest differentiator for the Disk, as this is where a fan is located. The fan does a good job ensuring the SSD doesn't overheat — which is a routine enough occurrence — and it kicks into action whenever the drive is active. Sharge touts a 20-degree differential when the fan is active, and while I didn't see notice that much of a gulf, active cooling does make a difference. There are tiny vents on the side that serve as the exhaust, and while the fan is audible when the drive is in use, it isn't loud by any measure; when connected to my gaming rig, its noise was drowned out by the fans on my Corsair H150i Elite XT AIO cooler. The Disk has a USB-C port to one side that works over the USB 3.2 Gen 2 standard, and you get the full 10Gbps bandwidth. That's a good thing because that allows you to take full advantage of any M.2 SSD you slot into the Disk. On that note, I didn't have any M.2 2230 SSDs with me, so Sharge sent over a WD SN740 SSD with the enclosure. The 1TB drive has a 64MB cache, interfaces over PCIe 4.0 x4, and uses SanDisk's 112-layer TLC NAND flash memory. The drive itself is immaterial as you'll need to get your own — this particular WD variant is sold as an OEM model, so it isn't available to consumers — and if you're eyeing the Sharge Disk, I'd suggest buying Micron's 2TB 2400 M.2 2230 drive that costs just $156. Installing the drive in the Sharge Disk is about as straightforward as it gets. The acrylic cover slides off easily, and you can just slot in the drive and secure the fastener — the tool-free installation definitely makes things easy. The Sharge Disk enclosure is made out of metal, and it touts IP54 dust and water resistance (when used with the case), and you get a nifty write protection feature that essentially lets you lock the drive. There's also a 6.56-ft drop-proof rating, so the enclosure is clearly built to last. Because of the USB-C connectivity, you can use the Sharge Disk with just about any device. I connected it to my Windows machine, a host of phones, including the Pixel 8 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and also tested it with the Steam Deck. What's nifty about using it with the Steam Deck is that it serves as an external drive that boosts the storage of the console, but the downside is that you don't have access to the USB-C charging port while it's in use. Overall, the Sharge Disk has been terrific in daily use. It worked reliably across a wide variety of devices, and the WD SN740 was just as fast as full-length M.2 2280 drives. You're looking at just over $200 for the enclosure and a 2TB drive, and while you can get 4TB portable SSDs such as the Crucial X9 Pro for around the same price, the upside with the Sharge Disk is that you get much more versatility, and better performance. So if you're looking for an enclosure that lets you slot in an M.2 2230 drive, the Sharge Disk is an easy recommendation. The Sharge Disk is an M.2 2230 SSD enclosure with a difference. It has a rugged design, works with virtually all devices that have a USB-C port, and the fan at the back does a great job ensuring the SSD stays cool."

Jo Farrell was driven about 120 miles from Edinburgh to Northumberland during Storm Babet on 20 October. She had started in the role of Scotland's top police officer just 11 days earlier having previously been chief constable of Durham Constabulary. Ms Farrell said she was sorry for her ""error of judgement"". In a statement, the chief constable said: ""I requested my office to arrange for a car to drive me home to the Northumberland area after work. ""I was unable to complete the journey by train as services had been cancelled and my own police vehicle was unavailable. ""I have apologised for this error of judgement."" A civilian worker from Durham Constabulary was also a passenger in the police car. Police Scotland have confirmed this person was dropped off a further 15 miles south, in Gateshead. A Durham Constabulary spokesman said: ""Senior officers and staff from Durham Constabulary routinely visit other forces to help with advice and share best practice with colleagues across policing, both on a formal and informal basis. ""In this instance, an experienced member of staff attended Police Scotland to advise the chief constable about finances and resources."" The police driver, a road policing officer, was then said to have returned to Edinburgh - a round trip that would have taken about six hours. Much of Scotland was under severe weather warnings at the time as the country was battered by heavy rain and strong winds during Storm Babet. Train services, including LNER and Transpennine Express services which travel south of the border from Edinburgh Waverley, were cancelled due to the extreme weather conditions. Scottish Conservative shadow justice secretary Russell Findlay said: ""The new chief constable is tasked with making extremely difficult financial decisions due to SNP budget cuts, which makes her misuse of police resources even more jarring. ""There are many unknown details and unanswered questions, including what, if any, consideration was given to the safety of the officer who was ordered to complete this 250-mile round trip in dangerous weather conditions."" A spokesman for the Scottish Police Authority said: ""The authority is aware the chief constable used a police vehicle following the cancellation of a scheduled train journey. ""The chair has discussed this with the chief constable who has apologised. The authority considers the matter closed."" This is an embarrassing revelation for a chief constable who's kept a low profile since she took charge of the UK's second biggest police force. Once upon a time, Jo Farrell could have expected a lift home under such circumstances without anyone making much of a fuss. But it's 2023, it was a Friday during a storm, and Police Scotland has been complaining about being under-funded and overstretched. Next week Jo Farrell will use her first public speech to argue for increased funding to ease the force's financial woes. Not a great time to have to apologise over an error of judgement involving police resources."

This year, record nesting was found in Florida and elsewhere despite growing concern about threats from climate change. In Florida, preliminary state statistics show more than 133,840 loggerhead turtle nests, breaking a record set in 2016. Same for green turtles, where the estimate of at least 76,500 nests is well above the previous mark set in 2017. High sea turtle nest numbers also have been reported in South Carolina, Alabama, North Carolina and Georgia, although not all set records like Florida, where Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, said the number of nests is remarkable this year. “We had more nests than we had ever seen before on our local beaches,” said Perrault, whose organization monitors Palm Beach County and broke a local record by 4,000 nests. “That's quite a bit of nesting.” There are seven species of sea turtles: loggerhead, green, leatherback, hawksbill, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley and flatback. All are considered either endangered or threatened. They come ashore on summer nights, digging pits in the sand and depositing dozens of eggs before covering them up and returning to the sea. Florida beaches are one of the most important hatcheries for loggerheads in the world. Only about one in 1,000 sea turtle hatchlings live to adulthood. They face myriad natural threats, including predators on land and in the ocean, disruptions to nests and failure to make it to the water after hatching. This year along one stretch of Florida's Gulf Coast where 75 nests had been counted, most were wiped out by the surge from Hurricane Idalia in August. “Unfortunately, the nests pre-Idalia were almost all lost due to the high tides and flooding on our barrier islands,” said Carly Oakley, senior turtle conservation biologist at Clearwater Marine Aquarium. Female turtles generally lay eggs in a three-year cycle, leading to up-and-down years of nests, she said. “The nesting process is very exhausting and, in this break, females regain the energy to do the process again,” Oakley said. Climate change has added to those challenges, reducing beaches as sea levels rise and causing more powerful tropical storms. Hotter air, water and sand and changes in the ocean currents turtles use to migrate also lower the odds of surviving, according to Oceana, an international conservation group. Sand temperatures play a major role in determining sea turtle sex. In general, warmer temperatures produce more female turtles, and sand temperatures are projected to increase dramatically around the world by 2100, according to researchers at Florida State University. “So the warmer the nest is, the more likely that nest is to produce females,” Perrault said. “Additionally, hatchlings that come out of warmer nests are much smaller and often slower.” A study led by FSU professor Mariana Fuentes that was published recently in the Global Change Biology journal found sea turtles will have to nest much later or much earlier than they currently do to cope with changing environmental conditions. Even that may not be enough for every species, said Fuentes, who works in FSU's Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science. Turtles have adapted to altered climates over millions of years, but today's rapid changes could happen too quickly for them to evolve, she said. “We have found that even if they do change the timing of their nesting, that's not going to be sufficient to maintain the temperatures of current nesting grounds,” Fuentes said. Sea turtle mothers already have to lumber out of the water to find a good spot to nest, which can be difficult in areas where humans have built seawalls. Some female turtles make several attempts, known as false crawls, before finding a suitable location. Racoons, coyotes and other predators raid the nests and hatchlings, once they dig their way out, have to crawl to the sea before being snatched up by birds and other animals. Electric lights can disorient them, causing turtles to head the wrong way on the beach instead of following light from the moon and stars. And when the lucky ones finally start swimming, hungry fish await. Michelle Pate, biologist at the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, said tens of thousands of hatchlings don’t make it to the water, even as nest numbers trend higher across much of the Southeast. “If we can't get hatchlings to emerge and make it to the ocean, then an increase in nest numbers doesn't help,” she said. The increase in turtle nests this year conceals an ominous future for the animals, Perrault said. “Yes, we’re seeing record numbers, but our hatchling production may not be that great,” he said. “And so in the future, 20 to 30 years from now, and these things come back to nest, we may not be seeing these record numbers that we’re seeing now.” ___ AP video journalist Cody Jackson contributed from Juno Beach, Florida."

Extreme heat, air pollution and the increasing spread of deadly infectious diseases are just some of the reasons why the World Health Organization has called climate change the single biggest health threat facing humanity. Global warming must be limited to the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees Celsius ""to avert catastrophic health impacts and prevent millions of climate change-related deaths"", according to the WHO. However, under current national carbon-cutting plans, the world is on track to warm up to 2.9C this century, the UN said this week. While no one will be completely safe from the effects of climate change, experts expect that most at risk will be children, women, the elderly, migrants and people in less developed countries which have emitted the least planet-warming greenhouse gases. On December 3, the COP28 negotiations in Dubai will host the first ""health day"" ever held at the climate negotiations. This year is widely expected to be the hottest on record. And as the world continues to warm, even more frequent and intense heatwaves are expected to follow. Heat is believed to have caused more than 70,000 deaths in Europe during summer last year, researchers said this week, revising the previous number up from 62,000. Worldwide, people were exposed to an average of 86 days of life-threatening temperatures last year, according to the Lancet Countdown report earlier this week. The number of people over 65 who died from heat rose by 85 percent from 1991-2000 to 2013-2022, it added. And by 2050, more than five times more people will die from the heat each year under a 2C warming scenario, the Lancet Countdown projected. More droughts will also drive rising hunger. Under the scenario of 2C warming by the end of the century, 520 million more people will experience moderate or severe food insecurity by 2050. Meanwhile, other extreme weather events such as storms, floods and fires will continue to threaten the health of people across the world. Almost 99 percent of the world's population breathes air that exceeds the WHO's guidelines for air pollution. Outdoor air pollution driven by fossil fuel emissions kills more than four million people every year, according to the WHO. It increases the risk of respiratory diseases, strokes, heart disease, lung cancer, diabetes and other health problems, posing a threat that has been compared to tobacco. The damage is caused partly by PM2.5 microparticles, which are mostly from fossil fuels. People breathe these tiny particles into their lungs, where they can then enter the bloodstream. While spikes in air pollution, such as extremes seen in India's capital New Delhi earlier this month, trigger respiratory problems and allergies, long-term exposure is believed to be even more harmful. However it is not all bad news. The Lancet Countdown report found that deaths from air pollution due to fossil fuels have fallen 16 percent since 2005, mostly due to efforts to reduce the impact of coal burning. The changing climate means that mosquitoes, birds and mammals will roam beyond their previous habitats, raising the threat that they could spread infectious diseases with them. Mosquito-borne diseases that pose a greater risk of spreading due to climate change include dengue, chikungunya, Zika, West Nile virus and malaria. The transmission potential for dengue alone will increase by 36 percent with 2C warming, the Lancet Countdown report warned. Storms and floods create stagnant water that are breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and also increase the risk of water-borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid and diarrhoea. Scientists also fear that mammals straying into new areas could share diseases with each other, potentially creating new viruses that could then jump over to humans. Worrying about the present and future of our warming planet has also provoked rising anxiety, depression and even post-traumatic stress -- particularly for people already struggling with these disorders, psychologists have warned. In the first 10 months of the year, people searched online for the term ""climate anxiety"" 27 times more than during the same period in 2017, according to data from Google Trends cited by the BBC this week."

According to Newsweek, Earth has also been significantly affected by the surge in activity from the sun and has been experiencing solar storms , with a strong possibility of another one occurring today, 26th November. Furthermore, according to NASA scientists, one of these coronal mass ejections may also be on a collision course with Earth. According to NASA data, in the eventuality of such a collision, when the CME hits Earth, it can cause a large geomagnetic storm , which could lead to a disturbance in the Earth's magnetic field and as well as the atmosphere by the solar plasma. As per the same report by Newsweek, the head of the Solar Physics group at Aberystwyth University in the UK, Huw Morgan said, ""When a large plasma storm erupts from the sun, and that storm carries a magnetic field which is oriented in an opposite direction to Earth's magnetic field, we have a 'perfect storm,' and a larger geomagnetic storm."" According to the research done by Spaceweather.com, a minor G1-class geomagnetic storm can occur late on November 25th, through to November 26th, as two CMEs are expected to graze the Earth's magnetic field. Both CMEs were hurled into space by magnetic filaments erupting from the sun earlier this week. '' Solar flares and CME are both caused by the sun through its magnetic field being twisted and stressed through motions in the sun,'' Daniel Brown, an associate professor in astronomy and science communication at Nottingham Trent University in the UK told Newsweek. What are CMEs and how can it impact Earth? According to researchers, a coronal mass ejection is a large expulsion of plasma and magnetic fields from the Sun's corona. The Sun's corona is the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere and it largely hidden by the Sun's surface. These coronal ejections can eject billions of tons of coronal material and carry an embedded magnetic field that is stronger than the background solar wind interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength. CMEs travel outward from the Sun at speeds ranging from slower than 250 kilometers per second (km/s) to as fast as near 3000 km/s. Concurrently, disturbances in Earth's magnetic field caused by solar emissions result in geomagnetic storms . These storms are categorized on a scale from G1 to G5, where G1 represents the least severe and occurs frequently, several times each month. While a G1 geomagnetic storm isn't anticipated to pose direct threats to life on Earth, its implications could impact power grids and the operational capacity of certain satellites, including disruptions to GPS systems and mobile devices.

The coastguard said a navy helicopter picked up one crew member from the RAPTOR cargo ship, who was taken to Lesbos General Hospital. ""He is in a state of shock"", coastguard spokesman Nikos Alexiou told AFP, without providing further details. The fate of the other 13 was not immediately clear. Five cargo ships, three coast guard vessels, air force and navy helicopters as well as a navy frigate joined the rescue effort. Authorities said the cargo ship, which was carrying 14 crew members and was loaded with salt, went down 4.5 nautical miles (8.3 kilometres) southwest of Lesbos, near the coast of Turkey, early Sunday. The 106-metre ship, built in 1984, had sailed from Dekheila, Egypt, heading for Istanbul. The Athens News Agency (ANA), quoting the vessel's operating company based in Lebanon, said the crew included 11 Egyptians, two Syrians and one Indian. According to the authorities, the ship first reported a mechanical failure at seven am local time (0500 GMT). At 8:20 am, the captain reported that the ship was listing, and activated the ""mayday"" distress signal before disappearing from the radar, Alexiou told AFP. According to ANA, the heavily-laden vessel was believed to have taken on water in the hold due to strong waves, causing it to list and sink. Ships remained docked across several parts of Greece over the weekend, with wind speeds reaching 9-10 on the Beaufort scale, or strong gale to storm force. An emergency weather warning by the Hellenic National Meteorological Service (EMY) was upgraded on Saturday from ""worsening weather"" to ""dangerous weather phenomena"", as Storm Oliver (also called Bettina) moved from the Adriatic Sea toward Greece. Earlier this month, a historic Greek warship was damaged by gale force winds after repeatedly hitting a dock. The country has been struck by repeated flooding over recent months after facing a series of storms. Central Greece was devastated in September by cataclysmic amounts of rain dumped by Storm Daniel, destroying crops and killing tens of thousands of farm animals across a wide area that is the heart of Greece's agricultural production."

At least four storm-related deaths have been reported by local media. Ukraine says 2,019 of its villages and towns have no power after snowstorms. The storm is also battering Moldova, Georgia and Bulgaria. In Russia's Black Sea port of Sochi, big waves have been seen battering the city's seafront. Footage has also emerged purportedly showing a three-storey building collapsing. Near the town of Anapa, also on the Russian Black Sea coast, a cargo vessel with 21 crew has run aground. In the capital Moscow, authorities had to deploy specialist machinery to clear the streets after heavy snowfall. In Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula - illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 - Moscow-installed officials reported flooding in coastal areas. Fallen trees and other debris were seen on the streets of several towns. About 800 exotic fish died when a historic museum-aquarium was destroyed by sea flooding in the port of Sevastopol, the museum director was quoted as saying by a local media outlet. A state of emergency is now in place in several municipalities in Crimea. Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior ministry, said the storm ""washed away trenches in occupied Crimea that the Russian army dug out on the beaches"". Russia's military has not commented on the claim. Meanwhile, Ukraine's DSNS emergency service said snowstorms and fierce winds were battering 16 regions of the country. It said 48 people, including children, had been evacuated from trapped vehicles in the worst-affected Odesa region in the south-west. As many as 840 vehicles had to be towed away as snow drifts reached more than two metres (6.6ft) in some places, the emergency service said. At least 1,370 cargo lorries are currently stuck. At least six people have suffered hypothermia. Traffic is currently blocked on 14 motorways. Ukraine's southern Mykolaiv region is also badly hit. More than 1,500 rescuers are now deployed across Ukraine in a massive clean-up operation. They are being helped by police, border guards and National Guard members. In the capital Kyiv, the country's largest flag - measuring 16x24m - had to be taken down from a 90m pole after it was damaged by fierce winds. City officials said the flag would be replaced and raised again. The extreme weather comes as reports say Russia is again preparing massive rocket and drone strikes on Ukraine's power grid and other critical infrastructure. Last autumn and winter, Moscow carried out waves of such deadly attacks, leaving millions of people across Ukraine without electricity and heating. Last Saturday, Russia launched its biggest drone strike on Kyiv since its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukrainian officials said. They said that 74 out of 75 of Shahed kamikaze drones were shot down around the capital. Are you in the area? If it is safe to do so, share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

You get instant access to all your favorite streaming services, plus Dolby Vision, Wi-Fi 6 support, and a free Alexa Voice Remote. The Fire TV Stick 4K is currently seeing a 50% discount during Amazon's Cyber Monday sale, plus you get six months of MGM Plus streaming for free. The OnePlus Nord N30 is one of the best cheap Android phones to come out this year, with a vibrant 120Hz display, ultra-efficient Snapdragon chip, and some pretty amazing camera tech for the price. It even has a headphone jack! With a starting retail price of $299.99, the Nord N30 was already quite cheap, but Best Buy's Cyber Monday sale just upped the ante by dropping 50% off the price of the phone, as long as you're willing to activate it through their site. If you'd prefer the unlocked version, you'll still save a nice $70 on your purchase, no strings attached. A tablet for $40? That price alone could justify the purchase of a Fire 7 Tablet during Amazon's Cyber Monday sale, but it helps that it's honestly a pretty good device when it comes down to it. Far from the most feature-packed or innovative Android tablet on the market, the Amazon Fire 7 nevertheless boasts a lightweight 7-inch display, expandable storage, and enough power to handle most day-to-day tasks without skipping a beat. It's a cheap tablet, but it's a good cheap tablet, and for $40, it's an absolute steal. Our resident wearable expert Michael Hicks once called the Garmin Forerunner 955 the ""best runner's watch, period"", and now you can grab one for the discounted price of $399.99 during Best Buy's Cyber Monday sale. This durable watch provides all of the health and fitness tracking data you could ever need, plus it comes with dozens of activity modes, accurate GPS support, and up to 15 days of battery life in smartwatch mode. This 25% discount on the Google Pixel 7a was one of the most publicized deals over the past Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend, but it deserves just one more mention for anyone who missed it. The Pixel 7a is one of our favorite Android phones of the year, balancing flagship-level software with a reasonable price tag and the best haptics in its class. With a starting price of $499, the Pixel 7a was already affordable, but this Cyber Monday discount has sent the price of the unlocked phone crashing down to just $374, which is the cheapest that it's ever been. Best Buy is even sweetening the deal by throwing three months of YouTube Premium for free. If you still have some money left over after all the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping, why not spend $80 on a smart TV? Insignia's 32-inch F20 Fire TV is still sitting with a 47% discount during Amazon's Cyber Monday sale, and that's an absolute steal. Sure, it's not the most feature-packed TV on the market, but the F20 boasts a nice-looking HD screen, the Fire TV streaming platform, and a free Alexa Voice Remote. And again, it's 80 bucks. If you're looking to revamp your smart home ecosystem this holiday season, look no further than the Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen). This ""best on a budget"" smart display boasts a compact and versatile 5.5-inch touchscreen display, some decent-for-the-size speakers, and a crystal-clear 2MP camera for video calls and selfies, I guess. The compact size means this smart display won't interrupt your home's décor, but you'll still be able to manage your calendar, check the weather, and much more using simple Alexa voice commands. With a starting price of $90, the Echo Show 5 was already cheap, but Amazon's Cyber Monday sale is slashing an epic 56% off the price of the display, sending it crashing down to a mere $39.99. To be totally honest, I expected Black Friday to have a better showing of deals, with Cyber Monday merely offering the leftovers. Fortunately for all of us, Best Buy is subverting that expectation by slashing $700 off the Galaxy S22 Ultra when you activate the phone through their site. No trade-in required! For just $499.99, you're getting one of the best phones released in 2022, coming complete with the powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, 8K video support, and a gorgeous 6.8-inch AMOLED display with a built-in S Pen stylus. If you choose not to activate the phone today, you'll still get a decent $120 off (although if that's the case, I'd go with this $900 S23 Ultra deal). The Sony WH-1000XM4 may not be the best wireless headphones on the market now that the XM5s have come along, but they're still outstanding headphones, with an elegant, ultra-comfortable design, customizable active noise cancellation, and up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. Thanks to Cyber Monday, they're also seeing a sweet 34% discount at Amazon, dropping these cans to a lowest-ever price. You can also grab these headphones for the same price at Best Buy's Cyber Monday sale. As much as we love Samsung's premium foldables and S23s, they're still expensive even at Cyber Monday prices. If you want to start with something affordable, look into the Galaxy A23 5G, currently 12% off for Cyber Monday. Our #2 pick for the best Android phones under $300, the A23 5G gives you a 120Hz display, 5,000mAh battery, a future Android 14 OS update, and the promise of four years of security updates through 2026. Its Snapdragon 695 chip will do its job better than some other budget options, too. Still, if you can afford it, the Galaxy A54 ($324, or $125 off) is a much more reliable and powerful phone for $60 more. We've highlighted a couple of Samsung's gaming monitors, but we don't want to neglect people who want a reliable 4K monitor for productivity. In this case, getting a 32-inch 4K display for under $300 is a pretty fantastic steal. Our colleagues at Windows Central rated the UJ59 as their best budget 4K monitor, praising the color accuracy, thin bezel, and support for FreeSync and G-Sync. The only question is whether you want to spend a few extra bucks for the curved version. Someone at Walmart corporate must have bought an overstock of Galaxy Watch 4 Classic watches at some point, because they've been selling the 46mm at a discount for months — though at $149, it's about as low as we've ever seen it, and it's just as stylish as ever. Even though the watch is ""old"" compared to the Watch 6 Classic — currently $349 — it's still due to receive Wear OS support through mid-2025. So you're essentially getting a stylish timepiece for less than half the price of a new Classic model, and the promise that it'll get Wear OS 5 and 6 down the line. It's about as close as you'll get to a budget Android watch that's still worth using! We once called it the ""perfect foldable"", and now you can save a whopping $700 on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 when you activate it through Verizon on the Best Buy website. That's obviously an incredible discount, and Galaxy fans are flocking in droves to take advantage of it, so check Best Buy's stock before you get too excited! If you don't want to activate right away, it appears the Best Buy is also selling the unlocked phone with a still-great $535 discount, but it's currently out of stock. It may not be the latest foldable phone from Samsung, but the Z Flip 4 nevertheless boasts the great Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 processor, a pair of vibrant 120Hz displays, and a unique, exceedingly pocketable design. Smart projectors aren't exactly our bread and butter, but Samsung's The Freestyle deserves a particular mention, especially when you pair it with a 25% discount during Amazon's Cyber Monday sale. This device lets you project content from your favorite streaming services on any surface in vibrant 1920x1080 resolution, plus you get access to a console-free Gaming Hub and immersive 360-degree sound. Although they aren't the best wireless earbuds on the market today, Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 earbuds deliver an impressively punchy and bass-heavy sound profile, active noise cancellation, and a comfortable fit. Still, I wouldn't necessarily recommend them unless they were paired with a great discount, which is fortunately the case during Amazon's Cyber Monday sale. Pick up a pair in Olive and you'll save a sweet 40% on your purchase. It's as simple as that! The Samsung Galaxy S22 may be a 2022 phone, but it still holds its own against the best devices around, pairing the efficiency of the still-great Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip with some solid camera tech and loads of software support. Verizon customers who add a new line with any 5G Unlimited plan and you'll get enough promo credits to make this flagship phone 100% free, no trade-in required. You'll have to choose between the Phantom Black and Bora Purple versions of the phone, however, as it appears that the other colors are out of stock at the moment. Smart TVs are often big purchases, and if you want the best that Samsung has to offer, then you'll typically have to pay thousands to get the entertainment powerhouse of your dreams. Fortunately, Cyber Monday is making things a little easier by slashing an incredible 27% off the feature-packed 65"" S95C Series Quantum HDR Smart TV. That's a discount of $900, plus you're getting an absolute beast of a TV, coming complete with Samsung's AI-powered Neural Quantum processor with 4K upscaling, immersive object tracking sound, and a game optimizer that delivers refresh rates of up to 144Hz. When you're spending thousands on a TV, every penny counts. There's nothing like a half price deal on Cyber Monday, so be sure to pick up this Slim S Pen case for your Galaxy Z Fold 5 and revel in the half-size design Samsung came up with. This clever case protects your Galaxy Z Fold 5 all while adding a handy S Pen to the back. Just click down the latch and release the pen when you're ready to write and pop the pen back into the case when you're done. It couldn't be easier, and we're pretty sure this case can't get any cheaper. New day, new deal, and this one's the best yet! Get $800 off a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 when you order from Best Buy and activate it today. That's by far the lowest price we've seen — the previous record being $1,299 at Amazon up until now. If you've got a Best Buy anywhere near you, you can walk out of the store in the next few minutes with the best foldable phone Samsung has ever made. Plus, getting it at nearly half price will make anyone feel good in a year when prices for everything never seem to stop climbing. You don't have to trade in anything to get this deal, either, but trading in always makes the price even lower. Who doesn't like that? If you're ready to finally invest in the ultra-powerful and innovative (not to mention expensive) Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5, now would be a good time to do it. Just in time for Cyber Monday, Samsung is offering a free storage boost to 512GB (a $120 value) plus up to $1,000 of trade-in credit when you send in an old or broken device. You can use the website's trade-in tool to see exactly how much you can save, but it looks like both the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Fold 4 will get you the max credit! If you don't have anything to trade in, it's worth noting that Amazon is also slashing an excellent $500 off the price of the unlocked 512GB model, no strings attached. If you're hoping to buy a new pair of wireless earbuds this holiday season, the Galaxy Buds FE are an awesome choice. These sleek buds just came out last month so they're packed with all of the latest Samsung audio technology, including active noise cancellation (unusual in this price range), three mics per bud, and up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. Grab a pair of these Fan Edition earbuds before the Cyber Monday festivities wrap up and you'll instantly save 30% on your purchase. These specs for $70? That's a deal worth celebrating. The latest flagship phone from Samsung, the Galaxy S23 boasts the excellent Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor with a vibrant 120Hz display, great battery life, and all the comprehensive software support you could ever want in a device. It's not a dramatic upgrade over the S22, but in this case, that's a good thing. If it's not broke, why fix it? Grab an unlocked Galaxy S23 from Best Buy during their leftover Black Friday/early Cyber Monday sale and you'll get $100 off straightaway alongside four months of SiriusXM music streaming. Although it certainly lacks a lot of the bells and whistles found on other modern tablets, the Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is nevertheless a simple and reliable slab that boasts a durably metal frame, around 10 hours of battery life, and a decent MediaTek processor that should handle most casual tasks with ease. It's even better during Best Buy's early Cyber Monday sale, as a $60 discount is dropping the price down to just a Benjamin. To make the purchase an even more-appealing prospect, Best Buy is also throwing in six months of Webroot security software, a month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and three months of YouTube Premium for 100% free. Whether you're a data hoarder or not, nothing beats the convenience of having some extra storage for your devices. The problem is that what might seem like an incredible deal, ends up being far from it. So instead of worrying about buying some external storage from a company you've never heard of, stick with Samsung. The company makes some of my favorite portable SSDs, and all three of the latest iterations are on sale for Cyber Monday. Hands-down, the best deal comes from Best Buy, as you can get the Samsung T7 with 2TB of storage for $80 off! If you compare that to the T7 Shield Cyber Monday Samsung deal, then $20 extra dollars will get you double the storage. When it comes to computing beyond phones and tablets, we usually leave the heavy lifting to our friends over at Windows Central. But Samsung's Galaxy Book 3 lineup managed to pique our interest to the point that Nick actually reviewed the Book 3 Ultra, giving it a 4/5 star rating. So, now's a great time to check out a new laptop, and you can get Samsung's latest offering for as low as $699. The different Black Friday and Cyber Monday Samsung deals are for the base configurations, so you'll want to make sure you're picking the right one. But if you've already picked up a new Samsung phone and want to build out the perfect ecosystem, the next step is grabbing one of Samsung's laptops. Supercharge your PS5 this year with a Samsung 990 Pro SSD. I called it the perfect PS5 SSD in my Samsung 990 Pro review and that claim still holds up a year later. No matter what size you get, the 990 Pro is faster than the built-in PS5 storage and gives you even more room for great games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Spider-Man 2, Lies of P, Hogwarts Legacy, or anything else you might get this Holiday season. Personally, I don't think the model with the heatsink is necessary but you can opt to spend a few extra bucks if you're really concerned about overheating. The heatsink on the SSD will provide extra cooling power, keeping your storage nice and cool and performance as high as possible. These M.2 SSDs also work in most modern computers, so you don't have to just buy one for your PS5. Samsung has some seriously incredible deals for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but you can only get the very best ones when you order more than one thing at a time from the company. Case in point, when you bundle a pair of Galaxy Buds 2 Pro with your purchase, they will only cost $50! That's a mind-blowing price for the best earbuds money can buy. Likewise, Samsung's brand-new Galaxy Watch 6 series goes as low as $100 when you buy one alongside another Samsung product. To activate these deals, head on over to Samsung's deals hub, find the new phone or tablet you're looking to buy, and scroll down to the ""Limited time bundle offers"" section and select the bundle you want. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 takes the best flip phone concepts of the 2000s and combines them with the smarts and elegant design of a modern Samsung Galaxy. The Flip 5 improves upon prior Z Flip models with a hinge that folds flat, a substantially larger cover screen that you can use full apps on, and better battery life and performance than ever. Plus, there's no underestimating how well Samsung's ecosystem of products works with each other. When you have a pair of Galaxy Buds 2 Pro in your ears, for instance, you can record incredible quality spatial audio, giving you 3D audio playback when replaying your videos. And a Galaxy Watch will let you easily snap a picture from far away. That's particularly handy with a phone like the Galaxy Z Flip that can act as its own tripod because of the brilliant hinge design. The S95C is Samsung's best OLED TV to date, and it combines an outstanding panel with all the smart features that Samsung has to offer. The TV does an incredible job with HDR content, and Samsung uses what it calls a Neural Quantum Processor that automatically optimizes the colors and boosts the resolution. Look, this TV is overkill, but if you want the latest OLED TV from Samsung, the S95C is the way to go. If you don't need the ultra-thin design but are looking to get the latest OLED tech, you may want to consider the S90C; that particular TV costs $1,599 for the 65-inch variant — a full $1,000 off its retail price. Need other sizes? Head to Samsung's S95C/S90C listing page to see all the models on sale at the moment. Samsung launched the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Tab S9 FE+ without much fanfare a few months ago. The newly-released Galaxy Tab S9 FE boasts IP68 water and dust-proofing and comes with an S Pen just like the upper tier of the Tab S9 family of tablets, which is incredible given the price margin of the tablet. Cyber Monday and Black Friday sales are in full swing, bringing the Tab S9 FE's $450 price tag crashing down to a pleasing $399. That's a great bargain for less than $400, getting you a 10.9-inch 90Hz LCD screen, a gigantic 8,000mAh battery with 45W USB-C fast charging, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage that can be expanded up to 1TB via microSD, and the Exynos 1380 processor. The newer Tab S9 series may be out, but don't disregard the incredible Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra just yet. This powerhouse of a device boats some insanely beefed-up internals. The 120Hz 14.6-inch AMOLED display is an absolute delight to use and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 paired with 8GB of RAM is more than powerful enough to multitask. This Black Friday, Samsung has had its way with the Tab S8 Ultra's exorbitant price tag, bringing it crashing down to a lowly $699.99. If you need a decent tablet below $1,000, this is the best buy to make right now. The Odyssey 49 is the definition of an overkill gaming monitor — everything about this thing is extreme. You get a 49-inch curved QLED panel with a QHD resolution of 5120 x 1440, and it goes up to a 240Hz refresh. It works with NVIDIA G-SYNC and FreeSync Premium Pro, and if you've got a high-end card like the RTX 4090, this is the ideal monitor pairing. The Odyssey 49 is down to the same $899 at Samsung as well if you prefer buying straight from the manufacturer. Black Friday may be coming to an end, but the deals are far from over. If you're still trying to find a smart TV ahead of the holidays, Best Buy is currently slashing $170 off the 70-inch Class TU790T smart TV, an entertainment powerhouse that boasts Samsung's Crystal Processor with 4K upscaling, Adaptive Sound, and HDR support. As a Tizen TV, you also get instant access to all your favorite streaming services straight out of the box. We've yet to test out the Galaxy SmartTag 2 for ourselves, but we know it lasts twice as long (500 days) as the first-gen tags while adding Ultra Wideband for better precision finding in close proximity to your lost keys, as well as Bluetooth. We were fans of the original SmartTag+, however; so long as you're well-invested in the Samsung ecosystem, with a Samsung phone and familiarity with SmartThings, then you'll appreciate the SmartTag 2. This QHD, 240Hz gaming monitor is a fantastic option, with its support for G-Sync and FreeSync and a mere 1ms response time. Visually, it has HDR 600 support and 125% sRGB colors, so it'll look great for everyday browsing as well as gaming. The only real problem with it is that most people don't want to spend $800 for a monitor if they can help it; at $499, it's more reasonably priced for folks wanting to upgrade their at-home work/ gaming setup. Why buy the Watch 5 Pro when the Watch 6 Classic 47mm is the same price for Black Friday? Our Watch 6 Classic vs. Watch 5 Pro guide goes in-depth to explain, but there's one main reason: the Watch 5 Pro gives you an 80-hour battery life, while the Classic barely hits 40. The Pro's longevity is a real boon compared to Samsung's other watches, not to mention its titanium frame making it slightly lighter than the Classic. We still consider the Watch 5 Pro one of the best Android watches on the market, and because it's made by Samsung, it should get a few more years of support (justifying buying one new a year later). Don't be fooled by the low number: the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2022) was rereleased last year with a new processor, while preserving the same stylish design that made it so attractive in 2019. It's the same 10-inch size as the Galaxy Tab A8 (2022), but it comes with an S Pen, its aspect ratio is slightly taller, and the Snapdragon 720G chip gives you better performance than the Tab A8's Unisoc T618 chip. It's still affordable, slightly pricier than a Fire tablet but much more likely to receive software support and security updates for years to come. This is a solid deal for Android tablet fans! We wrote earlier about the QN85C ($500 off) and why it's a great deal, but it's admittedly only the entry-level option for Samsung's 2023 mini-LED TVs. If you want a slight upgrade without ranging into the $2,000+ zone, the QN90C is a fantastic compromise at $600 off. Our friends at Techradar already broke down the QN90C vs. QN85C for you; essentially, you get higher brightness, better anti-glare protection, and wider viewing angles, making it a better option if it's a family room TV meant to be watches from all sides. Otherwise, they have similar features and 4K 120Hz quality, so if you're mainly going to watch your new TV from the front, maybe save the extra $400 and buy the $1,000 QN85C instead! What's this? Oh, just the stylish Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, one of our highest-rated Wear OS watches of the year, for 20% off and the lowest price we've seen since its August launch? Oh, no big deal, just another Black Friday steal for our list. Joking aside, this is a genuinely good price. The Classic has a stylish edge over most other Android smartwatches besides the Pixel Watch 2 (which is still full price and doesn't have the Classic's ruggedness or rotating bezel). Looks aside, though, it's fast, has a thin border to maximize the display space, and it'll get four years of updates like every other Samsung product, so you're getting your money's worth. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Plus is the perfect balance between premium specs and a (relatively) reasonable price tag, boasting the excellent Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, a vibrant 12.4-inch 120Hz display, and an included S Pen stylus. Grab the S9 Plus from Amazon during the Black Friday sale and you'll get a storage boost to 512GB alongside a $100 gift card. That's $220 worth of savings, no strings attached. The Galaxy Tab A8 is not the most innovative or feature-packed tablet in the world, but it's a decent device with a durable metal construction, great battery life, and enough power to handle most casual tasks with ease. The Tab A8 becomes an even more enticing prospect when you pair it with a massive 43% discount at Amazon's Black Friday sale. If you have a tablet on your holiday wish list and you're looking for bang for the buck, you've found it. The Galaxy A54 was one of the better cheap Android phones of the year, pairing a stunning AMOLED display with a large 5,000mAh battery and decent specs under the hood. Thanks to Best Buy's Black Friday sale, the already-affordable phone has become even cheaper with a sweet $125 discount. You might be able to get the price down even more if you have an old phone to trade in. We're over halfway through the Black Friday festivities, but the deals are still pouring in like there's no tomorrow. If you have an old working device to send in, Samsung is offering up to $800 of trade-in credit when you buy the Galaxy S23 Ultra, enough to send the price of the super-powerful phone crashing to just $399. Devices like the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and S22 Ultra will get you the max discount, while phones like the base model Galaxy S22 will get you a still-great $600 credit. Don't have a phone to trade in? It's worth noting that Best Buy and Amazon alike are both offering $300 straight discounts on the 256GB phone. In addition to phones, tablets, and wearables, Samsung also manufactures some of the best Android TVs in the business, and this Class QN85C model is no exception. Powered by the Neural Quantum Processor, this TV uses AI-powered 4K upscaling, Object Tracking Sound, and a 120Hz refresh rate to make everything you watch as immersive and lifelike as possible. Pick up the 55"" model during Samsung's Black Friday sale and you'll instantly save $500. If you need a bigger TV, the 65-inch, 75-inch, and 85-inch versions are also being discounted, with savings of up to $1,500 available. The Samsung Galaxy S23 Plus is all about balance, with a customized Snapdragon 8 Gen chipset, huge battery, and a long-term software update guarantee. Head to Best Buy before the Black Friday sale wraps up and you can grab the 256GB model for $799.99, which is the same price as the lesser base model Galaxy S23. Best Buy will even sweeten the deal by throwing in four months of SiriusXM streaming for free. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 has a lot of amazing things going for it, from the ultra-efficient Snapdragon chip to the durable hinge that helps the phone fold flat. One thing the holds the phone back is its price. With a starting price of $1,799.99, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 is way out of reach for most people, which is why we're excited to see Amazon slash a whopping 28% off the premium foldable. That's the biggest discount that the unlocked phone has ever received, so now's the time to buy (if you can afford it). MOVE FAST! This sale ends at 3PM Eastern/Noon Pacific time. While Dbrand has been in the news this Black Friday for something other than a sale, we'd like to specifically focus on the company's Black Friday deals for just a moment. DBrand has been making our favorite phone skins and cases for years, and this rare sale means you can get one of DBrand's excellent leather skins for 30% off, or BOGO for the newfangled X-Ray skins. As DBrand points out, getting a free X-Ray skin means you can get a dark and light mode version for your phone for the price of one, so you don't have to choose at checkout. Plus, you can outfit your PS5 with some fancy new colors thanks to 40% off DBrand Darkplates. These replace the plastic exterior of your PS5 with something more aesthetically pleasing, and they even have added ventilation for Sony's powerful next-gen console. You can even bring the 90s back with a transparent Darkplate! While you're shopping around for tech, don't forget to pick up gifts for everyone else in your life, too! Thanks to this Amazon gift card Black Friday sale, you can get 20% off gift cards for their favorite retailers like Bath & Body Works, Yankee Candle, Banana Republic, and Pink. Plus, gift cards for Lyft, Under Armour, Razer, Instacart, and even Apple are all on sale right now at Amazon. Heck, you can even make your kids' next birthday party cheap with Chuck E Cheese gift cards on sale, see a movie with discounted Cinemark gift cards, or get a new pair of kicks with a discounted DSW gift card! The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition takes the best Kindle from Amazon's lineup and makes it even better. This reading device lasts for weeks on a single charge, charges via USB-C and wirelessly, and boasts IPX8 water resistance. The Paperwhite Signature Edition also comes with 32GB of storage as standard, which is more than you'll ever need to store e-books and audiobooks. Everything about the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is likeable, but that gorgeous 6.8-inch 300 ppi Paperwhite display is easily its best feature. You get 17 LED front lights and a host of adjustable settings such as temperature, brightness, backlighting, and more. This is the optimal reading device for anyone. Who doesn't love transparent tech? Gadgets like the see-through Shargeek Storm 2 Slim allow us to take a peek at the incredible level of sophistication that goes on inside our gadgets. This slim 20,000mAh power bank usually costs an arm and a leg, but it's cheaper than ever with today's Black Friday deal. If you've been eyeing this power bank for a while, now's your chance. The Shargeek Storm 2 Slim is the stuff of every geek's dreams. It has an IPS LCD screen that displays all the charging details you could want and then some. There's a 100W PD USB-C port and a 30W USB-A port, adding up to a whopping 130W of power. At nearly $100 knocked off, this is an amazing bargain. The Marshall Emberton II is one of the best portable Bluetooth speakers around. It sounds super fine-tuned and packs plenty of power. This is surprising considering how small and compact the thing is. Leather meets metal in luxurious harmony, giving the Emberton II a timeless look of class. Usually, this waterproof Marshall speaker costs around $170, but the device is on sale for only $119.99 this Black Friday. It's a fantastic buy that you won't regret one bit. And if you've got the budget, why not grab two and use them in Stack Mode for stereo sound? UGREEN's Nexode 100W 2-in-1 Charger is a standard GaN charger that has three ports and goes up to 100W over the USB PD standard. But what gives this an edge is the MagSafe base that's built into the top, and that lets you charge your iPhone — or any Android phone with a MagSafe case — at 15W. The versatility makes this a great charger if you need wireless charging as well as 100W wired charging in a single product. If you want a phone with a distinctive design and great hardware, you should consider picking up the Nothing Phone (2). The see-through design at the back combined with LED lighting makes it stand out, and you get much more powerful hardware this time around, and interesting software with plenty of unique extras. The best part is that this variant comes with 256GB of storage as standard, so you are getting a good overall value here. Crucial's X9 Pro is one of the best portable SSDs you can get at the moment, and the 4TB model is down to just $182, making it a great bargain. The X9 Pro uses Micron's QLC flash memory, hits over 1000MB/s in reads and writes, and is ideal for use with your phone, notebook, or any other device that connects over USB-C. If you don't want to buy a 4TB drive, the X9 Pro is available in a 1TB version that's down to $59, and the 2TB model is now listed at $109. Status Audio isn't a brand you may have heard of, but its Between 3 ANC wireless earbuds go up against the best that this category has to offer — and come out on top. What makes the earbuds so good is a hybrid driver arrangement that delivers amazing bass and detailed highs. You also get all the extras that's standard in high-end earbuds; there's ANC, multi-device connectivity, IPX5 water resistance, and you can easily change the sound profile. The best part is that these last up to 7.5 hours on a full charge, and that's more than what you get from the best Samsung and Sony earbuds. Anker is one of our favorite brands when it comes to charging accessories. The Anker Nano Power Bank not only offers plenty of power in a small chassis, but it also comes with a built-in USB-C cord that doubles as a loop/handle, making it easy to carry around. And with the little display on the side, you'll always know how much charge you have left. For just $35, this is a steal for anyone who finds themselves constantly looking for a charger, especially since it charges pretty fast at 30W. That's also why it's one of the charging accessories we recommend buying on Black Friday. Amazon’s Fire HD 10 tablet is the perfect device for casually surfing the web or streaming your favorite content. Typically priced around $140, the Fire tablet was already pretty affordable, but now Amazon has upped the ante by slashing an epic 43% off the device, knocking it down to just 80 bucks for Black Friday. With the 2023 Fire HD 10, you’re getting a bright 10-inch 1080p HD screen, up to 13 hours of battery life, and 3GB of RAM with an octa-core CPU. For just $79.99, that’s a deal worth celebrating. This year has been pretty darn great if you're a fan of Chromebooks, but if you've been holding off and waiting for a good sale, now's your time to shine. Acer's Chromebook Spin 714 (2023) is easily one of the best Chromebooks, regardless of what your budget is. For Black Friday, Best Buy has our favorite deal as the Spin 714 (2023) has plummeted down to just $470. Even at the full retail price of $699, the Spin 714 is worth every penny, but the fact that you can save $230 is bonkers. With this Chromebook, you'll get the latest Intel 13th Gen Core i5-1335U, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and all of the new Chromebook Plus features. Airpods might be the household name because of the fruit logo, but that doesn't mean they're necessarily the best earbuds money can buy. Google makes an incredible pair of earbuds in the Pixel Buds Pro which feature excellent active noise cancelling, superb sound quality, Google Assistant built right in, and awesome new features that Google just launched. But if $120 is still too expensive for a new pair of earbuds, Google's Pixel Buds A-Series are half that price at $60 for Black Friday. The battery life isn't as good as the Pro model and the style looks a bit cheaper, but it's hard to argue with a great pair of wireless earbuds at this price. I've used a lot of gaming controllers over the years, and while there are plenty of ""good"" controllers that work with your smartphone, there's only one real ""great"" one. The GameSir X2 is my all-time favorite mobile gaming controller and it always goes on sale during Prime Day/Black Friday/etc. What makes these so good? Namely, the joysticks. These aren't those crappy Nintendo Switch-style short joysticks that are hard to aim properly with in games like Fortnite, Call of Duty, etc. These are legit joysticks that you can use to move and aim precisely in games because they're not only tall but they have adequate padding for your thumbs. I've also found that digital triggers work better than analog ones in a lot of mobile games. Minecraft, for instance, seems to think I want to place more than one block at a time when I squeeze the analog triggers on controllers like the Razer Kishi V2. That doesn't happen on the GameSir X2, and it all helps round out why I love these controllers. They come with a handy carrying case that you can slip a phone or portable battery in, and you can choose from USB-C or Bluetooth models for nearly the same price thanks to this sale. I love seeing good Holiday decorations, but I'm generally not a fan of taking the time to put them up and take them down every year. So what if I told you that you can put the Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights up once and leave them up all year? I thought it was too good to be true until I reviewed them last year. Because of that, I can have festive lights for every season thanks to the Govee app. It has unlimited possibilities, including dozens of easy presets and constantly added community styles. These LEDs can do just about anything you imagine, and they hold up all Summer and Winter since they're built so well. Govee has also recently debuted curtain lights and Christmas tree lights, both of which tie in to the same Govee app and can be synced with your outdoor lights. This year, I'll have the dopest Christmas Lights in the whole neighborhood, both on my house and on my tree, and you can, too, with these crazy Black Friday savings. What better time than Black Friday to upgrade your home theater setup? It all starts with a streaming device and Amazon's are some of the cheapest options around. Don't be fooled by the low prices, as these truly are some of the best streaming devices out there. Even Amazon's most powerful streaming device, the Fire TV Cube is on sale for $30 off. But, we'd probably lean towards the Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only because it's 50% and is quite a bit better than the other streaming sticks. This is a little different than the other offers on this list, but if you’re a Verizon customer (or you’re thinking about joining), it deserves a mention. Add a line to your wireless service with any 5G Unlimited plan and the carrier will hook you up with enough promo credits over 36 months to make the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE totally free. That’s a pretty good deal for a phone that just hit store shelves in late October. This isn’t a “straight” discount by any means, but it’s arguably the best deal that the Google Pixel 7 Pro has ever received. Bundle any six-month Mint Mobile plan with the purchase of the Pixel 7 Pro and the carrier will hook you up with $600 off AND six additional months of wireless service for 100% free. In other words, you could get the best Android phone of last year and a full year of T-Mobile-powered wireless coverage for as little as $33 per month. Not too shabby, if you ask us! Typically priced around $350, Beats Studio Pro headphones boast customizable spatial audio support, active noise cancellation with transparency mode, and up to 40 hours of battery life on a single charge. Just in time for Black Friday, Best Buy is dropping a straight 51% off these premium cans, sending the price crashing down to just $169.95. If that wasn’t enough, they’re also throwing some free streaming service subscriptions into the mix, including three months of Apple Music and three months of Apple TV Plus. If you need a new pair of wireless earbuds and sound quality is important to you, you should really consider the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. These buds boast active noise cancellation, Enhanced 360 spatial audio support, and the ability to fine-tune your own EQ settings. Perhaps best of all, they’re comfortable enough that you can listen all day long. Grab a pair of Galaxy Buds 2 Pro during Amazon’s Black Friday sale and they’ll hook you up with a historic 30% discount. They’ll also throw in a $10 gift card to help you out with your holiday shopping. The Samsung Galaxy A54 is one of our favorite cheap android phones of 2023, coming with a vivid 120Hz AMOLED display, long-lasting 5,000mAh battery, and years of software support guaranteed. It may not match the Pixel 7a in the camera department, but if you’re a Samsung fan, it’s one of the best sub-$500 options out there. Grab an unlocked A54 during Amazon’s Black Friday sale and you’ll save a sweet 28% on your purchase. That’s the biggest discount that this midrange phone has gotten yet, no strings attached. Google’s Pixel Tablet can handle just about any task you throw at it, and if you’re a fan of the Pixel experience, you might even consider it to be the best Android tablet that money can buy. Up until recently, discounts on the device were few and far between, but Best Buy’s Black Friday sale is finally carving a sweet $100 off the Google Pixel Tablet, making now the best time to buy. Your purchase also comes with the free charging speaker dock that transforms the tablet into a smart display, and Best Buy is throwing in three months of YouTube Premium streaming for free! To call Samsung’s The Frame series luxurious might be an understatement. These smart TVs pair top-of-the-line picture quality and fluid performance with a unique design that helps these TVs double as a work of art in your home. Just in time for Black Friday, Samsung is discounting a number of these artful 4K QLED TVs, with up to $1,000 of savings up for grabs. These are all the models on sale right now: The Pixel Watch is an excellent device inside and out, with a super-classy teardrop design, Wear OS software features, and all the health and fitness tracking technology you could ever need. Sure, you could go for the newer Pixel Watch 2, but the first-gen watch is almost just as good and it’s only $200 during Black Friday. Featuring a unique design inspired by the look of a black hole, the OnePlus 11 is clearly one of the most eye-catching flagship phones to drop this year, but it’s just as impressive under the hood. You get the ultra-efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, for one, plus a vibrant 120Hz AMOLED display and the best camera tech on any OnePlus phone to date. Head to Best Buy before the Black Friday sale is over and you can get an unlocked OnePlus 11 for as little as $549.99. That’s a $150 discount! Plus the retailer is sweetening the deal by throwing in three months of YouTube Premium for free. And if you need more storage, the 256GB model is down to $629 — savings of $170. The Echo Show 8 is already a great device for fans of the Alexa ecosystem, with an 8-inch HD touchscreen display, 13MP camera, and all the smart home controls you could ever ask for. Thanks to Amazon’s Black Friday sale, you can grab one of these smart displays (usually priced at $149.99) and a TP-Link smart light for a mere $104.99. That’s $67.99 of savings, and all you need to do is hit that Add to Cart button. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 may be the best Android smartwatch that money can buy, but that hasn’t stopped Best Buy from knocking a cool $70 off the price during their Black Friday sale. For just $260, you’re getting cutting-edge wearable technology with outstanding Wear OS software, advanced health and fitness tracking sensors, and up to 40 hours of battery life on a single charge. If you've been hunting for a smart TV this holiday season, you probably noticed that it's nearly impossible to find a 65-inch TV for less than $500, especially one that supports 4K UHD picture. This Black Friday deal from Walmart changes all that. For a mere $228, you're getting outstanding picture with 4K upscaling, HDR support, and of course, instant access to all of your favorite streaming services (plus a lot of free stuff!) thanks to the Roku TV platform. We've said it before and we'll say it again: Acer's Chromebook Spin 714 offers the perfect balance of cost and performance, especially when you pair it with a $230 discount during Best Buy's Black Friday sale. You get the 360-degree hinge that lets you turn the laptop into a tablet, plus a 13th Gen Intel Core processor, durable military-grade construction, and up to 10 hours of battery life on a single charge. Best Buy will even throw in a free protective sleeve and three months of YouTube Premium for free. Stylish and versatile, the Fossil Gen 6 boasts an efficient Qualcomm chip, loads of activity-tracking features, and great battery life with super-fast charging. It's a few years old at this point, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, as you can currently grab this watch for just $170 during Amazon's Black Friday sale. That's not a record low price for the watch, but it's pretty darn close. Why not kick things off with the most powerful Android phone on the market? The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra boasts a built-in stylus, a gorgeous 6.8-inch AMOLED display, and the power of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor. Grab one of these beasts of performance at Best Buy and you'll save a record-smashing $300 on your purchase. As the biggest drawback of the S23 Ultra has always been its prohibitive price, this Black Friday discount is a big deal."

More than half a million people are without power in occupied-Crimea, Russia and Ukraine after a storm in the Black Sea region flooded roads, ripped up trees and took down power lines, according to Russian state media and Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy. More than 2,000 towns and villages were without electricity on Sunday night and Monday morning in 16 Ukrainian regions, including Odesa, Mykolaiv and inland in Kyiv, as trees were uprooted, power lines snapped and electrical substations failed, leaving almost 150,000 households in the area without electricity, Ukraine’s Energy Ministry said. A 110-metre (360ft) chimney of a heat and power plant collapsed in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Sunday night, adding to Ukraine’s losses of energy infrastructure that have already sustained heavy damage from Moscow’s militarycampaign targeting Ukraine’s power grid. As winter nears, Russia has been attackingcivilian infrastructurefar from the front lines, leaving millions of Ukrainians without power, heat and water for days at a time. Although the heating supply has been restored after plants in Odesa were shut down for several hours due to power fluctuations, Ukrainian officials said they expected the weather to worsen as forecasters predicted more strong winds and snowfall. The head of Russia’s national meteorological service said the storm that hit Crimea was the most powerful since record-keeping began, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. At least three people were killed during the storm, local media reported. One person was killed in the resort city of Sochi, another on the Russian-held Crimean Peninsula and a third person on board a vessel in the Kerch Strait, which separates Crimea from the Russian mainland, the state news agency TASS reported. Russia’s Ministry of Energy said “about 1.9 million people” were affected by power cuts in the southern Russian regions of Dagestan, Krasnodar and Rostov as well as the occupied Ukrainian territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhia and Crimea. Crimea’s Moscow-appointed governor declared a state of emergency, and hundreds of people were evacuated. A video published online showed large waves sweeping over the seafront in Sochi and carrying away cars. In the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, an aquarium flooded and nearly 800 exotic fish, including pikes and piranhas, died from thermal shock as cold seawater flooded the facility, the aquarium director said. Roman Vilfand, the head of Russia’s national meteorological service, said a similar storm hit the region in November 1854 during the Crimean War. It caused at least 30 ships to sink off Crimea’s coast, RIA Novosti said. In southern Russia, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium stopped crude oil loading at the Novorossiysk port on Monday due to “extremely unfavorable weather conditions”, including winds of up to 86 kilometres per hour (54 miles per hour) and waves up to 8 metres (26ft) high. In the port city of Anapa, a cargo ship ran aground. Follow Al Jazeera English:"

The last time such a storm occurred was more than 160 years ago, Vilfand added. The meteorologist said that wind speed had reached 40 meters per second (144kph). At least one person died overnight and ten people have sustained injuries in the disaster, according to the regional authorities. A total of 400,000 people in Crimea were left without electricity in the wake of the storm, and several local municipal districts declared a state of emergency. Videos shared on social media show huge waves hitting Crimean shores and city embankments, including at Sevastopol. Houses and highways were flooded with sea water, while other areas of the peninsula faced snowstorms. Crimea was not the only area hit by the disaster. In Russia’s Krasnodar Region, which includes a long stretch of the eastern Black Sea coast, the storm damaged buildings and led to flooding, videos taken by locals and tourists show. Footage captured waves hitting a power line near a railway. In another clip taken from a moving train, a railway line running close to the shore collapses because of the storm. Around 50 trains were delayed due to damage sustained by the line, RIA Novosti reported. Other videos show a one-story building collapsing due to gusty winds in the southern Russian city of Sochi. At least one person died in the city because of the storm, which has largely moved on from the area, Russian media reported."

The motoring group has had over half a million call-outs for the year so far - a daily average of more than 1,500. ""Continuous poor weather"" and recent storms such as Babet, Ciaran and Debi have contributed to poor road surfaces. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged more than £8bn in funding last month to tackle what he called the ""scourge of potholes"". RAC analysis of garage repair data estimates that drivers are paying an average of £440 if their car needs fixing after hitting a pothole for any damage more serious than a puncture. Common vehicle problems caused include distorted wheels, damaged shock absorbers and broken suspension springs. Potholes are often caused by water entering cracks in the road surface. The constant freezing and thawing of water in icy winter weather weakens the structure of the road and material eventually comes loose - causing the holes. Tony Rich of the AA said ""continuous poor weather"" and recent storms, such as Babet, Ciaran and Debi, were having a ""two-fold effect on driving conditions"". He said: ""What feels like relentless rainwater is covering and increasing the severity of potholes, while also holding back essential road repairs by rightly diverting roads maintenance crews to tackle fallen trees and flooded areas. ""Our advice to drivers and those on two wheels is to avoid puddles where safe to do so, but if there is no alternative other than to travel through, then reduce your speed and keep an increased distance from the vehicle in front."" The AA received 52,541 call-outs last month for vehicles damaged by road defects - a 12% increase on October last year. It also beats the previous record set in the same month in 2017 by 389 call-outs. In October, the PM highlighted the reallocation of funding towards pothole repairs as part of plans to scrap part of the HS2 high-speed rail line and spend the savings on other projects. Councils have said the cost of repairing local roads is around £14bn, roughly £6bn more than Mr Sunak announced. Darren Rodwell of the Local Government Association said the new funding ""will help with bringing more of our local road network up to scratch, including reinstating repairs for potholes that had been impacted by inflation."" In the longer term, he said the government should award council transport departments with five-yearly funding allocations ""so they can develop resurfacing programmes and other highways improvements"". A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We are already investing more than £5.5 billion into highways maintenance, and our recent Network North announcement delivers an additional £8.3 billion, the biggest-ever increase in funding for local road improvements, and enough to resurface up to 5,000 miles of roads."""

Today, solar storms, orgeomagnetic storms, are recorded on average by magnetometers spaced about 400 km apart.Solar storm effects are caused by fast solar wind streams, which cause large electric currents to flow through the ionosphere of the Earth's auroral region, but the behavior of these currents during storms is still not fully understood. Solar storms also appear as auroras.Researchers from the Sodankylä Geophysical Observatory (SGO) and the Ionospheric Physics Group at the University of Oulu, Finland studied the local magnetic field perturbations in the auroral region during space storms usinghistorical data.Large regional differences in the effects of solar stormsThe new study looked at data from a strong solar storm in December 1977 from all 32 stations of the then Scandinavian Magnetometer Array (SMA) network in the Nordic countries, which is denser than the current network, and largely unexplored.Studying the data was laborious, because in 1977, changes in the Earth's magnetic field were seen as fluctuations recorded by magnetometers on film strips. There were almost 40 kilometers of untouched, small film strips from nearly 50 years ago.It was hand-photographed frame by frame over several dozen meters for the new study, and the images were digitized. Using the digitized values and modern magnetic data, clear regional differences in solar storm intensity were found.""Usually today, we look at the whole of the Earth's auroral region as a single entity. However, we used more than 30 instruments to map the effects of a single solar storm from the Arctic Ocean to the Bothnian Sea,"" says Otto Kärhä, a doctoral researcher at the University of Oulu who also photographed much of the old films. He will present the new findings at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) San Fransisco Fall Meeting 2023 in December.The rarity of large geomagnetic storms limits their study, and local effects have historically left largely unstudied. The largest solar storm in recorded history was Carrington in 1859. Descriptions at the time showed the sun brightening and being dazzling even to closed eyes. The Carrington solar storm caused sparks on telegraph lines and fires. Today, the consequences of a magnetic storm of this magnitude would be devastating for power grids and telecommunications links, including satellites.In light of new research, local variations in a Carrington-class solar storm could be as high as 150 nT (nanotesla)/10 km. The difference is comparable to a small breeze in Muonio and a magnetic whirlwind 140 km away in Sodankylä.""When such a solar storm hits, too sparse magnetometer network could lead to underestimation of local magnetic disturbances and underestimation of the preparedness for them,"" says Professor Eija Tanskanen, Director of SGO.Large solar storm possible in the near future: Denser network to warn of local effectsScientists around the world are fairly unanimous that in the near future, a historically large solar storm may hit the Earth.""The variability in experts' estimates of its impact stems from the fact that the Earth's geomagnetic environment is still poorly understood, and solar storms cause very variable effects to the auroral currents. The current Intermagnet network has too few magnetometers in the polar region, most commonly at intervals of about 200–400 km, when it would be better to have them at 100 km intervals,"" says Tanskanen. The magnetometers are hosted by various research institutes and observatories.Historical data from the new study revealed magnetic field structures in the auroral belt that cannot be observed with the current network of instruments.""A densermagnetometernetwork would help to understand the complex structure of the magnetic field duringsolar storms. We could provide local warning of solarstormmovements, and better safeguard infrastructure vulnerable to magnetic disturbances. Air traffic, for example, could also be warned more regionally about strong magnetic clouds and storms,"" Tanskanen suggests."

This problem was previously a major contributor to the high cost of haulage. However, with the efforts made by the council, the issue is gradually becoming a thing of the past,ANOZIE EGOLEwritesPort access roads used to be known as centres of extortion as non-state actors milked trailer drivers who were trying to enter the port complexes. They were usually made to pay through their nose before they were able to gain access to the ports, especially in Lagos, the country’s maritime hub. Despite the complaints of the trailer operators, the extortion persisted. This is despite the rising costs of haulage occasioned by the hike in fuel prices.However, the appointment of Emmanuel Jime as the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Shippers Council in 2021 has changed the narrative. In the two years he was at the helm of affairs at the council, he battled the extortionists to a standstill. He had returned some sanity to the country port access roads.The address the issues of corruption along the ports’ corridor, the Ports Standing Task Team was constituted. The PSTT clamped down on non-state actors who were terrorising trailers heading into the port complexes. The team has been to reduce the menace of extortion along the ports’ corridor in the last two years, thereby, reducing haulage costs.Apart from successfully tackling the issue of extortion along the port access roads, Jime also ensured a friendlier working environment in the sector and promoted stakeholders’ engagement, though some people argued the agency still needed to step on this.When he was appointed in June 2021 to replace Hassan Bello, many industry operators were skeptical about his ability to fill the shoes of his predecessor at the NSC, being a former managing director of the Nigerian Export Processing Zones Authority, Jime was relatively unknown in the port industry.Fostered collaborationThe Managing Director of ENL Consortium, Mark Walsh, said “When I look at the situations on the ground, they have been working directly with terminal operators and shipping companies to try and move the industry forward. I think they have been involved much more with the terminal operators, they are also coming to check and monitor the terminal operators and they need to be commended.”A former National President of the Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents, Olayiwola Shittu, said the shippers council under Jime promoted stakeholders’ engagement in the industry.Shittu, who is also the Chief Executive Officer of Skelas Group, said, “The council has tried to reach out to stakeholders seeking cooperation. That is very scarce in our industry where there is stiff competition among leaders of government agencies, but the council’s leadership has tried to reach out to other agencies.“They have made us know that stakeholders can work together, but the handicap is the Act setting up NSC. There is just no power for enforcement; they are not given any teeth to do what they are supposed to do.“Those they are supposed to be regulating have the sympathy of their colleagues who do not want shippers council to survive, but the council has tried to weather the storm. We just hope that one day, either this government or another will let the shipper’s council function at its best and let us see whether it will drive the train.”Also assessing the council in the last two years, a former National President of the National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders, Eugene Nweke, said the activities of the council were obvious like that of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency and Nigerian Ports Authority.“So, you would not oftentimes see what shippers council is doing because it is not awarding contracts on waterways, port repairs, etc., but they are giving their all to safeguarding the industry.“The direction they are heading to in the industry is in line with their establishment law because of this specific role they play so that the shippers’ interest is taken care of,” he explained.According to Nweke, the commitment of the council has been beneficial to the maritime industry.“Their in-depth commitment to their role on behalf of the shippers, building everybody on business operation and agility in the industry, all leading toward producing a conducive environment for shippers and consumers and the other users of the industry services. That is the key role of shippers council is playing.“Look at this, they are trying to ensure that goods get to the shippers and encourage other shippers across other states to come on board and pursue common purpose,” Nweke said.Jime’s appointment was greeted with resistance by some members of the council. But it did not take him long to win over those who opposed his appointment. He had been able to convince them that he was fit for the job.Related NewsGovernorship Election Live UpdatesExtortion: Lagos drivers plan more protests, govt pledges fairnessAnambra policemen arrest suspects extorting residents with death threatsMotorists accuse police of using hoodlums for extortionAlthough the council is still struggling to take its place as the economic port regulator, under Jime, it had started to put structure in place that would enable it to carry out this function.For instance, the NSC has challenged the maritime command of the Nigerian Police Force over its involvement in cargo clearance processes in whatever guise as illegal and should be discontinued.The council had also made it clear to the Nigerian Ports Authority and Nigerian Inland Waterways Authority, that none had a direct duty to impose or determine costs of barging and evacuation of containerised cargoes from the port without its concurrent approval.Also, the council has taken very bold steps at reinventing the Ports Community Committee in such a manner as to be at par with the processes already established by the NPA which was formerly carrying out the assignment.There was also a growing call for sensitisation and advocacy on the council’s roles as the economic regulator in light of the prevailing executive order and its concomitant superstructures.Whereas there had been reported cases of pockets of opposition here and there amongst critical players and development partners, such posturing has not in any way invalidated the council’s powers. They have helped to reinforce its importance in the current circumstances.The proof lies in the council’s increased powers of arbitration in import-export trade and shipping disputes, as well as operational costs regarded as arbitrary and overly oppressive for trade.Gradually, there is an improved industry understanding of the status of the council with its authority as the ombudsman whose interventions can no longer be ignored or neglected without consequences.Oversight functionsThe Nigerian Ports Process Manual and Ports Standing Task Team was one of the superstructures through which the NSC within the last two years had been able to maintain its oversight port economic regulation role. While NPPM simply encapsulates the general and specific rules for an efficient port system, the PSTT is given the mandate to drive the process and to ensure compliance. Every port user and player is wholly subject to the process.Under the last administration, PSTT, a sub-organ of the NSC, cleaved through various human barriers and restored efficiency to port trade across the board.Jime further ensured that the NSC evaluated the cost component of the entire shipping value chain through constant monitoring and engagement while promoting efficient service delivery as embedded in the NPPM.The NPPM is a harmonisation of the Standard Operating Procedures that were being operated by different entities now brought in as one document upon which everybody had arrived at a consensus. This is the document that will guide how the port industry functions.Referencing the effectiveness of these platforms, a clearing agent, Mr Tochukwu Nwegboi, said, “Today, we are happy to report that for instance, the average turnaround time in our ports has reduced drastically due to the activities of the PSTT, which has ensured the following of the strict provisions of the NPPM guidelines, so that now there is joint boarding of vessels.“There is also a joint examination of cargo. In the ports, we had different agencies of government who took their time and decided at their own pace whenever they would perform a function. This is no longer the case.“We believe that if you save time in the manner in which cargo examination is done if you save time in the manner in which you board the vessels that have berthed in our waters, there is a tremendous amount of efficiency that is then brought to bear on the conduct of business in the ports,” he Nwegboi said.According to him, shippers are happy that they have been given the tools by the establishment of the document and of the work of the ports having a task team that has collaborated and assisted all the other divisions that are present in the NSC.“Don’t forget the PSTT under Jime’s leadership has also extended its activities to cover access to the ports. We all remember many years ago, the gridlock that visited access into the ports, whether it is in the area of the trucks coming in, whether it is in the area of containers that were littering the ports. Now there is sanity, some level of order is beginning to develop and we can only continue in that pathway because it guarantees that we can be more sustainable in the way we are ensuring quality service delivery in our ports,” he asserted.Also, a clearing agent, Mr Johnpaul Ejiogu, said that the immediate past administration of NSC, recorded success in the area of improved export system, which was formerly heavily impaired by unwarranted superstructures put in place to extort shippers.

Apart from successfully tackling the issue of extortion along the port access roads, Jime also ensured a friendlier working environment in the sector and promoted stakeholders’ engagement, though some people argued the agency still needed to step on this.When he was appointed in June 2021 to replace Hassan Bello, many industry operators were skeptical about his ability to fill the shoes of his predecessor at the NSC, being a former managing director of the Nigerian Export Processing Zones Authority, Jime was relatively unknown in the port industry.Fostered collaborationThe Managing Director of ENL Consortium, Mark Walsh, said “When I look at the situations on the ground, they have been working directly with terminal operators and shipping companies to try and move the industry forward.

Jime’s appointment was greeted with resistance by some members of the council. Although the council is still struggling to take its place as the economic port regulator, under Jime, it had started to put structure in place that would enable it to carry out this function.For instance, the NSC has challenged the maritime command of the Nigerian Police Force over its involvement in cargo clearance processes in whatever guise as illegal and should be discontinued.The council had also made it clear to the Nigerian Ports Authority and Nigerian Inland Waterways Authority, that none had a direct duty to impose or determine costs of barging and evacuation of containerised cargoes from the port without its concurrent approval.Also, the council has taken very bold steps at reinventing the Ports Community Committee in such a manner as to be at par with the processes already established by the NPA which was formerly carrying out the assignment.There was also a growing call for sensitisation and advocacy on the council’s roles as the economic regulator in light of the prevailing executive order and its concomitant superstructures.Whereas there had been reported cases of pockets of opposition here and there amongst critical players and development partners, such posturing has not in any way invalidated the council’s powers.

The good … [+6072 chars]",News,"This summer's oxygen-poor ""dead zone"" in the Chesapeake Bay was the smallest since scientists started monitoring it in 1985, according to estimates by researchers in Maryland and Virginia.The good news for the bay could reflect the lower-than-average rainfall in the bay watershed this year, experts said. Rainwater carries pollutants into the Chesapeake, inundating the estuary with nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous from farm fields, lawns and city streets, which trigger the growth of algae blooms that draw oxygen from the water as they decompose, creating the dead zones.Though the dry weather this year meant many parts of Maryland experienced moderate drought conditions, it offered a welcome respite from pollution for bay wildlife, which experience stress and can perish in low oxygen conditions. But bay scientists also are hopeful that a string of smaller dead zones over the past four years indicate that strategies to reduce nutrient pollution flowing into the bay are working.This year, the bay region experienced warmer temperatures—which tends to worsen the dead zone because hotter water holds less oxygen—but the data still showed a record low. The region also experienced average wind speeds, while breezier conditions and big storms tend to help mix oxygen into deeper waters of the bay.""It's a testament that while you're seeing pressures through things likewarmer temperaturesand also population increase in the watershed, that we can still see these better-than-average results,"" said Mark Trice, the program chief of water quality informatics at the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, which conducts the bay survey along with Old Dominion University and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.The states surrounding the Chesapeake all pledged to reduce the flow of nutrient pollution into the bay by 2025, but it has become clear most states, including Maryland, will not meet their targets.Many states found early success outfitting sewage treatment plants with updated technology to filter nutrients out of wastewater before it's dumped into waterways. But, experts said, more needs to be done to address pollution from agriculture and livestock, as well as runoff that flows into urban storm drains, abetted by concrete and asphalt surfaces that don't absorb rainwater before it reaches the bay.Collectively, between 2009 and 2022, the bay states have met 51% of the nitrogen-reduction goal and 60% of the phosphorus-reduction goal, according to an estimate by the Chesapeake Bay Program, which oversees the bay effort.In addition, a report released earlier this year by the Bay Program's Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee indicated that the nutrient reductions achieved thus far have led to slower improvement in the bay's dissolved oxygen levels than originally hoped. That's particularly true in the bay's deepest channel, where dissolved oxygen concentrations already are lower. The report urged the Bay Program to focus more efforts on shallower tributaries, where improving conditions for wildlife might be more attainable.In response, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said his administration would modify its bay cleanup strategies in accordance with the recommendations.Even so, the past few years have been a bright spot for oxygen conditions in the bay, after heavy rainfall brought the dead zone to its highest level in decades in 2019, dealing blows to oysters, crabs and underwater grasses.To capture the data, researchers go out on the water and collect samples twice a month from May to October, whenoxygen levelsare likely to be worse than other times of the year. Then, the researchers at Maryland DNR use a computer model to figure out what those samples mean for the rest of the Chesapeake.Maryland estimated the volume of low-oxygen water was 0.52 cubic miles in the bay's main stem, while scientists in Virginia, using different methodology, came up with 0.58 cubic miles. Either way, the data point is a record, and well below the historical average of 0.97 cubic miles.For several months this summer, the low-oxygen conditions ensnared a smaller portion of the Chesapeake than in prior years, often centralized near the Bay Bridge and the middle of the main stem, according to Maryland DNR.""In the worst conditions, we can see it going from above the Bay Bridge all the way down past the Potomac and into certain parts of Virginia,"" Trice said.From May through August, the area of hypoxic—or low-oxygen—water was below average, and in early August the samples were better than they'd ever been at that time of year. September was worse than average, but in October researchers didn't find any hypoxic conditions.It came on the heels of a nearly snow-less winter for the Baltimore region and a fairly dry spring. At BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport, 14.33 inches of precipitation fell from January to June, compared to the historical norm of 21.21 inches, according to National Weather Service data.That meant less fresh water flowing into the bay. From October 2022 to September 2023, 65,649 cubic feet per second of water entered the Chesapeake from rivers and streams, compared to a long-term average of 79,000 cubic feet per second.But during the past few years, that flow—as measured by the U.S. Geological Survey—was considered normal, and the bay's dead zone still was better than the historical average.""There's a lot of news out there—stories where you'll see something good about the bay, and then maybe something not so good,"" Trice said. ""But I think this is really a hopeful report that people can keep in mind, that we need to continue. We've done a great job doing various management actions to restore the bay, and we just need to continue.""2023 The Baltimore Sun.

As the 28th edition of the Conference of the Parties (COP), the world’s foremost climate summit, begins in the United Arab Emirates on November 30, Africa is grappling with some of the deadliest impacts of a heating planet. The Horn of Africa, which suffered adrought earlier this year, is now battling floods. From Somalia to Kenya, extreme weather is forcing massdisplacement. Earlier this year, Cyclone Freddy, the longest-running tropical storm, hit Southern Africa, killing at least1,000 people. Amid these crises, the African Group of Negotiators (AGN), which is currently chaired by Zambia, will speak for the continent at the COP28 talks in Dubai. Although Africa is responsible for less than 5 percent of global emissions, it is disproportionately affected by negative climate change impacts. So, for African countries, fighting climate effects is urgent — and a matter of survival. Some of the biggest issues that the AGN will focus on, according to chief negotiator Ephraim Shitima, are a just energy transition and climate change finance, including funding for adaptation. Most countries by now agree that a pivot or transition away from fossil fuel production or consumption to renewables is inevitable, but a key issue African leaders are pushing is the continent’s right to a just transition. African countries, many of them low and middle-income developing economies, are negotiating for opportunities to accelerate theirfossil fuel productionto enable them to industrialise, before reinvesting those gains in green energy sources. The argument is that since developed countries became so by burning fossils to build factories and create generational wealth, African countries too, must be given the chance to accelerate their own development and provide energy to the millions lacking it on the continent, using these same fuels, particularly gas, which is seen as less polluting by some. At the moment, more than 600 million Africans do not have electricity and about 900 million cannot access clean cooking methods. There has been strong pushback on this position from the European Union but also African climate experts and activists. Some say all fossil production should be abandoned as there is no evidence that oil and gas-rich nations like Nigeria have reinvested oil wealth in renewables or even in development. A “dash for gas” will leave the continent stranded with assets that no one wants while renewable sources like wind and solar will help “leapfrog” development, others argue. “Both sides of the argument are actually right,” former African Union (AU) climate adviser Faten Aggad said. “Africa is vulnerable when oil prices crash, and that confirms what the activists are saying and whether we like it or not industry and trade are moving to renewables with major economies launching trade measures that threaten African countries,” she said. Aggad was referring to the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism which will see importers of goods taxed based on the amount of CO2 emitted during their production. On the other hand, “we are between a rock and a hard place”, Aggad said. “We are being sold this dream of renewables but we barely have any investments in it. Gas is the only option available to Africa.” Despite the controversies, the AGN at COP28 will propose that developed countries stop investing in fossil fuel projects by 2030 and let developing nations fill that gap. The issue of climate financing is set to come up once again. African countries have been demanding that rich countries support them with funds to build infrastructure and put in place measures that will help them adapt to a changing climate and a warmer world – infrastructure like sea walls for those countries facing significant sea level rise problems, for example. Those demands are in line with a UNFCCC principle enshrined in several agreements and resolutions called Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR), which acknowledges that while every country must be responsible for contributing to driving down temperatures, some countries are historically more responsible than others, and should take a lead in solutions. So far, the adaptation funds flowing to Africa have been a trickle. Rich countries promised $100bn in annual climate financing for developing nations back in 2009, and renewed that pledge at COP26 in Glasgow; but as of 2020, only $83bn was being raised annually. Onereportnotes that most of that money has been made available through loans and targeted countries outside Africa. Meanwhile, the continent needs more than $500bn for climate change adaptation costs through 2030, of which about $11bn was available in 2020. African negotiators have had success in recent summits. Intense lobbying – alongside countries from other regions – for more than three decades finally led to the creation of afund for loss and damageat last year’s conference in Egypt. For years, developed nations blocked the creation of the fund, which is meant to see low-emitting developing nations not historically responsible for global warming, get paid for the irreplaceable loss of lives, culture, and infrastructure by climate change, whether in Africa, Asia or elsewhere. Many see the enshrining of the fund in the final joint agreement as a big win for the fight for climate justice. The funds have not materialised yet, and it is still unclear where the money will come from precisely, as well as whether the largest emitters, like Russia and China, which are still under the “developing” nations category will also be required to contribute to the fund. A loss and damage transition committee is expected to present a suggested framework that will outline who contributes and who benefits from the fund in Dubai. COP talks have mostly focused on talk rather than action, especially from rich countries expected to provide climate financing and drastically cut their carbon emissions. Unfortunately, Aggad, the former AU adviser, said, African negotiators are usually unable to counter their richer counterparts. At the talks, lobbyists from developed countries often far outnumbered those from Africa or Asia. “The AGN focuses too much on COP when for developed countries, it’s more of a foreign diplomacy business with multiple ministries working on getting concessions on deals that AGN is not even aware of so by the time they get to COP, a lot has been sorted,” she said. “Africa needs to rethink how to negotiate. COP is just a moment [but] you need to tell your story in a continuous manner in the global space.” There is a lot at stake for African countries should COP negotiations this time fail to take the continent into account at a final sign-off. Already, Africa is warming faster than the rest of the world, according to an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, and sea levels here are rising faster than the global average. Besides, climate change progress for Africa is tightly wound with the continent’s development agenda. It is why African negotiators and leaders say they are more prepared to push for the funding and the leverage they need at COP28. Signalling their readiness, African heads of states planned ahead at the first African Climate Summit in Nairobi in August. In the resulting Nairobi Declaration, they urged their richer counterparts to commit to past funding pledges, reform unfavourable tax regimes, reduce borrowing costs for African countries, and restructure their debts. In addition to pursuing a right to use gas as a transition fuel, African leaders are also keen to position their countries as ones that can be crucial to climate solutions due to the continent’s natural resources and manpower needed to deliver infrastructure for renewables. Although Africa holds 40 percent of the world’s solar energy potential, for example, it has less than 1 percent installed capacity. Follow Al Jazeera English:"

That's the amount countries have agreed to limit warming to by the end of the century. The world is already perilously close to that number. Since the Industrial Revolution, the planet has warmed by about 1.2 degrees Celsius, predominantly due to heat-trapping emissions that come from burning fossil fuels. This year is expected to be the hottest on record, withtemperatures in Septemberreaching 1.8 degrees Celsius above average. Currently, theworld is on track for just under 3 degreesCelsius of warming (more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century. While a few degrees of difference may seem small, climate research shows that every tenth of a degree can have a profound effect when it comes to the dangers posed by extreme weather. ""We're not destined for some catastrophic climate,"" says Deepti Singh, who is an assistant professor at Washington State University. ""We know that we can have a future that is more equitable and less volatile if we limit the warming through our actions today."" Here are three climate impacts that get substantially worse in the U.S. if the world exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. When scientists use numbers like 1.5 degrees Celsius to measure climate change, it represents an average of all the annual temperatures worldwide. That average masks the fact that some parts of the planet are heating up faster than others. Loading... In fact, the U.S. is warming up at a faster rate than the global average, which means the effects of climate change will be more pronounced. That difference has to do with how the extra heat is absorbed, as well as regional weather patterns. Generally,warming is happening faster on landand in the polar regions. ""The U.S. has already warmed at a rate that's higher than the global average,"" says Singh. ""We're warming at a rate that's 60% higher than that."" Hurricanes and tropical storms are getting more intense as the climate warms, but they aren't the only storms affected. Even regular rainstorms are getting more extreme. ""Every time we have a heavy rainfall event, it's more likely to be even heavier than what we're typically used to seeing,"" says Deanna Hence, assistant professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. ""So that can mean flooding and other risks that come with those really high rainfall rates."" The air in a hotter atmosphere can hold more water vapor, which can fuel heavier rainfall. That means that beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, cities in the Midwest and Northeast will be faced with dramatically more water, which can overwhelm storm drains and infrastructure, causing flooding. Today,most cities aren't designing their infrastructureto handle more intense rain. Heat waves take a massive and sometimeshidden toll in the U.S., causing cardiovascular and other health impacts, in addition to deaths. Climate science shows they're already getting longer and more intense. Nighttime temperatures are also increasing, which exacerbates the effects of a heat wave. Humans, animals and plants need recovery time from extreme daytime temperatures. Without it, health impacts and crop losses are even greater. As the planet warms, winters will also be affected. The number of days below freezing would shrink past 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, especially in the Mountain West. That could impair the snowpack that provides a vital water source for millions of people.Warmer winterscan also harm crops and increase vector-borne diseases."

[+] truck to a home. Much hay has been made around the stress the influx of new electric vehicles (aka EVs) puts and will put on the electrical grid, especially as EVs continue to grow in popularity and market share. Now, according to a post on LinkedIn by Bill Crider, Head of Global Charging and Energy Services at Ford, the carmaker has teamed with electrical utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) for a pilot program in California that may more clearly illustrate the future of electrical distribution systems, and how electric vehicles - and our homes - will all interact with each other going forward. The base technological concept is known as Vehicle-To-Home, or V2H, while PG&E expands a bit on that idea and refers to its project as Vehicle-to-Everything. I’ve touched on this topic before but as EV and battery technology continues to mature, it’s becoming more clear that vehicle makers, urban planners and electrical systems engineers are getting more precise about how the various technologies will need to play nice together, and what possible problems will be encountered along the way. The Ford/PG&E project will put real hardware to the test along with hundreds of the popular Ford F-150 Lightning all-electric pickup trucks. “Phase 1 of the Vehicle-to Everything pilot is set to test backup power applications through bi-directional charging, including using the F-150 Lightning to power a home during a power outage. Subsequent phases of the pilot will include additional applications, including using the truck to offset grid power usage during times of peak energy demand,” Crider says in his post, adding that the pilot project is “now open to up to 1,000 residential customers who will receive at least $2,500 for enrolling, and up to an additional $2,175 in participation-based incentives.” That may sound like a lot of technobabble to some, but the basic idea is this: If you can plug your F-150 Lightning into your home’s electrical system to charge it up, why can’t the pickup truck then power your home if the power goes out? Expanding that concept, could thousands of electric vehicles, all plugged into home chargers, function as a sort of giant battery backup for a partial or widespread power grid failure? So far, the answer seems to be yes. How It Works Think of an electric car (or in this case, an electric pickup truck) as basically a giant mobile battery. The amount of energy stored in the batteries of EVs is enormous, even in a small EV like a Chevy Bolt or Nissan Leaf. In an emergency, all of that stored electrical power can flow out of a vehicle through the same wiring that charges it up using a technology called bi-directional charging. The U.S. actually got a quick peek at this idea when Texas was slammed by a winter storm and several Ford F-150 hybrid pickup truck owners used their vehicle’s built-in AC power inverters, batteries and motors to essentially power their homes when the electrical grid went down in areas across the state. The Ford/PG&E project is essentially codifying, improving and normalizing just such a system. Outside the United States, this is not exactly a new idea. Bi-directional charging and running electrical equipment off of an EV battery is already popular in China, especially in deeply rural areas where electrical service can be unreliable. But it’s also becoming more mainstream all over the country and the Chinese government is leaning into the tech as well. The Ford/PG&E pilot program in California signals that it may be an idea that will also flourish in the U.S. as EV adoption continues. Expanding the concept is the rising number of homes and businesses using solar arrays, which are often plugged into a large wall-mounted battery systems in the home or business. Those home-based batteries are essentially a close cousin to the power packs in an electric vehicles. Typified by the Tesla Powerwall, these battery storage systems essentially function as an upsized always-on Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) for an entire home or business. When the power goes out due to a storm or other issue, the battery takes over instantly without any interruption to the flow of power. The homeowner typically will only know a change has taken place when they get an app notification on their smartphone that the house has switched over to battery power. The capacity of such systems is essentially unlimited; just add more battery packs for more run time. V2H systems using an electric vehicle’s battery function essentially the same way, and when coupled with an in-home battery system and solar panels, can power a home for many days, or even indefinitely if the solar collection system, battery storage and electrical demands balance out. If the Ford/PG&E pilot program is successful, it will likely be a template for electrical and energy storage systems in many homes being built in the near future. Indeed, future homeowners may place great value on how large the battery and solar power system is on a perspective home. In that future, sophisticated electrical grids will digitally talk to electric cars, home batteries, solar arrays and even smaller energy storage devices like e-bikes to keep the power on no matter what kind of demands are placed on the grid. The technology to do all of this isn’t new, but it will need refinement. Eventually, the U.S. and likely every modernized country will move from the vulnerable “on-demand” electrical generation and consumption model we have now to a more reliable, more flexible “storage-based” system that will use ubiquitous electrical vehicles, home energy storage systems and widespread solar power installations to form a reliable and vast pool of reserve electrical power for periods of high demand."

On other days—when you are dealing with obstacles—it can make you want to throw in the towel and walk away. Below, 20 Forbes Business Development Council members each offer one tip to encourage business leaders and their teams not to give up on their short- and long-term goals in a tough economy. 1. Maintain Your Drive In Good Times And Bad Keep driving forward at all times and never look back in down economic times or in prospering times! Maintain your drive and commitment and the dividends will pay out over time. You will need to be more patient due to a lot of contacts changing seats or having internal issues on the other side, so you need to be mindful of what everyone around you is also going through. - Jack Wagner, Hawk Ventures 2. Find An Established Mentor It's important to find a mentor—ideally, it will be someone who has been in this business longer than you have and who can listen to you and provide advice during good times and bad times. More likely than not, they have experienced similar markets and economic situations and can serve as a source of motivation for you. Additionally, a good mentor will hold you accountable for said goals. - Hayden Stafford, Seismic 3. Develop Your Resilience Do not give up on short- and long-term goals in a tough economy. In times like these, setbacks and obstacles are inevitable. Resilience means developing the mental and emotional strength to bounce back from disappointments, adapting to changing circumstances and remaining committed to your goals. Stay flexible and be willing to adjust your strategies while keeping your long-term vision in mind. - Sarah Dant, 7Factor Software 4. Focus On Value Creation Stay laser-focused on value creation. It's easy to get discouraged when budgets tighten and deals take longer to seal. However, providing real value to customers is resistant to market fluctuations. During tough times, refocus on understanding your customers' highest priorities and crafting solutions that deliver significant ROI, operational efficiency or strategic advantage. - Somnath Roy, Google Cloud Forbes Business Development Council is an invitation-only community for sales and biz dev executives. Do I qualify? 5. Be Committed To Your Mission Statement History teaches us a lot. Overall, when a commodity is of ""value,"" then it will appreciate over time—whether it's gold, real estate or a successful business meeting a niche. Focus harder on your goals and stay committed to your mission statement. - Shahzad Anwar, Modern Aesthetics & Wellness 6. Play The Long Game In my experience, the most effective biz development professionals are those who play the long game versus the short game—specifically, with soft demand or economic downturn. For example, during the pandemic, top performers learned to reinvent themselves and their approach. Pitch a new solution, collaborate with trusted partners to devise new products that play into the new economy or market and innovate. - Christina Noble, Medikarma Inc. 7. Make Investments In Your Team During The Storm Everything is cyclical. The businesses that invest during the tough times will weather the storms and emerge even stronger once the economy turns around. We’ve seen many companies that invested in their people with sales training during the pandemic emerge as much stronger competitors. Biz dev professionals who are both consistent and persistent will win the long game. - Julie Thomas, ValueSelling Associates 8. Expand Global Market Reach To Diversify Revenue Streams Focusing on long-term goals while adapting to the economy and expanding into new global markets and industries can help diversify revenue and future-proof business. In the short term, focus on customer outcomes and differentiate yourself by leading with customer empathy and understanding what would drive their success even during measured buying decisions. - Tirtha Chavan, Salesforce 9. Find A Hobby, Exercise And Network Ups and downs are a part of any environment. People who can excel in both circumstances have an internal coping mechanism that will protect them from externalities. My top three recommendations are to find a hobby outside of work, practice a strong exercise regimen and build a network of friends. These breaks do more for the mind and keep you on top of your game. You should also make sure to get sound sleep at night. - Darsh Singh Mann, StartX 10. Explore Sectors With Enduring Demand In challenging economies, explore sectors with enduring demand, like energy or healthcare. Adapting your focus can safeguard your goals in both the short and long term. Flexibility and resilience can be key assets for success in a tough economy. - Kyle Pukylo, NuCycle Energy 11. Adjust Your Strategies, Embrace Innovation And Focus On Customer Needs It's essential to stay adaptive and resilient. In tough economies, revisiting and adjusting strategies, embracing innovative approaches and maintaining a steadfast focus on customer needs can uncover new opportunities and paths toward achieving both short- and long-term goals. - Tomer Warschauer Nuni, Pink Moon Studio Ltd 12. Develop Long-Term Incentive Policies And Reward Systems Set the guiding lighthouse. When the economic crisis comes, most companies try to set a contingency plan and a control tower. Normally, the next step is to adjust their basic plan to change it from the usual path to aggressive acceleration. To encourage them to achieve their goals, appropriate long-term incentive policies and frequent reward systems need to activate sustainable motivation. - Gyehyon Andrea Jo, MVLASF 13. Avoid Attempting To 'Control' The 'Uncontrollable' The basic yet most important action item for a business leader is ""not to control the uncontrollable""—and the unstable economy fits that cliché perfectly. Prevailing tough economic conditions should be forecasted and then factored in so that both short- and long-term goals can be adjusted accordingly. Giving up on it will require you to double your time and resources. It will also provide an open invitation for your competition to leapfrog. - Mustansir Paliwala, Zomara Group & EQUANS 14. Read Autobiographies To Get Inspired By Others' Ability To Overcome Read the autobiographies of legends in your industry and business world to learn about how they weathered similar storms. It is a sure and relatable way to navigate the tough economy. In addition, keep a dashboard of short- and long-term goals with a focus on low-hanging fruits and having a realistic view of survival strategies. Having a large dose of optimism doesn’t hurt. - Folasade Femi-Lawal, FirstBank of Nigeria Ltd 15. Level Up Your Game With Attitude And Grit In tough times, we have to level up the game. The sellers who don't will not make it and will indeed learn a tough lesson. Becoming better at understanding our clients’ pain, getting better at building trust at all levels, positioning oneself as a true partner and making sure we show the value for every dollar clients invest are ways to maximize opportunities. Attitude and grit are key. - Alex Llorens, Contentsquare 16. Elevate Your Skills To Compete In The Marketplace A tough economy is the perfect time to clear the herd of all those people who jumped into business development because it looked easy. This is the time when the very best sales professionals will rise to the top and dominate, while the rest of the crowd will find themselves starving because they are ill-prepared and do not have the necessary skills to operate in a truly competitive environment. - Vincent Burruano, Vince Burruano Consulting Services, LLC 17. Be Adaptable And Persistent My tip is to be adaptable and persistent no matter the economic environment. Challenges are always going to come up. It's part of the process. So, everyone has to expect setbacks to achieve any short- or long-term goal. Therefore, the biggest skill professionals can have is to stay at it, even if they have to pivot from time to time to adjust their course based on what they learned from their setbacks. - Wayne Elsey, The Funds2Orgs Group 18. Remain Disciplined And Avoid Unfavorable Cost Structures Discipline is key. Unfavorable macroeconomic trends are highly cyclical and historically never last more than a few years at a time. Any historical periods of high inflation or economic recession have always been followed by economic growth and prosperity. The key is to not lock yourself into unfavorable cost structures now at peak prices that will be highly disadvantageous in future years. - Jim Mizouni, Sage Dental 19. Keep Your Clients Happy To Minimize Any Business Loss Sales cycles can be long, and the prospecting you do today can pay off months or years from now. If you capture market share in a down economy, you can grow exponentially as it rebounds. Keeping your clients happy is a great start for the short term as well. Minimize the business you lose to the competition and maximize your biz dev efforts to keep the pipeline as full as possible. - David Mattson, Sandler 20. Stay Confident And Surround Yourself With Positive Energy It is important to maintain your focus and self-belief when the economy is tough. Keep the positive approach and surround yourself with positive energy from friends and family. It is critical to not allow yourself to take shortcuts or indulge in things that will haunt you at a later stage in business. - Roshan Kumar Shetty, Tech Mahindra Limited"

[+] on Saturday. Photo: Markus Hibbeler/dpa (Photo by Markus Hibbeler/picture alliance via Getty Images) UPDATE: original quotes were added to reflect exactly where and when aurora will be visible in the U.S. as well as information about the two models predicting solar activity. Scientists think a severe geomagnetic storm will strike Earth this Thursday, potentially triggering significant displays of the northern lights at mid-latitudes—and that means as far south as Oregon, Wyoming and Illinois. Experts sounded the alarm Tuesday after a solar flare caused three separate coronal mass ejections on the sun, all aimed toward Earth, creating a rare “halo CME.” A CME is a cloud of magnetic fields and charged particles from the sun that streams into space at up to 1,900 miles (3,000 kilometers) per second. UPDATE: The latest estimated arrival time is Thursday night for U.S. and about 4:00 a.m. GMT for the U.K. There could also be a good show in the U.K on Friday night. G3+ Geomagnetic Storm Predicted “Space weather forecasters are predicting a potential G3+ geomagnetic storm later this week,” said Dr. Ryan French, a solar physicist at the National Solar Observatory (NSO) in Boulder, Colorado and the author of The Sun: Beginner’s Guide To Our Local Star, in an email. “In the U.S. a G3 storm arriving at local night could give aurora as far south as Oregon, Wyoming and Illinois!” In his book, French writes that while G2 storms can be seen as far south as New York and Idaho, for G3 it’s Illinois and Oregon and for G4 it’s Alabama and northern California. However, the G3 storm prediction is based on the NASA model while the competing model from the NOAA predicts a slightly lower G2 storm. When To See The Northern Lights This Week According to the NASA model, Earth will be struck by a CME at midday Universal Time (around 7:00 a.m. EST) on Friday, December 1. That makes Friday night the best time to look for aurora. However, SpaceWeather.com states that it could arrive the day before, making Thursday and Friday the best nights to go out looking for aurora. A CME can take a few days to travel from the sun to the Earth, where the charged particles accelerate down the field lines of Earth’s magnetic field. The result is a geomagnetic storm, often resulting in an oval of green and red around our planet’s poles and down to mid-latitudes if it’s strong enough. The effects of a solar flare take just eight minutes to travel from the sun at light speed and can cause a radio blackout. Predicting The Aurora The intensity of aurora displays is tricky to predict in advance, but this week, we could see a severe geomagnetic storm. While G1 and G2-class geomagnetic storms are relatively common, G3 and even G4-class storms—rated strong and severe, respectively—are being predicted. SpaceWeather.com reports that the CME that strikes on Friday could sweep up one of several slower CMEs ahead of it to become a “cannibal CME.” “Along with two earlier storms already en route means we have a 1,2,3-punch,” said space weather physicist Dr. Tamitha Skov, on X. “If the magnetic field is oriented correctly, expect aurora to reach deep into mid-latitudes ... G3+ conditions are possible with this storm series.” ‘The G3 prediction is the most probable forecast, but a complicated one based on the number of CMEs expected to arrive in a short window,” said French. “This could create conditions greater than a G3 (in which we’d see the aurora even further south), or equally, give us less than expected.” How To See The Northern Lights Sightings of aurora have become more frequent in recent months because the sun is approaching the “solar maximum” phase of its 11-year solar cycle. However, sightings from regions south of the Arctic Circle tend only to get glimpses of aurora as a faint glow on the northern horizon, so that’s where aurora hunters should look from North America. It also helps to have a dark sky away from light pollution (check the Light Pollution Map), which can cause observers to confuse aurora with city lights and the afterglow of sunset. For the best chance, plan a trip in the next two to three years to the Arctic Circle (65- to 70-degree north latitudes) in Alaska, northern Canada or northern Scandinavia (Norway, Finland, Sweden and Iceland), where more frequent and brighter displays are more likely. Wishing you clear skies and wide eyes."

The world's largest retailer shipped one quarter of its U.S. imports from India between January and August this year, according to bill of lading figures shared with Reuters by data firm Import Yeti. That compared with just 2% in 2018. The data shows that only 60% of its shipments came from China during the same period, down from 80% in 2018. To be sure, China is still Walmart's biggest country for importing goods. The shift illustrates how the rising cost of importing from China and escalating political tensions between Washington and Beijing are encouraging large U.S. companies to import more from countries including India, Thailand and Vietnam. In the U.S., shoppers face higher interest rates and high food prices, eroding household savings and prompting Walmart and other retailers to become cautious in their outlook for consumer spending. ""We want the best prices,"" Andrea Albright, Walmart's executive vice president of sourcing said in an interview. ""That means I need resiliency in our supply chains. I can't be reliant on any one supplier or geography for my product because we're constantly managing things from hurricanes and earthquakes to shortages in raw materials."" In a statement, Walmart said the bill of lading data painted a partial picture of what it sourced and that creating redundancy ""does not necessarily mean"" it was reducing reliance on any of its sourcing markets. ""We're a growth business and are working to source more manufacturing capacity,"" Walmart said. India has emerged as a key component of Walmart's efforts to build that manufacturing capacity, Albright said. Walmart has been accelerating growth in India since 2018, when it bought a 77% stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart. Two years later, it committed to import $10 billion of goods from India each year by 2027. That is a target it remains on track to hit, Albright said. It is currently importing around $3 billion worth of goods from India each year. WORKFORCE, TECHNOLOGY ARE KEY DRAWS Walmart is importing goods ranging from toys and electronics to bicycles and pharmaceuticals from India to the U.S., Albright said. Packaged food, dry grains and pasta are also popular imports from India, she added. India, whose stock market has risen to record highs this year, is viewed as the country best equipped to outperform China in low-cost, large-scale manufacturing. Its rapidly growing workforce and technological advancement were a draw for Walmart, Albright said. China on the other hand reported its first decline in population in six decades last year. Walmart started its sourcing operations in Bangalore in 2002. Now, the company employs more than 100,000 people, including temporary workers, in the country spread across several offices under its Walmart Global Tech India unit, Flipkart Group, PhonePe and sourcing operations. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May this year, a meeting that Modi termed ""a fruitful one."" ""Happy to see India emerge as an attractive destination for investment,"" Modi wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on May 14. McMillon said Walmart would ""continue to support the country's manufacturing growth and create opportunity."" Walmart rival Amazon said this month it is targeting merchandise exports worth $20 billion from India by 2025. Freewill Sports, a small Indian supplier of soccer balls, is one company that has benefited, its Chief Executive Rajesh Kharabanda said in an interview. The rising cost of shipping goods from China has also contributed to the switch to India, supply chain experts say. ""Sourcing from mainland China has become less competitive because of rising labor costs versus other manufacturing centers,"" said Chris Rogers, research analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence's supply chain analysis group Panjiva. China's minimum wage changes from province to province and sometimes even from city to city, with a range between 1,420 yuan per month and 2,690 yuan per month ($198.52 - $376.08). Meanwhile, average wages for unskilled and semi-skilled workers in India range from about 9,000 Indian rupees to 15,000 Indian rupees a month ($108.04 - $180.06), according to central bank estimates. SUPPLY CHAIN SNAGS The COVID-19 pandemic exposed weaknesses in global supply chains, showing U.S. importers to be over-reliant on a small number of markets. ""Planning for a geopolitical event is like planning for a hurricane,"" said Albright. ""What I can control is where my product is coming from and how do I make sure that Christmas still happens if something happens in our supply chain."" Pakistan and Bangladesh have also benefited from Walmart's strategy, expanding as suppliers of home and apparel products, Albright said. Last year, at least eight Freewill shipments sailed to Walmart warehouses from Mundra Port in Gujarat, the largest private port in India, according to U.S. import data. ""There is a newfound confidence in the Indian manufacturing industry and also the availability of factory infrastructure,"" Freewill's Chief Executive Rajesh Kharabanda said in an interview. India's central bank forecasts that the country's economy will expand 6.5% this fiscal year . China is expected to grow around 5% this year. ""In the last 12 to 18 months there has certainly been a bigger impact,"" said Shekhar Gupta, whose family business Devgiri has been selling floor rugs to Walmart for about a decade. ""That's when Walmart started putting a true strategy behind how they wanted India at the center of their growth."" ( Originally published on Nov 29, 2023 ) "
